If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). The Notice to Vana should be sent to Attn: Legal, Corsali, Inc. dba Vana, 548 Market St, PMB 77861, San Francisco, CA 94104 (“<strong>Notice Address</strong>”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Vana and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Vana may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Vana or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vana is entitled.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></li></ol><p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="https://www.adr.org/">https://www.adr.org</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p><p>Unless Vana and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Vana agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong></li></ol><p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Vana or you under the AAA Rules, Vana and you shall split them equally; <em>provided</em> that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Vana will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Vana will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong></li></ol><p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, must be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Severability</strong></li></ol><p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement</strong></li></ol><p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Vana agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Vana written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p><p><strong>Termination</strong></p><p>Vana reserves the right to monitor the Sites, Service, and Platform for violations of the Terms of Service.  You agree that Vana, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your Account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including for lack of use or if Vana believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Vana may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Vana may immediately deactivate or delete your Account and all related information and files in your Account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Vana will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.  If Vana terminates or suspends your Account for a violation of these Terms of Service, you may not register a new Account under your name, any other name, or a third party, even if you are acting on a third party&#x27;s behalf.</p><p><strong>User Disputes</strong></p><p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service, and Vana will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Vana reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p><p><strong>General</strong></p><p>These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Vana governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Vana with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Vana submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the County of San Francisco, California. The failure of Vana to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Vana, but Vana may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. Vana will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond Vana’s reasonable control.</p><p><strong>Notice for California Users</strong></p><p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users of the Service from California are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted (a) via email at <a href="mailto:dca@dca.ca.gov">dca@dca.ca.gov</a>; (b) in writing at: Department of Consumer Affairs, Consumer Information Division, 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834; or (c) by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (800) 326-2297 (TDD).
