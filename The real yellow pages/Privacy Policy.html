If we assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.</p><h2>8. <strong>Arbitration Agreement &amp; Waiver of Certain Rights</strong></h2><p>Except as set forth below, you and we agree that we will resolve any controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (each a <span class="strong-italic">"Claim"</span>) through binding and final arbitration, instead of through court proceedings, in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("<span class="strong-italic">AAA Rules</span>"). This arbitration agreement applies to any existing or future Claims that you have not individually filed in a court of law prior to the date you agreed to these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. However, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, validity, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.</p><p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send us an individual letter signed by you requesting arbitration and describing your claim at 2200 West Airfield Dr., PO Box 619810, DFW Airport, TX 75261, Attn: Chief Legal Officer. This letter must be sent at least five (5) days before you initiate an arbitration proceeding against us.</p><p>Any party to the arbitration may, at any time more than ten (10) days before arbitration, serve an offer of compromise in writing upon any other party to the action. Offers of compromise pursuant to these Terms will be adjudicated and interpreted in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 998.</p><p>If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p><p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court or transfer qualifying claims to small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.</p><p>Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. You may not bring Claims in arbitration on a class, consolidated or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated without prior written consent of the parties. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction" and any such "public injunction" may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party seeks a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief." In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.</p><p>If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with us.<br></p><p>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p><h2>9. <strong>Marketing Contacts</strong></h2><p>If you have provided a phone number, mobile phone number and/or email address for contact purposes, you consent to receiving commercial and transactional telephonic or electronic correspondence from Yahoo and Thryv at such number or address via phone call, email, or text, including via auto-dialer or recorded message.
