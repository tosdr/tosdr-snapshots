<p align="justify"><a>The parties to this agreement are (the company aixeno inc. acting through its website aixeno.com and the consumer) are altogether ready, able and willing to attempt to resolve any actual disputes that may arise during the existence of this arbitration agreement as a first step, by dealing with each other directly in good-faith and in a civil and lawful manner.  All parties to this arbitration agreement mutually promise to notify in writing all other parties that have signed this arbitration agreement, of any dispute, controversy, claim or significant disagreement, and the parties further expressly agree that the promise and pledge to notify the parties is in effect during the existence of this arbitration agreement.</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a>Should any party to this arbitration agreement have any dispute that is not resolved by dealing directly with each other, then as a second step for dispute resolution, then the parties expressly acknowledge that they are willing to arbitrate their dispute(s) in a manner and by using the method required by the jurisdiction of the consumer’s residence.</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a>For residents of Washington State, and as required by law by Spokane County Superior Court’s formal Arbitration legal process, Spokane County Superior Court requires mandatory arbitration for civil cases claiming monetary damages of $100,000 U.S.D. or less.  The Court’s purpose of requiring mandatory arbitration is to provide a speedy and fair resolution of civil cases.  The arbitrator panel is made up of lawyers in the community who volunteer to serve as arbitrators for the court.</a></p> 

<p align="justify"><a>The parties to this arbitration agreement expressly agree to be bound by the following arbitration provisions:</a></p>
	
<p align="justify"><a>In circumstances of any breach of contract involving any digital solutions and digital technologies made by the company aixeno inc., the company may use arbitration to settle disputes, according to the following terms and conditions.  Any controversy, claim, or allegation of breach of contract, that arises out of, or relates to any lawful contracts made by aixeno inc., that are less than $ 100,000 U.S.D., shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator(s) shall be a currently licensed attorney in good standing with the Washington State Bar Association  (www.wsba.org).  The place of arbitration shall be Spokane, WA, USA.

Pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, the arbitrators will have the authority to allocate the costs of the arbitration process among the parties but will only have the authority to allocate attorneys' fees if a particular law permits them to do so.  The award of the arbitrators shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion.  Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.  The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator(s) may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the contract documents, the parties hereby agree: that the Underlying Award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA's Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules ("Appellate Rules"); that the Underlying Award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall, at a minimum, be a reasoned award; and that the Underlying Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Underlying Award, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process the decision rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</a>

<p align="justify"><a><b>2-Step Verification, 2FA, 2.F.A. - Two-Factor Authentication</b> - </a>electronic verification(s) of an end-user, consumer, or customer, at sign-in/log-in to an electronic resource, through a two-step process of evaluating an end-user's credentials by referring to and matching identical added secret codes and unique identifying information.  The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage.  The second step to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a 2FA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random code of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the 2FA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using 2FA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added 2FA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user.  An "electronic resource" may include: any computer system, computer networks, apps, software programs, protected webpages, messaging apps, financial services, banking webpages, or databases.</p>

<p align="justify"><a><b>LLM - L.L.M. - Large Language Model</b> - human interaction with a computer using natural human language for questions and answers from an enormous data source.  An LLM is often made from a software program, database, and a vast dataset of text information, which is evaluated by machine learning algorithms to examine and analyze language data through several artificial neural network matrices to discover statistical patterns of word frequencies, which could be used to form statistically plausible answers to questions given to the computer as prompts.  A Large Language Model often requires reinforcement training from humans, significant computer processing and network resources, and several million dollars in total research and development costs to produce a functional LLM.  The artificial intelligence of a Large Language Model is its software program code acting on language model data by relying on machine learning results to simulate human intelligence during the "chat-based" exchange of information.

The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage.  The second and subsequent steps to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a MFA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random codes of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the MFA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using MFA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added MFA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user.  An "electronic resource" may include: any computer system, computer networks, apps, software programs, protected webpages, messaging apps, financial services, banking webpages, or databases.
