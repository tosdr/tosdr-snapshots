</p>
<ol type="1">
<h2><li>Refund and Disputes</li></h2>
<p>
All server plans are eligible for refunds within 7 days of the creation of the server in our database, this point is not marked by the time at which your initial payment is processed and may differ by several hours or days. Refunds cannot be requested without probable cause; one time purchases such as Managment Packs Express, Premium, Ultimate or Extreme, Extended Modpack Support, Bungeecord Support are non-refundable once they have been used. In addition, downgrading of a server plan will be applied to the client’s account as a credit for the remaining balance of the monthly billing cycle. Any credit applied to the account from downgrading the server plan is also non-refundable. Credit added using the “Add Funds” function is non-refundable and is automatically applied to your invoice each pay period.
</p>
<p>
All gift card purchases are final and non-refundable.
</p>
<p>
Any accounts which initiate a chargeback or dispute on a payment will have their services automatically terminated and the account closed.
</p>
<p>
We may require additional information in order to process any refunds. After receiving a refund request, we will reach out via e-mail to confirm. If a confirmation is not received, we are not responsible for any subsequent charges or late issuance of the refund.
</p>
<p>
All services are subject to termination upon arrival of a dispute on a relevant payment.
</p>
<h2><li>Cancellations</li></h2>
<p>
Service cancellations must be placed via the Request Cancellation area in our <a href="https://mcprohosting.com/billing">client panel</a>. Cancellation requests may also be submitted to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#33505c5d47525047735e5043415c5b5c40475a5d541d505c5e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ffcf0f1ebfefcebdff2fcefedf0f7f0ecebf6f1f8b1fcf0f2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or via our <a href="https://mcprohosting.com/support">contact form</a>.
<br><br>
The client will have the option to specify a cancellation at the end of the billing period for the service in question or, during some periods, immediate cancellation is offered. Immediate cancellations are permanent and cannot be aborted. A cancellation request does not guarantee a refund - a refund must be explicitly requested and is subject to our Refunds and Disputes policies.
<br><br>
MCProHosting does not have access to any client's PayPal account. MCProHosting will attempt to cancel PayPal subscriptions via API requests after receipt of a cancellation request, however, it is the client's responsibility to ensure any active PayPal subscriptions to MCProHosting are cancelled via their PayPal. Therefore, we cannot and will not be responsible for unintended payments made via the automatic payment subscription service. <a href="https://clients.mcprohosting.com/knowledgebase/255/How-to-Cancel-a-Paypal-Subscription.html">Click here</a> for more information on how to cancel a PayPal Subscription.

</p>
<p>
<h2><li>Live Chat</li></h2>
</p>
<p>
By starting a chat with a support representative, you agree to the following terms of service:<br><br>
Breaching any of these terms will result in the Live Chat privilege being revoked from the client either temporarily (up to 72 hours) or permanently. We reserve the right to revoke access to Live Chat at our discretion.
</p>
<h3>Name and Email</h3>
<p>
All clients must use the email address and name associated with their account to use the Live Chat system.
</p>
<h3>Harassment and Threats</h3>
<p>
Using MCProHosting’s Live Chat system to transmit any material that harasses another person, including but not limited to MCProHosting and/or its staff and partners, profanity, threats and destruction of property are forbidden and may result in Live Chat privileges being revoked.
</p>
<h3>Level of Support</h3>
<p>
The Live Chat system is to be used for informational purposes only. MCProHosting cannot guarantee the resolution of any issue you may have with our services during your session, even if you have purchased add-ons such as Premium Support, Mod Support or Plugin Setup.
<br><br>
Some issues can only be handled through a support ticket. The support representative will direct you to the appropriate department if it is required.
<br><br>
Support agents are prohibited from coming onto your server to help resolve issues while you are in the Live Chat system.
<br><br>
MCProHosting can only offer support for the services that it provides and only to the client who purchased the services.
</p>
<h3>Security and Verification</h3>
<p>
There are certain aspects where due to the lack of verification, the user must submit a ticket with the billing account associated with the product in question. This must be done to verify that you are the account owner.
</p>
<h2><li>MySQL Agreement</li></h2>
<p>
While we offer instant database creation from our control panel, you need to understand that our databases are provided as a free service. Because of this we do not hold any liability for MySQL data loss or corruption. By using a database provided by MCProHosting, you understand that we reserve the sole right to terminate it if we deem it necessary. Additionally, our MySQL service is not to be used for personal use, this is not limited to but includes the usage of MySQL for private websites, and other non-server uses.
</p>
<h2><li>Promotions</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting cannot guarantee that all promotions and promo codes will remain operational at all times.
</p>
<h2><li>Legal Contact</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting retains the right to seek and consult with any appropriate authorities that may need to be involved in the event of an issue arising whether it is through violation of this policy or any other illegal occurrence requiring involvement of law-enforcement agencies.
</p>
<p>
MCProHosting regards any communication between parties as confidential, upon distribution of any communication, unless prior approval is in place, we will take action to the fullest extent of the law. By purchasing a server from MCProHosting you permit us to modify your server, this includes, but is not limited to, changing plugins, updating your server software and other tasks related to running a game server.
</p>
<p>
Any verbal or written threats to compromise our server systems or any other equipment owned by MCProHosting will be taken seriously and will result in further investigation and potentially litigation. Upon cancellation of payments to MCProHosting your server will be suspended. Files will be kept as long as possible after termination or suspension; however the guaranteed amount of time is unspecified. MCProHosting retains the sole right to stop, start, and modify your server.
</p>
<h2><li>Unlimited Storage Policy</li></h2>
<p>
Disk space on shared hosting services is not limited. However, we reserve the right to remove excessive file(s) such as large logs, redundant backups, or other files that may impact the node. This policy is in place to protect our users, since full disks (SSDs) can, and will, cause corruption of many files on the drive.
</p>
<h2><li>Bandwidth usage</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting does not limit the bandwidth of shared hosting services. However, MCProHosting reserves the right to take corrective action if the bandwidth used by the Customer adversely affects the MCProHosting network.
<br>
If the Customer uses excessive bandwidth, and is found to have intentionally or unintentionally used custom software or networking tools attributed to the overuse of bandwidth, including but not limited to proxy servers and custom software (“custom JARs”), the Customer will be subject to three times (3x) the overage charges incurred by MCProHosting for bandwidth attributable to the Customer’s service, and may have their services terminated at MCProHosting’s discretion.
<br>
Dedicated server customers are obligated to pay any and all bandwidth overage fees as these are imposed by the server provider, not MCProHosting.
</p>
<h2><li>Unfair usage</li></h2>
<p>
If we find your server using any sort of system to bypass limits put on your server (such as slots or RAM amount) your server is subject to being terminated without refund.
</p>
<h2><li>Suspension and Termination</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting will suspend your service 5 days after the service becomes overdue. If you anticipate being unable to make your payment on time, please contact our support team. Suspension will prevent use of the service until any due invoices are paid.
<br/><br/>
MCProHosting will terminate your service after it remains overdue for 14 days. If you anticipate being unable to make your payment on time, please contact us. Termination will result in the service's files being removed from MCProHosting systems.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, we reserve all rights to suspend or terminate your server or service upon any violation of these terms, or any other basis if deemed needed.
</p>
<h2><li>Trial Services</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting offers trial servers for a period of 7 (seven) 24 (twenty-four) hour days. Starting a trial service requires that you have a valid credit/debit card on-file.
<br><br>
There is no charge during the free trial, but if you do not cancel your service during the trial period, you’ll be billed on the 6th day of the trial for the full price of the service for the following month.
<br><br>
Refund requests for trial services are subject to the same terms and conditions as described in Section 1. Refunds and Disputes.
<br><br>
If you cancel your trial, or the trial period elapses without payment, the trial service will be terminated and removed from our systems. This includes removal of files, logs, and any configuration changes made to the trial service.
<br><br>
MCProHosting cannot guarantee data recovery of any files or changes lost due to a trial service that expired.
<br><br>
Free trials are reserved for new customers only. If you have an existing account with MCProHosting, you are not eligible to receive a free trial service.
<br><br>
Refund requests for trial services are subject to the same terms and conditions as described in <b>Section 1. Refunds and Disputes</b> referencing Automatic Recurring payments.
<br><br>
In the event that a trial plan is not converted to a paid plan, it may be subject to termination on the 7th day of service. MCProHosting cannot guarantee data recovery of any files or changes lost due to a trial service that expired.
</p>
<h2><li>Free Services</li></h2>
<p>
MCProHosting offers free servers with specific limitations and terms. Starting a free service does not require a valid credit/debit card on file. MCProHosting requires a credit/debit card to be on file in order to process upgrades to a paid service. If a free service remains unused for 14 (fourteen) 24 (twenty-four) hour days, it will be subject to termination on the 14th day of service. File restoration services may be provided to free server users with an active billing account. Restoration services may be requested at any time through MCProHosting’s official support avenues. MCProHosting cannot guarantee data recovery of any files or changes lost due to a service that was terminated due to inactivity. MCProHosting reserves the right to limit or remove service features at any time.
</p>
<h2><li>Card Enforcement</li></h2>
<h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
<p>You authorize us to store your payment method of choice and use it in connection with your use of the Services and Software as described in your Subscription and Cancellation Terms. To avoid interruption of your service, we may participate in programs supported by your card provider to try to update your payment information. You authorize us to continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain.</p>
<h2><li>Annual Subscription</li></h2>
<h3>Cancellation Terms</h3>
<p>
You can cancel an ongoing subscription at any time by submitting a request through the WHMCS billing platform or by contacting Support through official channels such as LiveChat or Ticket services. Mention of cancellation in an unofficial channel will not be accepted.
<br>
If a cancellation is received during a trial period, you will not be charged.<br>
<br>
If you cancel within (7) seven days of the start of your paid subscription, you may be eligible for a full refund.<br>
</p>
