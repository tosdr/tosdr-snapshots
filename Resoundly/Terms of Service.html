<h3>SECTION 20 &#8211; SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Resoundly cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Resoundly customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Resoundly with accurate and complete billing information including full name, email, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Resoundly to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Resoundly will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
<h3>SECTION 21 &#8211; FREE TRIAL</h3>
<p>Resoundly may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).</p>
<p>The terms of the Free Trial are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Free Trial is for 2-days or 5-days (depending on the plan you register for), starting from the date on which you registered for your account.</li>
<li>You are only allowed to have ONE Free Trial per account per user.</li>
<li>You have the option to cancel your subscription from within your team account, prior to the end of the free trial period.</li>
<li>Once the Free Trial ends:
<ul>
<li>The payment method you supplied at the time of registration will automatically be charged the amount for the plan that you&#8217;ve selected (either at time of registration or the plan you switched to post-registration).</li>
<li>Unless your payment was successful to cover the first month’s fees (“Subscribe”), your account will be disabled, during which time, visitors to your RSS feed will see a message stating that the Website is no longer available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you do not Subscribe within 90 days following the end of the Free Trial, the account and all data (including files) will be queued for deletion.</li>
<li>If you do not cancel your subscription within the free trial period, and request a refund (for example you forgot to cancel) &#8211; Resoundly reserves the right to withhold a refund.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any time and without notice, Resoundly reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
<h3>SECTION 22 &#8211; FEE CHANGES</h3>
<p>Resoundly in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Resoundly will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a free trial to any paid Plan, we will immediately bill you for the applicable Subscription Fees. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.</p>
