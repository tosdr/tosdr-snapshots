        </p><p>We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 below. For example, we may use Tracking Technologies to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>3.2.2 Third Parties&#x27; Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</strong>
        This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, &quot;Third Party Service Providers&quot;) to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (&quot;Customized Advertising&quot;) and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site.

        </p><p>Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.</p>
        <p>We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site.</p>
        <p>Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.

            <li>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser&#x27;s support feature.</li>
            <li>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser&#x27;s support features.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many tools discussed above are &quot;Internet browser cookie based.&quot; This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms herein, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.</li>
            <li>The tools are &quot;Internet browser and Device-specific&quot; or &quot;Device-specific&quot; Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below).</li>
            <li>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs. Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function. For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance&#x27;s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>
            <li>You shall still receive advertisements. Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers&#x27;, Advertisers&#x27; or the Site&#x27;s Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in Section 3.2 above.</li>
            <li>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</li>
            <li>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). CONTROL OF FLASH LSOS (SOMETIMES KNOWN AS FLASH COOKIES) MUST BE HANDLED SEPARATELY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs. For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</a>. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.</li>
            <li>Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies. In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings or other purposes described in Section 4.2 above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</li>
            <li>Mobile Platforms. Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.</li>
            <li>Certain Identifiers. Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.</li>
            <li>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, or if and when required by applicable law or regulation, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</li>

    <strong>10. California Residents: Notice of Privacy Rights.</strong>
    We provide this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the &quot;CCPA&quot;). Any capitalized terms used in this notice which are not defined herein have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA. 
    <p>Under the CCPA, we, as a &quot;Business,&quot; are required to provide CA Residents with certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, as well as certain rights to their personal information, including the right to access, delete, and correct certain personal information we collect about them. The law also restricts the &quot;Sale&quot; or &quot;Sharing&quot; of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and limits the use of &quot;Sensitive Personal Information,&quot; as defined by the law and described below. It also provides that California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising the privacy rights described in this notice.</p>

        <strong>10.1 Categories of Personal Information Collected, Purpose for Collection, and Categories of Third Parties with whom CA Personal Information is Disclosed for a Business Purpose.</strong>

The table below lists: (i) the categories of CA Personal Information we have collected about consumers in the preceding 12 months; (ii) the categories of sources of that information; (iii) the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected; and (iv) the categories of third parties with whom it was disclosed (including Service Providers as we define the term above).

        <strong>10.2 Right to Opt out of the Sale and/or Sharing of CA Personal Information.</strong>
        We consider our allowing third parties to use Tracking Technologies to collect Information on the Site for Customized Advertising and other purposes described in Section 3.2.2 to be a &quot;Sale &quot; or &quot;Sharing&quot; of personal information under California law. CA Residents can opt out of the Sale and/or Sharing of their CA Personal Information by clicking on the CA Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info link. We do not knowingly Sell or Share the CA Personal Information of any CA Residents under the age of 17.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>10.3 Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.</strong>
        Certain CA Personal Information is considered &quot;Sensitive Personal Information&quot; under California law, including racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, information regarding a mental or physical health condition or diagnosis, information regarding sex life or sexual orientation, citizenship or immigration status, union membership, genetic or biometric data, and precise geolocation data. We do not knowingly collect Sensitive Personal Information from CA Residents. To the extent that any of the information you provide or we otherwise collect about you is Sensitive Personal Information under California law, we will only use and disclose such information for the purposes specific in Section 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>10.4 How to Exercise Right to Know, Correct and Deletion Requests and Non-Discrimination.</strong>
        CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them. CA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information we collected from them, subject to certain exceptions (such maintaining the information to continue to provide our services), and to correct their CA Personal Information if it is inaccurate.
        </p><p>For all Site users, the categories of information we collect, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared are described above.</p>
        <p>CA Residents may submit requests to know the specific pieces of CA Personal Information collected about them, to correct inaccurate CA Personal Information, or to have their personal information deleted by emailing us at <a href="mailto:CCPA@ratemyprofessors.com">CCPA@ratemyprofessors.com</a>. Requests may also be submitted via the request forms available here (for right to know specific pieces of CA Personal Information collected) and here (for deletion) and CA Residents may correct and update inaccurate CA Personal Information as described in Section 8 above. We will only be able to honor such requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify. Registered Site users making a request via the online request form will be required to verify their identity with their User ID. Registered Site users making requests via email will be required to provide additional information relating to their account (e.g., information contained in their account profile) and/or be directed to log into their account in order to verify their identity. For non-registered Site users, the CA Personal Information collected is limited to Other Information (see Section 3). We do not have any reasonable way to verify the identity of a non-registered CA Resident making a right to know specific pieces of information or deletion request with respect to this information.</p>
        <p>The right to request deletion of CA Personal Information does not extend to any personal information contained or displayed within a Posting on the Site, as such postings are the protected free speech of the Site user who made the Posting.</p>
        <p>We do not discriminate or retaliate against any CA Resident for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        <strong>10.5 Authorized Agents.</strong>
        CA Residents may use an authorized agent to submit a request on their behalf provided that the CA Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided. CA Residents or their authorized agents can contact us at <a href="mailto:CCPA@ratemyprofessors.com">CCPA@ratemyprofessors.com</a> for instructions and identity verification requirements for authorized agent requests.

        A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. We provide this notice and choice in Section 7.2 above. This satisfies our obligation to otherwise maintain or furnish users with a list of the names and addresses of third parties who receive Personal Information from us for marketing purposes.

        <strong>10.7 CA Privacy Questions.</strong>

    <strong>11. ADDITIONAL STATE PRIVACY LAWS.</strong>
    Other states, such as Connecticut, Colorado and Virginia, have also enacted privacy laws which provide their residents with various rights regarding their personal information – such as access, correction, deletion and opt out of targeted advertising – in certain circumstances. Please note that given the limited data we collect we are unable to reasonably identify the state of residence of our Site users. However, residents of all states may exercise the opt out rights described in Section 5.2 (Your Choices with Respect to Tracking Technologies).
