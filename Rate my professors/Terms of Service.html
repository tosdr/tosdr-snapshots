    <span>You understand, acknowledge and agree that Postings are the sole responsibility of the person
      from which such Postings originated. This means that you are solely and entirely responsible
      for the consequences of all Postings that you (including, but not limited to, Postings made
      under your name, user name and/or email address) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise
      make available via the Site. Except for the licenses, authorizations, consents and rights

    <span>Postings do not reflect the views of Rate My Professors and Rate My Professors does not represent or guarantee the

      prevent unauthorized content from appearing and being displayed on our Site. Rate My Professors reserves
      the right to review, monitor, edit and/or screen any Postings and to delete, remove, move,
      re-format, edit or reject, without notice to you, any Postings that we deem, in our sole
      discretion, to be in violation of this Agreement or to be unacceptable to Rate My Professors, or for any
      reason or for no reason whatsoever; provided, however, that Rate My Professors shall have no obligation
      or liability for failure to do so or for doing so in any particular manner. If we change your

      we reserve the right, at any time and without limiting any and all other rights we may have
      under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to: (i) refuse to allow you to Post; (ii) remove
      and delete Postings; (iii) revoke your right to use the Site; and/or (iv) use any

      verification records to us, as well as a legible photocopy of your valid driver&#x27;s license,

      will promptly comply with any specific requests or directions we give you in connection with
      Postings you submit that may be subject to these requirements.</span>

    <span>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you also understand and agree that Rate My Professors shall

    <span><strong>19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.</strong></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any Claim informally, then such Claim
      shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.<span>  </span>The arbitration shall
      be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under
      $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) Arbitration Rules and
      Procedures, except as modified herein, including the Optional Appeal Procedure, at the office
      of JAMS at the location set forth in Section 20, or its successor (“JAMS”) in
      effect at the time the request for arbitration is made (the “Arbitration
      Rules”).<span>  </span>If you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send a
      copy of any initiating forms to Rate My Professors, which should be sent to Rate My Professors at the following
      address: 1 State St., New York, NY 10004<span>  </span>Attention: Rate My Professors Inc. General
      Counsel. The parties agree that the costs of the arbitration (excluding attorney’s fees)
      will be shared pro rata to the extent permitted by law, except you agree to reimburse Rate My Professors
      for all fees associated with the arbitration (including attorneys fees) paid by Rate My Professors in the
      event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous
      or vexatious.<span>  </span>The arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral
      arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.<span>  </span>The
      arbitrator shall follow New York substantive law and the Federal Rules of Evidence in
      adjudicating the Dispute.<span>  </span>In all cases, you and Rate My Professors shall exchange
      documents and other information that you or Rate My Professors intend to use in the arbitration.<span>  </span>The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision, which will be part of
      the arbitration award and admissible in any judicial proceeding to confirm, correct or vacate
      the award.<span>  </span>Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator and
      the members of any appeal panel shall be former or retired judges or justices of any New York
      state or federal court with experience in matters involving the industry.<span>  </span>If either party refuses to perform any or all of its obligations under the final arbitration
      award (following appeal, if applicable) within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered,
      then the other party may enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction in New
      York County.<span>  </span>The party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of
      all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in enforcing the
      award, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.<span>  </span>The
      parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award,
      including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the
      arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court
      application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or
      unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</span>

        IN </strong></span><span><strong>SECTION 19.5</strong></span><span><strong>), YOU AND Rate My Professors AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR
        IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
        REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong></span><span> You and Rate My Professors expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and Rate My Professors, shall
      only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to
      Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in </span><span>Section 19.1</span><span> of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class
      action, or any other representative proceeding. The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is
      excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in </span><span>Section 19.1</span><span> of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the
      Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in </span><span>Section 19.1</span><span> of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims and may not
      preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If a court or arbitrator
      determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and
      Rate My Professors, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable. Neither you nor Rate My Professors
      consent to class arbitration.</span>
