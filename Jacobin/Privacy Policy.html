<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ol>
<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
