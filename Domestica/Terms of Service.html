Your notice must contain ALL of the following:<br /><ol><li>Identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed.</li><li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (i.e., URL address).</li><li>Contact information so that we can reach you (address, telephone number and email address).</li><li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li><li>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notification is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.</li></ol><br />Before you file an infringement notice, please carefully consider whether or not the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the "fair use" doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. Please also check to make sure you haven’t authorized the use at issue (for example, whether you have given a creative professional who prepared materials for your company the right to use those materials as examples of his or her past work). If you are unsure whether a use of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. You may also wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at the U.S. Copyright website <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">www.copyright.gov</a> or at the Lumen database website <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/">www.lumendatabase.org</a>.<br />DOMESTIKA will respond to valid DMCA requests in an expeditious manner. In all cases, if you do not hear from us within 14 days of submitting a complaint, please contact us at the <a href="https://support.domestika.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?utm_campaign=terms+and+conditions+form&utm_medium=form&utm_source=terms_page">Web Form</a> and we will respond as soon as possible.<br />After removing access to the material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, DOMESTIKA will immediately notify the user responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. DOMESTIKA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any member who is the subject of repeated DMCA notifications.<br />If you believe access to your content was disabled or removed by DOMESTIKA as a result of an improper copyright infringement notice, please send our Copyright Agent (contact information above) a written counter‐notice that contains all of the following:<br /><ol><li>A description of the work improperly removed, along with your user name and the location in the Site at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled.</li><li>Contact information so that we can reach you (address, telephone number and email address).</li><li>A statement under penalty of perjury, signed by you, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li><li>A statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the Southern  District of New York and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. </li></ol><br />Before you file a counter-notice, please carefully consider whether or not your use of the copyrighted material at issue is infringing, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees in the event that a court decides your counter-notice misrepresented that the material was removed by mistake. <br />If you are unsure whether use of the material at issue constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. In addition, you may wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at the U.S. Copyright website <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">www.copyright.gov</a> or at the Lumen database website <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/">www.lumendatabase.org</a>.<br />Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, DOMESTIKA will forward it to the notifying party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original notifying party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If DOMESTIKA does not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services.<br /><h2>6.

DOMESTIKA reserves the right to remove any link made available by third parties in the Services.<br /><h2>10. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS</h2><br />You warrant that you (as an individual or as a representative of any entity on whose behalf you use the Services) are not located in, or a resident of, any country that is subject to applicable U.S. trade sanctions or embargoes (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or the Crimea region of Ukraine). You also warrant that you are not a person or entity who is named on any U.S. government specially designated national or denied-party list. If you become subject to such a restriction, you will notify us within 24 hours, and we will have the right to terminate any further obligations to you, effective immediately and with no liability to you.<br /><h2>11. FEES</h2><br />DOMESTIKA offers online courses and other Services (such as DOMESTIKA PLUS) for a fee. You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize DOMESTIKA to charge you for the Services with your selected payment method. The fees will be charged whether you use the purchased Services or not. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by DOMESTIKA and any applicable taxes in a timely manner. We reserve the right to disable or remove access to any content for which we have not received adequate payment.<br />Fees may vary based on your location and other factors. If you are logged into your account, the currency you will see is based on your location when you created your account. However, the final fees charged to you will always be calculated in US dollars; therefore the final fees charged to you may vary depending on prevailing currency exchange rates offered by our payment providers. <br />We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content.<br />You shall provide DOMESTIKA information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. Your represent and warrant that (a) such information is true, accurate, current and complete and that you are authorized to use this payment instrument and (b) you shall maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You agree that DOMESTIKA may update your payment methods using information provided to us by our payment service providers and you authorize us to continue to charge the then-applicable fees to your updated payment method.<br />DOMESTIKA reserves the right, at any time, to change any fees or to start charging for any free Service at its sole discretion. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting through the relevant Services (such changes will not apply to fees paid prior to the time of the change). <br />Please note that due to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies, sometimes the price of content offered on DOMESTIKA’s website may not be the same as the price offered on our mobile applications.<br />Additional conditions for DOMESTIKA PLUS are set forth in section 13.<br /><h2>12. REFUNDS</h2><br />Please note that our refund policy differs between one-time payments for courses and DOMESTIKA PLUS (please refer to Section 13 for DOMESTIKA PLUS). However, the following guidelines apply to both: (i) Refunds are not available for accounts which violate this Terms of Use or, according to DOMESTIKA sole and absolute discretion, are otherwise objectionable; (ii) If DOMESTIKA determines that you are abusing our refund policy, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse or restrict any and all current or future use of the Service without delivering a refund.); (iii) To request a refund please contact us through our <a href="https://support.domestika.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?utm_campaign=terms+and+conditions+form&utm_medium=form&utm_source=terms_page">Web Form</a>; (iv) DOMESTIKA will apply your refund to your original payment method; (v) Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to offer partial refunds for your purchases.<br /> 
If within the first 14 days after you purchased a course you become dissatisfied with that course, DOMESTIKA will refund the full amount of your purchase and subsequently terminate your access to that course. Refunds will not be available if requested after this 14-day period. Due to possible currency exchange rate fluctuations with your local currency and the US dollar, the refunded amount may be slightly higher or lower than your original paid amount.<br />In addition to the above, if you purchase a course or purchase any other paid service through a mobile or third party marketplace (e.g., purchases through the Apple or Google Play App Store), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by DOMESTIKA. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by DOMESTIKA, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy and DOMESTIKA will have no refund obligations. DOMESTIKA disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.<br /><h2>13. TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN DOMESTIKA PLUS</h2><br />This section deals with the additional conditions that apply to your participation in the DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system. By using DOMESTIKA PLUS, you agree to the additional terms and conditions in this section.<br /><ul><li><em>DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system:</em> Depending on the recurrence chosen in your recurring purchase system (monthly or yearly), you will receive the corresponding credits (1 credit in case of monthly option; 12 credits in case of yearly option) at the beginning of the period of your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS. The credits will be delivered automatically according to the frequency chosen by you (monthly or yearly) without any further action being necessary and can be redeemed for the next 12 months thereafter. After this period, credits that have not been redeemed will be cancelled. In addition, on an ancillary basis, during your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content included in DOMESTIKA PLUS. The particular DOMESTIKA PLUS plan you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, terms and pricing of that recurring purchase system. Your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS will continue until cancelled. You may not transfer, assign or share credits generated through DOMESTIKA PLUS (or any other benefits of participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS) with any third party.</li></ul><br /><ul><li><em>Fees and payments:</em> The price of the DOMESTIKA PLUS will be indicated at the time of purchase (in the case of the monthly option, such fee will refer to 1 credit and in the case of the annual option, the fee will refer to 12 credits, all this in addition to other ancillary benefits). You shall pay the DOMESTIKA PLUS fee through the payment methods offered by DOMESTIKA. By participating in the DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system, you authorize DOMESTIKA to maintain your account information and to charge your account automatically at the time the next recurring purchase is due without any further action on your part. In the event that DOMESTIKA is unable to charge your account, DOMESTIKA will suspend your access to DOMESTIKA PLUS until payment is received. It is possible that DOMESTIKA may change the price for future recurring purchases. In that case, DOMESTIKA will inform you in writing. Price changes will be effective on the next recurring purchase after the date of such changes. If you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS before the next recurring purchase is generated. Therefore, please be sure to read any price change information carefully.</li></ul><br /><ul><li><em>Cancellation and refunds:</em> Your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS will continue until cancelled. You may cancel your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS through our website at any time before the next recurring purchase is generated (or the end of the free trial period). The cancellation will only take effect at the end of the term associated with your selected recurring purchase system (or at the end of your free trial) and you will continue to have access to the services included in your recurring purchase system until the end of that period. If you cancel your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS before the new recurring purchase is generated, it will not be processed and you will not be charged. However, if the recurring purchase has already been generated, it will not be refunded. In this regard, we will not refund any purchase that has been generated prior to the cancellation of your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS. As you can enjoy our Services immediately after registering in DOMESTIKA PLUS, DOMESTIKA does not offer a 14-day right of withdrawal for DOMESTIKA PLUS. You acknowledge that by registering with DOMESTIKA PLUS, you agree to the immediate provision of digital content and therefore lose your right of withdrawal.</li></ul><br /><h2>14. GIFT CARDS</h2><br />DOMESTIKA or our partners may offer gift cards that can be used to purchase our eligible courses subject to the terms included in your gift card. You must create or have an existing and valid DOMESTIKA account to redeem a gift card.<br />Gift cards offered by DOMESTIKA are not for resale without express written authorization from DOMESTIKA and are not refundable and may not be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent, except as required by law. Gift cards offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s policies.<br />DOMESTIKA is not responsible for any lost or stolen gift cards or use without your permission. We may withdraw or cancel the gift card and require an alternative form of payment if we suspect that the gift card may have been stolen or fraudulently used. Further action may also be taken. The use of gift cards in any manner that states or implies that any person, website, business, product or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, DOMESTIKA is prohibited without DOMESTIKA’s prior written approval. Gift cards are not valid and will not be honored, and DOMESTIKA will not be liable, if obtained from unauthorized sellers, distributors or resellers.<br /><h2>15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2><br />You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the Internet or the Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2><br />TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DOMESTIKA, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.<br />IN NO EVENT WILL DOMESTIKA’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID DOMESTIKA IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).<br />SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.<br /><h2>17. INDEMNIFICATION</h2><br />You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless DOMESTIKA, its affiliates, licensors and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Service’s content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use, or your use of any information obtained from the Service.<br /><h2>18. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2><br />All matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction).<br />Subject to Section 19, any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the Southern District of New York or the courts of the State of New York, in each case located in the County of New York, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.<br /><h2>19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2><br /><em>Generally.</em> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DOMESTIKA in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DOMESTIKA agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Site or the Services or the purchase, receipt, order or use any of any course will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong><br /><em>Exceptions.</em> Despite the provisions of the Section entitled "Generally" directly above, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (b) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (c) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br /><em>Arbitrator.</em> Any arbitration between you and DOMESTIKA will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br /><em>Notice; Process.</em> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or electronic mail ("Notice"). DOMESTIKA’s address for Notice is: 2001 Addison St., Suite 300, Berkeley, CA 94704 or <a href="mailto:legal@domestika.org">legal@domestika.org</a>. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DOMESTIKA may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DOMESTIKA must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. <br /><em>No Class Actions.</em> YOU AND DOMESTIKA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DOMESTIKA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br /><em>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</em> If DOMESTIKA makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DOMESTIKA’s address for notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DOMESTIKA’s address for notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and DOMESTIKA.<br /><h2>20. LIMITATION ON TIME TO FILE CLAIMS</h2><br />ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.<br /><h2>21. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</h2><br />No waiver of by DOMESTIKA of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of DOMESTIKA to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br />If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.<br /><h2>22. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES AND ASSIGNMENT</h2><br />You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Terms of Use, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.<br />You may not assign this Terms of Use without the prior written consent of DOMESTIKA, but DOMESTIKA may assign or transfer this Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction.<br /><h2>23. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2><br />The Terms of Use constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and DOMESTIKA with respect to the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Services.<br /><h2>24. TIME USAGE</h2><br />Unless expressly stated otherwise, in order to maintain a global standard and ensure consistency in our services, all deadlines and times reported by DOMESTIKA are based on UTC time.<br /><h2>25. LANGUAGE</h2><br />Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.<br /><h2>26. YOUR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS</h2><br />Please send any feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and any other communications relating to the Services to us through our <a

COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS AND COUNTER-NOTICES\n\nDOMESTIKA respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. We have adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement related to  the Services in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (*\"DMCA\"*).\n\nIf you believe in good faith the Site is hosting content that infringes your copyright, please let us know by submitting a notice to our Copyright Agent via email at [copyright@domestika.org](mailto:copyright@domestika.org) or in writing to Copyright Agent, 2001 Addison St. Suite 300 Berkeley, CA 94704). Your notice must contain ALL of the following:\n\n1. Identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed.\n1. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (i.e., URL address).\n1. Contact information so that we can reach you (address, telephone number and email address).\n1. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\n1. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notification is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.\n\nBefore you file an infringement notice, please carefully consider whether or not the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the \"fair use\" doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. Please also check to make sure you haven’t authorized the use at issue (for example, whether you have given a creative professional who prepared materials for your company the right to use those materials as examples of his or her past work). If you are unsure whether a use of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. You may also wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at the U.S. Copyright website [www.copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/) or at the Lumen database website [www.lumendatabase.org](https://www.lumendatabase.org/).\n\nDOMESTIKA will respond to valid DMCA requests in an expeditious manner. In all cases, if you do not hear from us within 14 days of submitting a complaint, please contact us at the [Web Form](https://support.domestika.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?utm_campaign=terms+and+conditions+form\u0026utm_medium=form\u0026utm_source=terms_page) and we will respond as soon as possible.\n\nAfter removing access to the material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, DOMESTIKA will immediately notify the user responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. DOMESTIKA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any member who is the subject of repeated DMCA notifications.\n\nIf you believe access to your content was disabled or removed by DOMESTIKA as a result of an improper copyright infringement notice, please send our Copyright Agent (contact information above) a written counter‐notice that contains all of the following:\n\n1. A description of the work improperly removed, along with your user name and the location in the Site at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled.\n1. Contact information so that we can reach you (address, telephone number and email address).\n1. A statement under penalty of perjury, signed by you, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.\n1. A statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the Southern  District of New York and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. \n\nBefore you file a counter-notice, please carefully consider whether or not your use of the copyrighted material at issue is infringing, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees in the event that a court decides your counter-notice misrepresented that the material was removed by mistake. \n\nIf you are unsure whether use of the material at issue constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. In addition, you may wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at the U.S. Copyright website [www.copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/) or at the Lumen database website [www.lumendatabase.org](https://www.lumendatabase.org/).\n\nUpon receipt of a valid counter-notification, DOMESTIKA will forward it to the notifying party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original notifying party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If DOMESTIKA does not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e6. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT; TERMINATION\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nDOMESTIKA has the right to:\n\n* Remove any User Contributions or Submissions for any or no reason, in our sole discretion.\n* Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public or could create any liability for DOMESTIKA.\n* Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.\n* Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Services.\n* Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason, including without limitation, (i) any violation of these Terms of Use, (ii) if you fail to pay any fees that you owe, (iii) if you file or submit fraudulent chargebacks requests, (iv) if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, or (v) for any other reason in our reasonable sole discretion.\n\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that DOMESTIKA may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or ban any further access to such files or the Service.

We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e7. RELIANCE ON INFORMATION POSTED\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nThe information presented on or through the Services is made available solely for general information purposes.

LINKING TO THE SERVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nYou may link to our homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part without our express written consent.\n\nThe Services may provide certain social media features that enable you to:\n\n* Link from your own or certain third-party websites to certain content on this Site.\n* Send e-mails or other communications with certain content, or links to certain content, on this Site.\n* Cause limited portions of content on this Site to be displayed or appear to be displayed on your own or certain third-party websites.\n\nYou may use these features solely as they are provided by us and solely with respect to the content they are displayed with.

As such, DOMESTIKA is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such social media services. DOMESTIKA enables these features merely as a convenience and the integration or inclusion of such features does not imply an endorsement or recommendation.\n\nYou agree to immediately cooperate with us to cease any unauthorized framing or linking. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.\n\nWe may disable all or any social media features and any links at any time without notice in our sole discretion.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e9. LINKS FROM THE SERVICES\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nIf we or third parties provide links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. This may include links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third party websites linked from the Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites. DOMESTIKA reserves the right to remove any link made available by third parties in the Services.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e10. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nYou warrant that you (as an individual or as a representative of any entity on whose behalf you use the Services) are not located in, or a resident of, any country that is subject to applicable U.S. trade sanctions or embargoes (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or the Crimea region of Ukraine). You also warrant that you are not a person or entity who is named on any U.S. government specially designated national or denied-party list. If you become subject to such a restriction, you will notify us within 24 hours, and we will have the right to terminate any further obligations to you, effective immediately and with no liability to you.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e11. FEES\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nDOMESTIKA offers online courses and other Services (such as DOMESTIKA PLUS) for a fee. You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize DOMESTIKA to charge you for the Services with your selected payment method. The fees will be charged whether you use the purchased Services or not. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by DOMESTIKA and any applicable taxes in a timely manner. We reserve the right to disable or remove access to any content for which we have not received adequate payment.\n\nFees may vary based on your location and other factors. If you are logged into your account, the currency you will see is based on your location when you created your account. However, the final fees charged to you will always be calculated in US dollars; therefore the final fees charged to you may vary depending on prevailing currency exchange rates offered by our payment providers. \n\nWe occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content.\n\nYou shall provide DOMESTIKA information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. Your represent and warrant that (a) such information is true, accurate, current and complete and that you are authorized to use this payment instrument and (b) you shall maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You agree that DOMESTIKA may update your payment methods using information provided to us by our payment service providers and you authorize us to continue to charge the then-applicable fees to your updated payment method.\n\nDOMESTIKA reserves the right, at any time, to change any fees or to start charging for any free Service at its sole discretion. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting through the relevant Services (such changes will not apply to fees paid prior to the time of the change). \n\nPlease note that due to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies, sometimes the price of content offered on DOMESTIKA’s website may not be the same as the price offered on our mobile applications.\n\nAdditional conditions for DOMESTIKA PLUS are set forth in section 13.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e12. REFUNDS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nPlease note that our refund policy differs between one-time payments for courses and DOMESTIKA PLUS (please refer to Section 13 for DOMESTIKA PLUS). However, the following guidelines apply to both: (i) Refunds are not available for accounts which violate this Terms of Use or, according to DOMESTIKA sole and absolute discretion, are otherwise objectionable; (ii) If DOMESTIKA determines that you are abusing our refund policy, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse or restrict any and all current or future use of the Service without delivering a refund.); (iii) To request a refund please contact us through our [Web Form](https://support.domestika.org/hc/en-us/requests/new?utm_campaign=terms+and+conditions+form\u0026utm_medium=form\u0026utm_source=terms_page); (iv) DOMESTIKA will apply your refund to your original payment method; (v) Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to offer partial refunds for your purchases.\n\n \nIf within the first 14 days after you purchased a course you become dissatisfied with that course, DOMESTIKA will refund the full amount of your purchase and subsequently terminate your access to that course. Refunds will not be available if requested after this 14-day period. Due to possible currency exchange rate fluctuations with your local currency and the US dollar, the refunded amount may be slightly higher or lower than your original paid amount.\n\nIn addition to the above, if you purchase a course or purchase any other paid service through a mobile or third party marketplace (e.g., purchases through the Apple or Google Play App Store), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by DOMESTIKA. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by DOMESTIKA, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy and DOMESTIKA will have no refund obligations. DOMESTIKA disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e13. TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN DOMESTIKA PLUS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nThis section deals with the additional conditions that apply to your participation in the DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system. By using DOMESTIKA PLUS, you agree to the additional terms and conditions in this section.\n\n* *DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system:* Depending on the recurrence chosen in your recurring purchase system (monthly or yearly), you will receive the corresponding credits (1 credit in case of monthly option; 12 credits in case of yearly option) at the beginning of the period of your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS. The credits will be delivered automatically according to the frequency chosen by you (monthly or yearly) without any further action being necessary and can be redeemed for the next 12 months thereafter. After this period, credits that have not been redeemed will be cancelled. In addition, on an ancillary basis, during your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content included in DOMESTIKA PLUS. The particular DOMESTIKA PLUS plan you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, terms and pricing of that recurring purchase system. Your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS will continue until cancelled. You may not transfer, assign or share credits generated through DOMESTIKA PLUS (or any other benefits of participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS) with any third party.\n\n* *Fees and payments:* The price of the DOMESTIKA PLUS will be indicated at the time of purchase (in the case of the monthly option, such fee will refer to 1 credit and in the case of the annual option, the fee will refer to 12 credits, all this in addition to other ancillary benefits). You shall pay the DOMESTIKA PLUS fee through the payment methods offered by DOMESTIKA. By participating in the DOMESTIKA PLUS recurring purchase system, you authorize DOMESTIKA to maintain your account information and to charge your account automatically at the time the next recurring purchase is due without any further action on your part. In the event that DOMESTIKA is unable to charge your account, DOMESTIKA will suspend your access to DOMESTIKA PLUS until payment is received. It is possible that DOMESTIKA may change the price for future recurring purchases. In that case, DOMESTIKA will inform you in writing. Price changes will be effective on the next recurring purchase after the date of such changes. If you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS before the next recurring purchase is generated. Therefore, please be sure to read any price change information carefully.\n\n* *Cancellation and refunds:* Your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS will continue until cancelled. You may cancel your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS through our website at any time before the next recurring purchase is generated (or the end of the free trial period). The cancellation will only take effect at the end of the term associated with your selected recurring purchase system (or at the end of your free trial) and you will continue to have access to the services included in your recurring purchase system until the end of that period. If you cancel your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS before the new recurring purchase is generated, it will not be processed and you will not be charged. However, if the recurring purchase has already been generated, it will not be refunded. In this regard, we will not refund any purchase that has been generated prior to the cancellation of your participation in DOMESTIKA PLUS. As you can enjoy our Services immediately after registering in DOMESTIKA PLUS, DOMESTIKA does not offer a 14-day right of withdrawal for DOMESTIKA PLUS. You acknowledge that by registering with DOMESTIKA PLUS, you agree to the immediate provision of digital content and therefore lose your right of withdrawal.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e14. GIFT CARDS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nDOMESTIKA or our partners may offer gift cards that can be used to purchase our eligible courses subject to the terms included in your gift card. You must create or have an existing and valid DOMESTIKA account to redeem a gift card.\n\nGift cards offered by DOMESTIKA are not for resale without express written authorization from DOMESTIKA and are not refundable and may not be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent, except as required by law. Gift cards offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s policies.\n\nDOMESTIKA is not responsible for any lost or stolen gift cards or use without your permission. We may withdraw or cancel the gift card and require an alternative form of payment if we suspect that the gift card may have been stolen or fraudulently used. Further action may also be taken. The use of gift cards in any manner that states or implies that any person, website, business, product or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, DOMESTIKA is prohibited without DOMESTIKA’s prior written approval. Gift cards are not valid and will not be honored, and DOMESTIKA will not be liable, if obtained from unauthorized sellers, distributors or resellers.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nYou understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the Internet or the Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, VIRUSES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES OR TO YOUR DOWNLOADING OF ANY MATERIAL POSTED ON IT, OR ON ANY WEBSITE LINKED TO IT.\n\nYOUR USE OF THE SITE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DOMESTIKA, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.\n\nIN NO EVENT WILL DOMESTIKA’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID DOMESTIKA IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e17. INDEMNIFICATION\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless DOMESTIKA, its affiliates, licensors and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Service’s content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use, or your use of any information obtained from the Service.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e18. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nAll matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction).\n\nSubject to Section 19, any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the Southern District of New York or the courts of the State of New York, in each case located in the County of New York, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.\n\n\u003ch2\u003e19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n*Generally.* In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DOMESTIKA in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DOMESTIKA agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Site or the Services or the purchase, receipt, order or use any of any course will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**\n\n*Exceptions.* Despite the provisions of the Section entitled \"Generally\" directly above, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (b) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (c) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\n*Arbitrator.* Any arbitration between you and DOMESTIKA will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n\n*Notice; Process.* A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or electronic mail (\"Notice\"). DOMESTIKA’s address for Notice is: 2001 Addison St., Suite 300, Berkeley, CA 94704 or [legal@domestika.org](mailto:legal@domestika.org). The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DOMESTIKA may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DOMESTIKA must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. \n\n*No Class Actions.* YOU AND DOMESTIKA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
