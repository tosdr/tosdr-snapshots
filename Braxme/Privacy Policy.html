                    <strong>Your Privacy</strong> <br /><br />
                    We place extraordinary importance to your privacy and protecting it while you use our app. As part
                    of our desire to provide security for your data, we also need to be confident of your 
                    identity so that your contacts and friends know to whom they are talking to.
                    
                        <br /><br />                    
                    <strong>What information do we collect?</strong> <br /><br />
                    During signup, we collect your name. It is not required that you
                    give your real name, however it may be difficult for you to be identified by your friends if you
                    don't provide some name they will recognize. You can always change this at any time. 
                        <br /><br />                    
                    We optionally ask you to enter an email address. You must have access to this email address. 
                    We will verify it for your protection. The email address is primarily used for password recovery.
                        <br /><br />                    
                    You use a @username for people to use to contact you on the app without using any other identifier.
                        <br /><br />                    
                    We ask for an optional mobile phone to send you SMS (text) messages. This is solely used for password recovery.
                        <br /><br />                    
                    We do not store your password directly (we use something called an irreversible hash). This means that we 
                    cannot see your password or log in to your account without your knowledge. 
                    We are also unable to change your passwords 
                    for you.
                        <br /><br />                    
                    We do not extract or store EXIF data from your photos in My Photos other than to read the orientation of the photo. We 
                    then strip out the EXIF data upon storage. We do not read EXIF data of photo files in My Files. It is encrypted directly.
                        <br /><br />                    
                    We do not track anything in cookies. We do not track your location or your IP address. 
                    Your device retains an encrypted form of your login information for quick access to the app when you are 
                    logged in. This login information is removed when you log out.
                        <br /><br />         
                    If you click on an external link posted by other users, other websites may create cookies that track you. 
                    Note that those links mean you have left this app.
                        <br /><br />         
                    If we detect an attack on our servers (such as setting up multiple accounts, or denial of service attempts), 
                    we reserve the right to begin fingerprinting you to lock access to the app.
                        <br /><br />                    
                        
                        <strong>We Do Not Share your Info</strong> 
                        <br /><br />     
                        
                    We do not sell, exchange, or transfer your email address, or SMS number to other companies without your express
                    permission. We will contact you via email only in relation to this app (such as messages and alerts).
                        <br /><br />     
                    We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII). There are no "profiles" on you. You 
                    are free to reveal information to those you are communicating with on your own. We do not provide 
                    information on your actions to any outside party or track you for the purpose of advertising.
                        <br /><br />     
                        <strong>Confidentiality of Your Data</strong> 
                        <br /><br />   
                    We take extraordinary precautions to ensure that your data remains private. Even with a 
                    security breach, your data is resistant to hacking both from external or internal players.
                        <br /><br />   
                    When you send messages and create posts, be assured that your content is kept in non-human readable 
                    form. It is also designed to be unreadable to us. Your private data is always encrypted whether in 
                    storage or in transit. Note that there are public areas in Brax.Me and those are readable 
                    and open, although the identity of the posters can be aliased or anonymous. Open Membership areas are clearly 
                    labeled.

                    <strong>HIPAA Compliant (USA)</strong> <br /><br />
                    Except for Open Membership Rooms, all features of this app are HIPAA compliant (ensuring privacy of Medical information). 
                    Because our company is not able to see your private content, there is no necessity for 
                    a Business Associate Agreement but we will sign the agreement if asked to do so. This 
                    app is safe for use in provider-to-provider and provider-patient communications.
