    <p>These Terms of Use (the "Terms") together with our Privacy Policy form a binding contract ("Agreement") between you and Next Admit, LLC ("Next Admit," "we," "our," and "us"). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all terms and conditions of the Agreement which will remain in effect while you use the Services.</p>
    <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, THESE TERMS REQUIRE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH USE OF AN ARBITRATION SERVICE.

    <p class="subheader">2. Modification.</p>
    <p>Next Admit reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify these Terms at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will either post a notification of the modification on our website or otherwise provide you with notice of the change. The date of the last modification will also be posted at the beginning of these Terms. It is your responsibility to check from time to time for updates. By continuing to access or use the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by any modified Terms.</p>
    <p class="subheader">3. Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy <a href="/privacy-policy">here</a> discusses how we collect, process, and disclose personal information through your use of our Services. Please read that policy carefully.</p>
    <p class="subheader">4. Eligibility.</p>
    <p>Our Services are intended for the use of adults over 18 years older and children over the age of 13. If you are aged 13 years or younger, you may not download or use our Services or access or provide any User Content. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you may use our Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian agreeing to these Terms for the benefit of a child who is 13 or older but under the age of 18, you are fully responsible for his or her use of the Services.</p>
    <p class="subheader">5. Acceptable Use.</p>
    <p>Next Admit hereby grants you permission to use the Services and, if you are a registered user, permission to access and use those aspects of the Services that are offered to registered users, provided such use is in compliance with these Terms, and you further specifically agree that your use will adhere to the following restrictions and obligations:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>You may only use the Services for personal use.</li>
        <li>You may only use the Services for lawful activity. It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. In addition, you may not use the Services in any manner that is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
        <li>You may not interfere with or damage the Services, including, without limitation, through the use of viruses, bots, harmful code, denial-of-service attacks, backdoors, packet or IP address spoofing, forged routing, or any similar methods or technology;</li>
        <li>You shall not copy, rip, or capture any content encountered on the Services. This includes bulk copying or "scraping" any portion of the website content using a bot or other tool;</li>
        <li>You may not use the Services to upload, transmit, or promote any material that constitutes junk mail, spam, or commercial offers;</li>
        <li>You may not use the Services to upload, transmit, or promote any material that infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Next Admit);</li>
        <li>You may not decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>
    <p class="subheader">6. User Accounts.</p>
    <p>You must sign up for an account using your own email address on this website in order to use certain of the website functions. If you just want to browse the website, registration is optional. You can select any username you like for your account, except that your username cannot be an impersonation of another person, a term that is the same or confusingly similar to a famous trademark, or a term that is offensive in any way. You may, but are not obligated to, use your own name.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or legal guardian, you may link or have your account linked to your child’s account.</p>
    <p>If you would like us to terminate your account, please contact us at support@nextadmit.com. Upon receipt of your request, and except as set forth below, we will remove your account and your associated information from the Services within a reasonable time period. Please note that any information you have submitted to publicly accessible areas of the Services may not be removeable. If we intend to remove your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our removal of your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Content you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Next Admit.</p>
    <p>You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission, which we may grant or deny in our sole and absolute discretion. You agree you shall not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account and any losses or damages that may be incurred.</p>
    <p>You may also be allowed to create a Next Admit account by logging into your account with certain third- party platforms ("Third Party Information Providers" including, but not limited to, Facebook). You may link your Next Admit account with a Third Party Information Provider by either: (i) providing your Third Party Information Provider account login information to us through the Services; or (ii) allowing us to access your Third Party Information Provider. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE THIRD PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS ARE GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, AND THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL DETERMINE WHAT INFORMATION WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND USE THROUGH THOSE THIRD PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS. Your Next Admit account will be created for your use of the Services based on the personal information you provide us or that we obtain via a Third Party Information Provider.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your mobile device, computer, or other device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or your account, or any other breach of security of which you become aware.</p>
    <p>By setting up your account and using our services, you expressly agree that you will receive communications from us, including email messages. You acknowledge and agree that you consent to the receipt of such messages and that your receipt of such messages does not violate the CAN-SPAM Act and/or any state and federal laws related to commercial communications. You may stop receiving such messages by following the opt-out instructions provided by us in any such communication or notifying us by email that you no longer wish to receive messages from us.</p>
    <p class="subheader">7. Content.</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p><b>Next Admit Content.</b> The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, and illustrations (all of the foregoing except User Content, the "Next Admit Content"), are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws./or other intellectual property laws.</p>

In addition, to the extent that Next Admit de-identifies and aggregates any User Content, you agree that such derived data is no longer User Content, and is thus owned by Next Admit.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all User Content. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to Next Admit the license above.
