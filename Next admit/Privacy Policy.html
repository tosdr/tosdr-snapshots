<div class="privacy-policy container paragraphs">
    <p>Effective Date: March 2, 2023</p>
    <p class="subheader">1. Introduction.</p>

    <p class="subheader">2. Information We May Collect.</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p><b>Voluntarily disclosed information.</b> Voluntarily disclosed information. You agree that we may collect the following information about you: Name, contact information, including email address, phone number, age, gender, IP (Internet Protocol) address, information supplied during the processing of registering with us, data usage trends, data showing the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, browser information, demographic information, browsing preferences, browsing data, the type of device being used, website usage information, information regarding any URLs used with the Services, data regarding use of our Services, other information relevant to surveys and/or offers, and any other information we are legally allowed to collect.</p>
            <p>When you use the Services, you will have the opportunity to provide us with some information directly. For example, some functions of the Services require you to register for an account, where we may ask you for your name, email address and phone number. As another example, we may also collect other information you directly give us as you build your profile through the Services, including but not limited to your, demographic information, GPA, test scores, race/ethnicity, academic awards and any other information that appears on a college application, including but not limited to, the common application, the coalition application, individual school applications, and supplemental materials ("College Application").</p>
            <p>If you opt to use our College Application review as part of our Services, users may redact or omit any piece of Information they do not wish to share with us or for us to collect. IN ANY EVENT, ALL USERS ARE REQUIRED TO REDACT OR OMIT THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IN ORDER TO USE OUR SERVICES.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Automatically collected information.</b> Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, "cookie" information, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
            <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services.</p>
            <p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Heat Map and Tracking Software.</b> We may use various types of tracking software ("Tracking Software") to track mouse movement, scrolling, time spent on a page/screen, pages/screens visited, and clicks in order to better understand our users' needs and to optimize the use of our Services. The most common form of Tracking Software is referred to as a "heat map" and the forms of heat maps include scroll maps, click maps, and movement maps. Heat maps are graphical representations of data where values are depicted by color. Users hereby specifically agree to our use of Tracking Software and heat maps.</p>
            <p>Our Tracking Software may capture screen shots of users' mouse movements, scrolling, and clicking habits which helps us understand what users want, care about, and do when using our Services by visually representing their clicks, taps and scrolling behavior. Some of the reasons why we use heat map software are as follows: to see if Users are reaching important content or failing to see it, to find and use a page's main links, buttons, opt-ins, and calls to action ("CTAs"), to see if users are getting distracted by non-clickable elements, and to compare usage against mobile, tablet and desktop devices.</p>
            <p>We use Tracking Software to help us better understand our users' experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what Users do and don't like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our Services with user feedback. This Traffic Software uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users' behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your website visit and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our content. This Tracking Software stores this information on our behalf.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Website and Application Analytics.</b> We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners, including but not limited to, Google Analytics to collect information about how you interact with our website, including what pages you visit, what site you visited prior to visiting our website, how much time you spend on each page, what operating system and web browser you use and network and IP information. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our website and Services. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. We use the information provided by these tools to improve our Services. These tools place persistent cookies in Your browser to identify You as a unique user the next time you visit our Website. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider (example: Google for Google Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside. Though information collected does not include personal data such as name, address, billing information, etc., the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies. You can control the technologies we use by utilizing settings in your browser or third-party tools. You can opt-out of making Your activity available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: https://policies.google.com/privacy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Targeted Advertisements.</b> Targeted ads or interest-based offers may be presented to you based on your activities on our website. These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing. We may also partner with third parties to manage our advertising on our webpages. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about such activities in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests, and to measure advertising effectiveness.
