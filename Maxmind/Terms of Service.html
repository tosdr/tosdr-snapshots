    DEFINITIONS.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        "GeoIP Databases" refers to MaxMind's line of database services and
        products that provide geographic information and other data associated
        with specific Internet protocol addresses (each a "GeoIP Database" and
        collectively the "GeoIP Databases"). The data available through the
        GeoIP Databases is referred to in this Agreement as the "GeoIP Data".
      </li>
      <li>
        "minFraud Service" refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses
        MaxMind proprietary data combined with recognized fraud risks to help
        merchants identify potentially fraudulent online transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        "GeoIP2 Web Service" refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses
        MaxMind proprietary data to provide geolocation and other information
        associated with an IP address.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Services" as used in this Agreement encompasses the GeoIP Databases and
        the GeoIP Data therein, the minFraud Services and the GeoIP2 web
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Web Services" refers to the minFraud Service and the GeoIP2 Web
        Service. The GeoIP Databases are not "Web Services." Unless otherwise
        specified, all references to the Services in this Agreement include the
        Web Services.
      </li>
      <li class="anchor-target" id="geolocation-functionality">
        "Geolocation Functionality" includes, but is not limited to, the
        distribution of content based on geographic location, any ability to
        view the GeoIP Data, any ability to view or access graphical or textual
        representations of the GeoIP data, and any ability to initiate queries
        to the GeoIP Databases directly or via your commercial product/service.
      </li>
      <li>
        a "ShopID" is an input for a query to the minFraud Service. The ShopID
        is your internal identification code or name for the shop, affiliate,
        merchant, or customer that is the source of the online transaction for
        which the minFraud Service is being queried.
      </li>
      <li class="anchor-target" id="internal-restricted-business-purposes">
        "Internal Restricted Business Purpose(s)" means the uses of the GeoIP
        Data solely for content customization, fraud prevention, and geographic
        reporting provided that "Internal Restricted Business Purposes" does not
        include:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            providing Geolocation Functionality to applications or online
            platforms if users other than you can access or use the Geolocation
            Functionality for their own purposes or benefit (e.g., you may use
            Geolocation Functionality to customize and target your own ads for
            your own products and services, surveys, and other content but may
            not use Geolocation Functionality in connection with a service that
            customizes or targets any content on behalf of your customers,
            users, or any third party);
          </li>
          <li>
            using GeoIP Data in the models or decision-making process for a
            fraud-detection or similar service offered to third parties,
            regardless of whether end users of the service and other third
            parties are able to view or otherwise access the GeoIP Data;
          </li>
          <li>
            sharing the GeoIP Data with third parties. As an illustration,
            restrictions on sharing GeoIP Data include, but are not limited to,
            (X) displaying geolocation pairing information (meaning displaying
            an IP address along with its geographic origination such as "this IP
            address, XXX.XX.XX.XX, originates from New York City, NY, USA"); and
            (Y) displaying GeoIP Data in an aggregated format such as "1000 IP
            addresses originated in New York City" or
          </li>
          <li>
            using the GeoIP2 Anonymous IP Database or the GeoIP Data therein for
            any purpose unrelated to detecting security incidents or protecting
            against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.

        <u>Disclosure of GeoIP Database and GeoIP Data.</u> you will not
        disclose the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to any third party except as
        explicitly permitted by this Agreement or after notifying MaxMind of the
        anticipated disclosure and obtaining MaxMind's prior written consent to
        the disclosure. To the extent you disclose the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP
        Data to a third party as permitted by this Agreement, you will impose
        upon the third party the same or substantially similar contractual
        duties imposed on you and the rights provided to MaxMind as in this
        Agreement, including those in Section 3 (Limited Grant Of Rights),
        Section 4 (Restrictions), and the Addendum. You are responsible for the
        acts or omissions of any third parties with which you share the GeoIP
        Databases or GeoIP Data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Destruction of GeoIP Database and GeoIP Data.</u> From time to time,
        MaxMind will release an updated version of the GeoIP Databases, and you
        agree to promptly use the updated version of the GeoIP Databases. You
        shall cease use of and destroy (i) any old versions of the GeoIP
        Databases and GeoIP Data within thirty (30) days following the release
        of the updated GeoIP Databases; and (ii) all GeoIP Databases and GeoIP
        Data immediately upon termination of the license under this Agreement.
        Upon request, you shall provide MaxMind with written confirmation of
        such destruction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>FCRA</u> In addition, the parties understand and agree that MaxMind
        is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit
        Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. &#x00a7;1681 et seq. ("FCRA"), and that the
        Services do not constitute "consumer reports" as defined in the FCRA.
        You understand that any information you provide to MaxMind in order to
        use the Services has not been collected by MaxMind for credit purposes
        and is not intended to be indicative of any consumer's credit
        worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or other characteristics
        listed in Section 603(d) of the FCRA. You agree that you will not use
        the Services or any information received through the Services in whole
        or in part (i) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for
        credit, (ii) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for
        insurance, (iii) for employment purposes, (iv) in connection with a
        determination of an individual's eligibility for a license or other
        benefit granted by a governmental authority, or (v) in connection with
        any permissible purpose as defined by the FCRA. Any use of the Services
        by you in violation of this paragraph shall also constitute an
        unacceptable use.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    ACCURACY EXPECTATION: NO USE OF THE GEOIP DATA OR GEOIP2 WEB SERVICES FOR
    IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS OR INDIVIDUALS.
    <p>
      Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond its
      control, MaxMind cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the
      Services. The GeoIP Databases and GeoIP2 web services contain only the
      geographic data available and the availability of such data is not
      consistent for all regions. Furthermore, none of the Services reliably
      identifies any geographic level or division more precise than the zip code
      or postal code associated with an IP address. Accordingly, it is
      imperative that MaxMind's customers not rely on the GeoIP Data or GeoIP2
      web services to identify a specific household, individual, or street
      address. You acknowledge the foregoing limitation of the Services and you
      will not use or encourage others to use the Services for the purpose of
      identifying or locating a specific household, individual, or street
      address.

    NON-DISCLOSURE OF MINFRAUD SERVICE OUTPUTS.
    <p>
      Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, you may not, nor may you
      permit others to, disclose to any customer or other third party any output
      returned by the minFraud Service (e.g., such response values as the
      riskScore, proxyScore or proxy score, IP Risk Score, risk factor scores,
      high risk flags), recognizing that the confidentiality of such information
      is vital to the performance of the minFraud service. Disclosure of such
      information shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement. For
      the removal of doubt, you may provide outputs returned by the minFraud
      Service to customers to whom you have sublicensed the minFraud Service,
      but you may not provide any minFraud Service outputs to any individual
      whose transaction was evaluated by the minFraud Service.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that MaxMind's trade secrets include the
      Services. You further acknowledge and agree that (a) all intellectual
      property rights including copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade
      secrets, and proprietary rights to the Services are exclusively owned by
      MaxMind and (b) you obtain no right, title, or interest therein. You
      hereby assign to MaxMind all copyrights, intellectual property rights, and
      any other proprietary or property rights or interests in and to any work
      created in violation of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      MaxMind's successful maintenance and operation of the Services require
      that it store, retain, and utilize data that is submitted to it by
      customers who use the Services. Accordingly, and to the extent that any
      data submitted to MaxMind by you is protectable by copyright, moral
      rights, or any similar intellectual property laws in any jurisdiction, you
      hereby assign and agree to assign to MaxMind all right, title, and
      interest in and to such data and/or the aggregated product of such data.
      To the extent that you are legally or contractually unable to assign the
      foregoing rights of ownership, then you hereby grant to MaxMind a fully
      paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, copy,
      distribute, make derivative works, and otherwise commercially exploit all
      such data in connection with MaxMind's business. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, MaxMind shall comply with the terms of its own Privacy Policy
      in place at the time of submission of any data to MaxMind.

    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        "Confidential Information" includes all confidential and proprietary
        information or material disclosed by you or MaxMind (the "Disclosing
        Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party") from which the
        Disclosing Party derives actual or potential economic value, and which
        is clearly marked or verbally identified at the time of disclosure as
        "Confidential" or is disclosed or learned under circumstances that would
        lead a reasonable person to conclude that the information was
        confidential. Confidential Information shall not include information
        that: (i) is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the
        Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession
        before being disclosed to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party;
        (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by any other third
        party not bound by any confidentiality obligation with respect to such
        information; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party.
      </li>
      <li>
        The parties acknowledge that each party may have access to Confidential
        Information of the other party. Each party shall use reasonable care to
        protect the Confidential Information of the other party. In that regard,
        each party shall restrict access to Confidential Information to
        employees, contractors, and third parties as is reasonably required to
        exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and
        only if such persons are subject to nondisclosure restrictions at least
        as protective as those set forth in this Agreement. Neither party shall,
        without prior written approval of the other party, use for such party's
        own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit
        the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of the
        Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may
        disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required to
        do so under applicable law, rule or order, provided that the Receiving
        Party discloses no more Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
        than is reasonably necessary in order to respond to the required
        disclosure, and provided further that where reasonably practicable and
        to the extent legally permissible, you will provide MaxMind with prior
        written notice of any required disclosure so that MaxMind may seek a
        protective order or other appropriate remedy.

    PERSONAL DATA.
    <p>
      The parties hereby agree to and incorporate by reference the Addendum,
      which shall apply to the extent the parties process any Personal
      Information (as defined in the Addendum) in connection with your use of
      the Services. The provisions of the Addendum relating to the processing of
      Personal Information (as defined in the Addendum) shall control over any
      conflicting provisions elsewhere in this Agreement. For the removal of
      doubt, the Addendum is subject to the limitations of liability set forth
      in this Agreement.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    SECURITY.
    <p>
      You will maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational
      measures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and
      integrity of any information you receive from MaxMind including without
      limitation, from the Services (including protection against unauthorized
      or unlawful processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction,
      loss, or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,
      such data). In the event you discover a data incident involving any such
      information, you shall promptly notify MaxMind and fully cooperate with
      MaxMind, at your own expense, in remediating the incident. You are
      responsible for all activities that occur under your password, license
      key, and similar mechanisms for account access (collectively "Passwords"),
      and shall keep your Passwords confidential.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    INDEMNIFICATION.
    <p>
      You will indemnify and hold MaxMind and its affiliates harmless from and
      against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, penalties,
      costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred by
      MaxMind or any affiliate thereof as a result of your breach of any of the
      terms of this Agreement, including the Addendum.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    FEES.
    <p>
      MaxMind's current fee schedule for using the Services is posted on the
      Website. Unless MaxMind has agreed in writing to alternative fees for your
      account, the fees posted on the Website shall apply to your use of the
      Services. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your use
      of the Services. Unless MaxMind implements special billing arrangements
      for your account, payment for all services is due in advance.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACES (APIs)
    <p>
      MaxMind may facilitate your access to certain application program
      interfaces ("APIs") for use with the Services. Some APIs may have been
      developed by third parties. MaxMind and you acknowledge that the APIs are
      not Services as defined in this Agreement and that MaxMind does not
      provide any warranties for the APIs. Any copying, implementation, or other
      use of any APIs provided to you by MaxMind is subject to the license terms
      distributed with such APIs or their associated software or documentation.

  <li>
    CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT/TERMINATION.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        MaxMind may amend this Agreement at any time. Any such amendment(s)
        shall be binding and effective upon the earlier of (i) the date that is
        thirty (30) days after the posting of the amended Agreement on the
        Website or (ii) the date that MaxMind provides notice to you of the
        amended Agreement, except that changes to charges and payment terms may
        be made only upon 30 days' prior written notice to you. You may
        immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to MaxMind if a
        change is unacceptable to you. Your continued use of the Services
        following notice to you of a change shall constitute your acceptance of
        the change.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you find it convenient to employ your standard form(s) of purchase
        order or similar form in administering the terms of this Agreement, you
        may do so, but none of the terms and/or conditions printed or otherwise
        appearing or referenced on such form will be applicable to or shall
        modify or change your rights or obligations hereunder except for those
        terms and conditions concerning specific details with respect to matters
        such as date, location, and quantity provided that such terms and
        conditions are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth
        in this Agreement. MaxMind reserves the right to reject any purchase
        order or similar form which, in MaxMind's reasonable judgment, creates
        any ambiguity concerning which terms are applicable to this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        This Agreement shall terminate immediately if, within the reasonable
        judgment of MaxMind, you materially breach any material term or
        condition of this Agreement and fail to remedy the breach within ten
        (10) days of receipt of written notice thereof stating MaxMind's intent
        to terminate upon non-cure of the breach. MaxMind may immediately
        terminate this Agreement if MaxMind reasonably believes that terminating
        this Agreement is necessary for MaxMind to comply with any legal
        obligation. Your failure to comply with the Restrictions is a breach of
        a material term of this Agreement.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES/LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.
    <p>
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL MAXMIND OR ANY RELATED
      PARTY OR SUPPLIER BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR
      DATA, THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR THE
      INABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN
      CONTRACT, TORT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE
      EVEN IF MAXMIND HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES. THE
      TOTAL LIABILITY OF MAXMIND, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED
      TO THE AMOUNT OF FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
      DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO
      LIABILITY. YOU HEREBY RELEASE MAXMIND AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL
