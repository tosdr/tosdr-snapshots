  </ul>

  <p>Please do not provide any information that we do not request.</p>

  <h2>Information from Your Browser or Device when You Use the Services</h2>

  <p>
    When you use the Services, we and third parties we work with automatically
    collect information from your browser or device.
  </p>

  <p>The categories of information we automatically collect include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong>, including IP address.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device information</strong>, including browser language, time,
      session age, user agent, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet activity</strong>, including information about your
      browsing history and interactions, such as the features you use, pages you
      visit, content you view, purchases you make or consider, date and time of
      your visit, duration of your visit and referring and exiting pages and
      URLs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-precise location data</strong>, such as location derived from
      an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level. For
      clarity, MaxMind does not request access to or otherwise receive GPS
      signals from any devices when you access the Services.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The methods by which we collect such information include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a file stored on your browser that
      may be used to identify a device by storing certain personal preferences
      and user data. MaxMind uses cookies for a variety of purposes, including
      to help make our website work, identify authorized users of the MaxMind
      Account Portal, track affiliate referrals, complete online purchases
      through MaxMind's shopping carts, prevent fraud and assist with security,
      count visitors, and perform measurement and analytics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Web beacons are small graphic images or
      other web programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs"),
      which may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may
      be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming
      code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web
      beacons are often associated with cookies and used for similar purposes.
      Web beacons may also be used to count how many emails that were sent were
      actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were
      actually viewed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> Embedded scripts are programming code
      designed to collect information about a device's interactions with a
      website, such as the links clicked on. The code is temporarily downloaded
      onto your device from a server, is active only while you are connected to
      the website containing the embedded script, and is deactivated or deleted
      thereafter. Embedded scripts are used for similar purposes as cookies and
      web beacons.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Server Logs.</strong> Your web browser automatically sends
      information to every website you visit, including ours. For example, our
      server logs may receive and record your device information and internet
      activity. Our server logs may also receive a user agent string, which is a
      series of characters automatically sent with your internet requests that
      provide information necessary for smooth internet communications, such as
      the operating system and browser you used.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you interact with our Services, MaxMind may assign your computer or
    mobile device a unique identification number ("Unique ID"). MaxMind may set
    a cookie on your device containing, amongst other things, the device's
    Unique ID. MaxMind uses information generated from the Unique ID for
    purposes of improving our Services, primarily our ability to detect fraud.

  <h2>
    Information Provided through queries to the minFraud Service, GeoIP2 Web
    Service and GeoLite Web Service by MaxMind's customers
  </h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind is primarily a business-to-business service. When our customers use
    the minFraud Service, GeoIP2 Web Service and GeoLite Web Service, they send
    queries to MaxMind that can include information about others who may not
    have a direct relationship with MaxMind.
  </p>

  <strong> minFraud Service-</strong>

  <p>
    The minFraud Service helps businesses prevent online fraud by providing risk
    scoring and risk data related to online transactions. MaxMind’s customers
    then use this information provided by MaxMind to determine whether to
    proceed with a transaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind’s customers decide what data to submit to our minFraud Service. The
    categories of information our customers send to us through the minFraud
    Service include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact identifiers,</strong> including first and last name, email
      address, postal address, billing address, and phone number.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> including IP address.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device information,</strong> including browser language, time,
      session age, user agent, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Payment information,</strong> including partial credit card
      numbers such as the issuer ID number (IIN) and the last digits of a credit
      card (but not a full credit card number).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Commercial or transactional information,</strong> including
      records of products or services you have purchased, obtained, or
      considered, whether there is a reported chargeback, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom inputs determined by our customers.</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <strong>GeoIP2 Web Service and GeoLite Web Service-</strong>

  <p>
    MaxMind’s customers submit IP addresses through queries to the GeoIP2 Web
    Service and GeoLite Web Service and MaxMind returns certain information it
    has associated with that IP address such as postal code, city, state or
    country, ISP provider, domain name, connection type (e.g.
    Cable/DSL/Cellular), whether an IP address is associated with an anonymizer
    (such as a VPN, Tor Exit, Hosting provider, etc.), and similar data.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will treat the information in accordance with the practices described in
    this Privacy Policy to the extent we act as a controller. We will also
    comply with any additional restrictions applicable to the customer providing
    the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information from Other Sources</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind also receives information, including the categories of information
    listed above, from other sources. The categories of other sources from which
    we receive information include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Our business partners and resellers.</li>
    <li>
      Publicly available sources such as open government databases or other data
      in the public domain.
    </li>
    <li>
      From social media. For example, if you contact us through Twitter or
      LinkedIn.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will treat the information in accordance with the practices described in
    this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source
    of the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Infer</h2>

  <p>
    We infer new information from other information we collect, including
    generating information for the purposes of providing, enhancing, or
    improving our IP address intelligence and, fraud detection, and other
    services and products. For example, we generate fraud analysis data for our
    customers to help detect fraud.
  </p>

  <h1 class="anchor-target" id="how-maxmind-uses-information">
    3. HOW MAXMIND USES INFORMATION
  </h1>

  <p>
    We collect and use information for our legitimate interests and for business
    and commercial purposes in accordance with the practices described in this
    Privacy Policy. Our purposes for collecting and using information include:
  </p>

  <h2>Providing Our Services</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind uses information for the purposes of providing its IP address
    intelligence, fraud detection, and other services and products.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong
      >How MaxMind Uses Information Provided by MaxMind’s customers through
      queries to the minFraud Service</strong
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind uses data from customer queries submitted to the minFraud Service
    for the following purposes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>To provide services to the customer who sent us the data.</strong
      >We use the data submitted by our customers for the purpose of providing
      risk scores and to provide additional information or feedback to the
      customer who sent us the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >To improve our minFraud Service to provide the minFraud Service to
        other customers.</strong
      >
      In some instances, we process and aggregate data submitted to the minFraud
      service and use it to improve the minFraud Service in order to provide
      other customers with licensed data, more accurate information, robust risk
      score information and the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity.
      For example, if we receive reports of chargebacks from one MaxMind
      customer that could impact the risk score returned to a different MaxMind
      customer. Not all data submitted to minFraud is used for this purpose, and
      for some minFraud customers we do not use any data submitted in queries
      for this purpose. MaxMind does not use custom inputs provided by our
      customers to provide services to unrelated customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>To improve our IP address intelligence services.</strong> In some
      instances, MaxMind uses some of the personal data provided through our
      minFraud Service for the purpose of improving the accuracy of our IP
      address intelligence services. MaxMind’s IP address intelligence services
      include our GeoIP Databases, GeoIP2 Web Services, GeoLite Databases and
      GeoLite Web Services. The IP address intelligence services associate IP
      addresses with certain information such as a postal code, city, state or
      country, ISP provider, domain name, connection type (e.g.
      Cable/DSL/Cellular), whether an IP address is associated with an
      anonymizer (such as a VPN, Tor Exit, Hosting provider, etc.), and similar
      data. Our IP address intelligence services are licensed to customers for a
      variety of purposes, including fraud prevention, geofencing, sanctions
      compliance, enforcing licensing restrictions, serving advertisements,
      customizing website content, etc. Not all data submitted to minFraud is
      used for this purpose, and for some minFraud customers we do not use any
      data submitted in queries for this purpose.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong
      >How MaxMind Uses Information Provided by MaxMind’s customers through
      queries to the GeoIP2 Web Service and GeoLite Web Service</strong
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind uses the IP addresses submitted to the GeoIP2 Web Service and
    GeoLite Web Service for the purpose of improving some of our Services,
    including without limitation the minFraud Service, the GeoIP2 Web Service,
    GeoLite Web Service and GeoIP Databases.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong
      >How MaxMind Uses Information Provided by MaxMind Customers through
      JavaScript.</strong
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind offers a GeoIP2 JavaScript Client API available to its customers via
    geoip-js.com and js.maxmind.com. Where a MaxMind customer uses the GeoIP2
    JavaScript Client API, MaxMind collects device identifiers, device
    information (e.g., HTTP headers), provided via geoip-js.com or
    js.maxmind.com on behalf of the customer, and logs such information only for
    the purposes of monitoring, alerting, and internal reporting for the
    specific customer for up to 30 days. MaxMind does not disclose information
    collected through geoip-js.com or js.maxmind.com among customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the Services offered by MaxMind may require a MaxMind customer to
    place a snippet of JavaScript on the customer's own website (either by the
    customer itself or by MaxMind), and that JavaScript collects information
    used by MaxMind to create the Unique ID. If the customer uses the MaxMind
    minFraud service, it may receive back the Unique ID MaxMind associated with
    the IP address being used in the request made to the minFraud service.
  </p>

  <h2>Communications with You</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind maintains one or more contact lists (with email addresses and other
    contact identifiers) to allow MaxMind to communicate with individuals who do
    business with MaxMind or who have expressed an interest in the Services. We
    may contact you to confirm your purchases or respond to requests that you
    make, notify you of changes to your account or the Services, for security
    purposes, for marketing purposes, or to otherwise inform you of information
    related to our business or your account with us.
  </p>

  <h2>Website Administration and Customization</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind uses information for a variety of website administration and
    customization purposes. For example, we use information to process your
    registration requests, send you email updates and other communications,
    customize features, and deliver content to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage of IP Addresses</h2>

  <p>
    The MaxMind services, including the minFraud service, use IP addresses to
    help organizations detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Among other
    things, MaxMind obtains IP addresses and order information (including
    billing address) through its minFraud service. MaxMind uses the billing
    location from this data along with other data to create databases that pair
    IP addresses with the locations in which they are likely being used, down to
    a postal code level of resolution.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytics and Improvement</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind uses information to understand trends, usage, and activities, and to
    improve its products and services.
  </p>

  <h2>Correction Requests</h2>

    you can submit a data correction request to us through our website at

  <h1 class="anchor-target" id="how-maxmind-shares-information">
    4. HOW MAXMIND DISCLOSES INFORMATION
  </h1>

  <p>
    We disclose information we collect in accordance with the practices
    described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of sources to whom we
    disclose information include:
  </p>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>

  <p>
    We provide your information to our service providers, and contractors for
    the purpose of delivering services to you as well as for purposes related to
    Services administration and operation, including conducting analytics and
    helping us with sales tax compliance. When disclosing information for the
    purpose of providing you with the services you request, we will disclose
    your information only as necessary for the service provider working on
    MaxMind's behalf to complete its work for us. For example, if you use a
    credit or debit card to complete a transaction on the Services, we will
    disclose your credit or debit card number with a payment processing and/or a
    fulfillment company in order to complete your transaction.
  </p>

  <h2>Databases</h2>

  <p>
    One aspect of MaxMind's products and services is the provision of databases
    to our customers and other third parties, including our business partners
    and resellers. These databases include information such as IP addresses and
    corresponding data pertaining to such IP addresses, such as non-precise
    location data, fraud analysis data, and related information. Such databases
    are compiled using numerous data sources, including information we receive
    from our customers when individuals make purchases or conduct other
    transactions with our customers. In addition, we respond to API queries from
    our customers, and such responses may include information about the level of
    risk we associate with information about your device or email address, or
    your Unique ID
  </p>

  <h2>Customers</h2>

  <p>
    We may disclose your information to our customers in connection with us
    processing your information on their behalf. For example, we may disclose
    your information to our customers to provide them with our products and
    services, respond to questions and comments, fulfill your requests, and
    otherwise comply with applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>Vendors and Other Parties</h2>

  <p>
    We may disclose your information to vendors and other parties for purposes
    of providing you with marketing, measuring and improving our Service, and
    enabling other enhancements. Vendors may act as our service providers, or in
    certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind integrates with the service Have I Been Pwned to verify whether your
    account password has previously appeared in a third party data breach, which
    may allow MaxMind to evaluate the strength of the password, provide a
    warning, and/or block the password outright. We are not responsible for the
    effectiveness or accuracy of their information. For more information on Have
    I Been Pwned, please visit the website at

  <h2>Security and Compliance with the Law</h2>

  <p>
    We reserve the right to disclose your information to appropriate third
    parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is
    necessary in order (a) to comply with a legal process such as a search
    warrant, subpoena, or court order; (b) to protect the company's rights and
    property; (c) to investigate reports of users sending material using a false
    email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;
    (d) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Services; or (e) to
    respond to emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is
    at risk. MaxMind may be required to disclose information in a
    life-threatening emergency or in response to a lawful request by public
    authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
    requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Transfer of Business</h2>

  <p>
    Over time, MaxMind may buy or sell various assets. In the event that we sell
    some or all of our assets, or our company is acquired by another company, or
    during the negotiation of such sale or acquisition, our databases and any
    information we collect may be among the transferred or negotiated assets.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>

  <p>
    We may disclose your information for any other purpose disclosed to you and
    with your consent or at your direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, MaxMind discloses
    information that does not identify you to third parties, including our
    customers, for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. For
    information on your rights and choices regarding how we disclose your

    customers and third parties for security, fraud detection, customizing
    content for website visitors (including displaying the appropriate language,

  <p>
    The California Privacy Rights Act ("<strong>CPRA</strong>") provides
    additional rights to California residents. This section addresses those
    rights and applies only to California residents. Terms have the meaning
    ascribed to them under CPRA unless otherwise stated.
  </p>

  <h2 class="anchor-target" id="california-notice-of-collection">
    Notice at Collection
  </h2>

  <p>
    At or before the time of collection of your personal information, you have a
    right to receive notice of our data practices. Our data practices are as
    follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      For the categories of personal information we have collected in the past
      12 months, see the <strong>Information MaxMind Collects</strong> section
      above.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the categories of sources from which personal information is
      collected, see the <strong>Information MaxMind Collects</strong> section
      above.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the specific business and commercial purposes for collecting and using
      personal information, see the
      <strong>How MaxMind Uses Information</strong> section above.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the categories of third parties to whom information is disclosed, see
      the <strong>How MaxMind Discloses Information</strong> section above.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the criteria used to determine the period of time information will be
      retained, see the <strong>Security and Retention</strong> section above.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some of our disclosures of personal information may be considered a "sale"
    or "share" as those terms are defined under CPRA. A "sale" is broadly
    defined under the CPRA to include a disclosure for something of value, and a
    "share" is broadly defined under CPRA to include a disclosure for
    cross-context behavioral advertising. MaxMind collects, sells, and shares
    the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes:
    contact identifiers, commercial or transactions information, device
    identifiers, device information, internet activity, non-precise geolocation
    data, and inferences drawn from any of the above. The categories of third
    parties to whom we may sell or share your personal information include,
    where applicable, vendors, business partners and customers. We do not
    knowingly "sell" as defined by the CPRA the personal information of minors
    under 16 years old who are California residents. For details about your
    rights regarding sales and shares, please see the "Right to Opt-Out of Sales
    and Sharing" section below.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to Know, Correct, and Delete</h2>

  <p>You have the right to request the following from us:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>
    <li>
      The categories of sources from which the personal information was
      collected;
    </li>
    <li>
      The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a
      business purpose or sold or shared;
    </li>
    <li>
      The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was
      disclosed for a business purpose or sold or shared;
    </li>
    <li>
      The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling or sharing
      the personal information; and
    </li>
    <li>
      The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In addition, subject to exceptions, you have the right to correct or delete
    the personal information we have collected from you.
  </p>

  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our online

    >, or call our toll free number at 1-844-802-0220. If you have an account
    with us, we may require you to use the account to submit the request. In the
    request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the
    scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days
    and respond to your request within 45 days. We may require specific
    information from you to help us verify your identity and process your
    request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request.
  </p>

  <p>
    If personal information about you has been processed by us as a service
    provider on behalf of a customer and you wish to exercise any rights you
    have with such personal information, please inquire with our customer
    directly. If you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide
    the name of our customer on whose behalf we processed your personal
    information. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support
    them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    To the extent MaxMind sells or shares your personal information as those
    terms are defined under the CPRA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale
    or sharing of your personal information, which you can exercise (i) by
    clicking
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/en/opt-out"
      >Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</a
    >
    or (ii) by turning on a recognized opt-out preference signal, such as Global
    Privacy Control ("GPC") in your browser or extension. If MaxMind detects a
    GPC signal in your browser or extension MaxMind will treat that as a request
    to opt-out of the sale or sharing of any personal information collected from
    your browser, but MaxMind will not opt your IP address out of our services
    unless you submit the webform located at
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/en/opt-out"
      >Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.</a
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    To the extent "sale" under the CPRA is interpreted to include the disclosure
    of MaxMind's databases as set out in the "How MaxMind Discloses Information"
    section MaxMind will comply with applicable law as to such activity. Please
    note that where we use and disclose personal information for purposes
    related to security, fraud detection, and other similar purposes, some of
    your rights may be limited to the extent that they adversely affect the
    rights and freedoms of other natural persons.
  </p>

  <h2>Authorized Agent</h2>

  <p>
    You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
    Requests must be submitted through the designated methods listed above.
    Except for opt-out requests, we will require written proof of the agent's
    permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
  </p>

  <h2>Right to Non-Discrimination</h2>

  <p>
    You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the
    exercise of any of your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>Shine the Light</h2>

  <p>
    California's "Shine the Light" law permits customers who are California
    residents to request certain details about how a business shares their
    personal information as defined by "Shine the Light" with third parties (and
    in some cases affiliates) for those third parties' or affiliates' own direct
    marketing purposes. California customers may request information about our
    compliance with this law by contacting us by email at
    <a href="mailto:california-privacy@maxmind.com"
      >california-privacy@maxmind.com</a
    >
    or by mail at the address set forth in Section 11 above. Any such inquiry
    must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the
    description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP
    code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per
    customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by
    means other than through this email or mail address.

  <h1 class="anchor-target" id="nevada">13. NEVADA</h1>

  <p>
    Nevada law requires certain businesses to establish a designated request
    address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business
    not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has
    collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the
    exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business
    to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal
    information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer from whom
    MaxMind has collected personal information and you wish to submit a request
    relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us at

    Some of the services we license to our customers could be used by our
    customers or others in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or
    similarly significant effects concerning you. For example, personal data
    processed through the minFraud service or personal data we license through

    processing of personal data in furtherance of decisions that produce legal
    or similarly significant effects concerning you, please follow the

    law in responding to your request. For requests relating to our customers'

  <h2>Right to Opt-Out of Processing for Targeted Advertising or Sales</h2>

      >Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a
    >
    or (ii) by turning on a recognized opt-out preference signal, such as GPC in

  </h1>

  <h2>Roles</h2>

  <p>
    EU, Swiss and UK data protection laws make a distinction between
    organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as
    "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of
    other organizations (known as "processors").
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally
    operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's
    services. The MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and
    means of the processing of personal data. Specifically, MaxMind's customer
    decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to
    provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed
    data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other
    services as purchased by the customer. Please visit the applicable
    customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its
    services and/or databases. For example, MaxMind operates as a controller in
    connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website,
    including through data correction requests. Also, when MaxMind combines
    personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics
    services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction
    and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of
    its customers. For example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise
    de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in
    order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more
    other services provided to MaxMind customers.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>

  <p>
    If you are a data subject in the European Union, Switzerland or UK, you have
    the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected
    about you through the Services. You also have the right to data portability
    and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we
    have collected about you through the Services. In addition, you have the
    right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third
    parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different
    than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by
    you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do
    based on consent you have provided to us.
  </p>

  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section
    11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to
    your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you
    to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we store information
    as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may
    continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request
    for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply
    with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our
    agreements.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our
    customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such
    information, please inquire with our customer directly. If you wish to make
    your request directly to MaxMind, please provide the name of the MaxMind
    customer on whose behalf MaxMind processes your information. We will refer
    your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required
    by applicable law in responding to your request.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a
    complaint with a European supervisory authority.
  </p>

  <h2>Lawful Basis</h2>

  <p>
    MaxMind processes personal data consistent with the lawful basis available
    under law.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some instances, MaxMind’s lawful basis for processing personal data is
    consent. For example, individuals in the EU, Switzerland and UK can provide
    opt-in consent to our marketing emails. In other instances, MaxMind’s lawful
    basis for processing personal data is to comply with a legal obligation,
    such as if we were to receive a subpoena or court order requiring the
    disclosure of personal data.
  </p>

  <p>
    In most instances, MaxMind’s lawful basis for processing personal data is
    for our or our customers’ legitimate interests. MaxMind’s legitimate
    interests include the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>To detect and prevent fraud.</li>
    <li>
      To provide, enhance and improve the accuracy and scope of our IP address
      intelligence and fraud detection products and services.
    </li>
    <li>
      To create and manage accounts, confirm purchases, communicate, market and
      provide information related to our business relationships.
    </li>
    <li>To establish, exercise and defend legal rights.</li>
    <li>Website administration and customization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Transfer</h2>

  <p>
    For personal data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and
    Switzerland to third countries that do not ensure an adequate level of data
    protection, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through the use
    of Standard Contractual Clauses.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, MaxMind complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
    (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S.
    Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department
    of Commerce.  MaxMind has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that
    it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles
    (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data
    received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the
    EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  MaxMind has certified
    to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data
    Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the
    processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the
    Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy
    policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles,
    the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework

  <h1 class="anchor-target" id="brazil">16. BRAZIL</h1>

  <h2>Roles</h2>

  <p>
    Brazilian data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that
    process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and
    organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations
    (known as "processors").
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally
    operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's
    services. The MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and
    means of the processing of personal data. Specifically, MaxMind's customer
    decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to
    provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed
    data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other
    services as purchased by the customer. Please visit the applicable
    customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its
    services and/or databases. For example, MaxMind operates as a controller in
    connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website,
    including through data correction requests. Also, when MaxMind combines
    personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics
    services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction
    and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of
    its customers. For example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise
    de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in
    order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more
    other services provided to MaxMind customers.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>

  <p>
    If you are a data subject in Brazil, you have the right to access, rectify,
    or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services.
    You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or
    object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you
    through the Services. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to
    process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) when
    the processing is based on a lawful basis provided under the law. This kind
    of request is different from raising a concern that your consent is
    noncompliant with the provisions of the LGPD, including raising a concern
    that your data is being used for purposes materially different than for
    which it was originally collected. You may withdraw your consent at any time
    for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
  </p>

  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section
    11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise. To exercise your
    right for confirmation of the existence of processing, access to data,
    portability of data, deletion of personal data, revocation of consent, or
    information on public and private entities with which the controller has
    shared the data, please submit a request through our online form available
    at
    <a href="/en/lgpd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >/en/lgpd</a
    >. We will respond to your request within 30 days and within 15 days if you
    would like MaxMind to confirm if your data is processed by us or to exercise
    the right of access to your personal data. We may require additional
    information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that
    we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
    collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a
    data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as
    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent
    fraud, and enforce our agreements.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our
    customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such
    information, please inquire with our customer directly. If you wish to make
    your request directly to MaxMind, please provide the name of the MaxMind
    customer on whose behalf MaxMind processes your information. We will refer
    your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required
    by applicable law in responding to your request.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a
    complaint with the Brazilian supervisory authority or other authority
    indicated within applicable Law.
