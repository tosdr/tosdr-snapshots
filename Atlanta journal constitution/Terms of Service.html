Your UGC should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties. Do not use any UGC that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet. If anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to AJC Network. (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to AJC Network<b> </b>as your UGC, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so).</p><p class="story-text " data-index="58">· <b>Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.</b> If you choose to submit photos to the Sites, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="59">· <b>Act Appropriately.</b> All of your Sites activities must be venue-appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Forums for everyone to enjoy. If you think your UGC might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will, and it doesn’t belong on the Sites. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your UGC must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or handicap. Your UGC must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit. Your UGC must not exploit children under the age of 18.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="60">· <b>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.</b> Your UGC must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="61">· <b>Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications.</b> Do not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Sites by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications.

This also includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing, or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="62">· <b>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes. </b>Your UGC must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="63">· <b>Be</b> <b>Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your UGC.</b> Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit UGC that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company. In the event you receive anything in consideration from us with respect to your UGC (<i>e.g.</i>, coupons, sweepstakes entries, etc.) you represent you will include disclosure of the receipt of this consideration clearly and conspicuously as part of the UGC and include any other disclosures we may require.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="64">· <b>Others Can See.</b> We hope that you will use the Forums to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members. However, please remember that the Forums are public or semi-public and UGC that you submit on the Sites within a Forum may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Forum spaces and take care when otherwise disclosing this type of information to others.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="65">· <b>Don’t Share Other People’s Personal Information.</b> Your UGC should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by AJC Network (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).</p><p class="story-text " data-index="66">· <b>Don’t Damage the Services or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.</b> Your UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Services or any computer or other Device.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="67">If you submit UGC that AJC Network<b> </b>reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.

With that sole exception which shall be broadly construed, the term “Dispute” shall be given the broadest possible meaning. You and AJC Network also agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to any services or products provided to you by AJC Network under any other agreement. Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you and AJC Network may bring appropriate Disputes against each other in small claims court, if the Dispute falls within the small claims court’s jurisdiction.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="111"><b>B. Opt-out:</b> You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 10(G) or the survival terms in Section 10(H)) by notifying AJC Network of that intent during the Opt-Out Period by sending an email to AJC Network at <a href="mailto:ajcprivacy@coxinc.com">ajcprivacy@coxinc.com</a> or a letter via U.S. mail to AJC Network Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205-A Peachtree Dunwoody Road NE Atlanta, GA 30328 stating that you are opting out of this dispute resolution provision.

If you enter into new terms with AJC Network that includes a dispute resolution provision and you want to opt out of that provision, you will need to follow the instructions in that agreement for opting out.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="112"><b>C. “Class Action Waiver”; “Class Action Arbitration”; and “Collective Arbitration Waiver”:</b> You and AJC Network agree that all Disputes between you and AJC Network will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, collective, coordinated representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration (a “<b>Class or Collective Arbitration</b>”). You and AJC Network agree that any action or agreement by you to bring claims or to participate in any claims related to a Dispute in a Class or Collective Arbitration is contrary to these Terms. A Collective Arbitration shall include, but is not limited to, any claim (i) to resolve a Dispute involving two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration filed by or on behalf of one or more claimants; (ii) which involves common questions of law or fact; (iii) which involves an agreement to cooperate or coordinate the arbitration demands being asserted against the same defendant(s); and (iv) is initiated at or near the same time. You and AJC Network agree that this class action waiver and Collective Arbitration waiver shall be binding in any arbitral proceeding. No arbitrator shall have the authority to consolidate, join, or allow the coordination of more than one (1) person’s claims or to preside over a class, collective, mass, or representative proceeding in any form. No arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the enforceability of this Section 10(C). If you or AJC Network brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis. Furthermore, neither you nor AJC Network may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts Disputes that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or AJC Network. We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 10 will not apply to any Dispute between you and AJC Network, except for the provisions of Section 10(G) waiving the right to jury trial. This class action and collective arbitration waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="113"><b>D. Arbitrator Authority:</b> The arbitration between you and AJC Network will be binding. In arbitration, there is no judge and <u>no jury</u>. Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by these Terms. You and AJC Network agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to these Terms. An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the Applicable Law (defined in Section 14(I)), but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with AJC Network. Review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="114"><b>E. Informal Dispute Resolution:</b> You and AJC Network agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration. If you have a dispute, first call AJC Network Customer Care at 1-404-522-4141. If an AJC Network representative is unable to resolve your dispute in a timely manner, you agree to then notify AJC Network of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to AJC Network Legal Department, Attn: Corporate Escalation Team, 6205-A Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328 so that AJC Network can attempt to resolve it with you. If AJC Network does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving written notice to AJC Network Customer Care of your claim, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration. Neither you nor AJC Network may initiate arbitration without first following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph and thereafter, if the dispute is still not resolved, the party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other written notice of the intent to file for arbitration. If you are sending a written notice of your intent to file for arbitration to AJC Network, please send such notice via U.S. mail to the AJC Network Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205-B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328. If AJC Network is sending you a written notice of our intent to file for arbitration, we will send it to the last known address of record we have on file for you.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="115"><b>F. Arbitration Procedures:</b> You and AJC Network agree that these Terms and the services AJC Network provides to you affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, and not state arbitration laws, applies for all Disputes. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA’s rules are available on its website at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA’s rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control. To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to AJC Network at <a href="mailto:ajcprivacy@coxinc.com">ajcprivacy@coxinc.com</a> or via U.S. mail to AJC Network Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205-A Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328. You must also comply with the AAA’s rules regarding initiation of arbitration. AJC Network will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to these Terms or Applicable Law. AJC Network will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration, even if allowed under the law, unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous. If you are successful in the arbitration, AJC Network will pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than AJC Network’s last written settlement offer, AJC Network will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration. The arbitration will be held in the county of Atlanta, Georgia and either party may appear either in person or by telephone.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="116"><b>G. Jury Trial Waiver:</b> If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and AJC Network expressly and knowingly <b>WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</b>. This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and AJC Network if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="117"><b>H.
