      <small class="uk-text-meta">Last updated: December 07, 2020</small>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms and conditions ("Terms", "Terms and conditions") carefully before using the https://jimpl.com website
        (the "Service") operated by Jimpl ("us", "we", or "our").
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
        These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The materials on the Service are provided on an 'as is' basis.
        Jimpl makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
        limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness
        for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Jimpl does not
        warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its
        website
        or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        In no event shall Jimpl or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
        profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the Service, even if Jimpl
        or a Jimpl authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some
        jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
        these limitations may not apply to you.
      </p>

      <h2>Accuracy of materials</h2>
      <p>
        The materials appearing on the Service could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.
        Jimpl does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current.
        Jimpl may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice.
        However Jimpl does not make any commitment to update the materials.
      </p>

      <h2>Links to other web sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Jimpl. Jimpl has no
        control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or
        services.
        You further acknowledge and agree that Jimpl shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
        caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or
        through any such web sites or services. We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any
        third-party web sites or services that you visit.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
        including
        without limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall
        survive
        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
      </p>

      <h2>Modifications</h2>
      <p>
        Jimpl may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be
        bound by the then current version of these terms of service.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, without regard to its conflict of law
        provisions.
        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
        these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
        Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have
        between us regarding the Service.
      </p>
