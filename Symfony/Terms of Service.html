                <h1>SymfonyConnect Terms Of Service</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="https://connect.symfony.com">https://connect.symfony.com</a>
        - Version 1.3 dated September 2018
    </p>

    <p>
        The site https://connect.symfony.com (the “Site”) is operated by
        SYMFONY, a simplified stock company with capital of 875,000 €, registered
        with the Trade and Corporate Registry of Nanterre under Number 834 643 579,
        with its main office located at 163 quai du Docteur Dervaux - CS 30083 - 92665 Asnières sur Seine, France,
        represented by its Chairman Mr. Fabien POTENCIER (“Symfony”).
    </p>

    <p>
        By using the Site, visitors agree to abide and be bound by these terms of
        service (the "TOS") and/or any revised version. Any new service available on
        the Site or any modification of an existing service shall be governed by the
        TOS, which may be modified or updated from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Symfony strongly encourages visitors to regularly review the TOS and the
        <a href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>I. Description of the services offered by the site</h2>

    <h3>1. Presentation of the Site</h3>

    <p>
        The Site is an online platform which offers services from Symfony (the “Services”).
    </p>

    <p>
        Symfony provides its users ("Users") the Site for non-commercial, personal
        use. To use the Site, Users must open an account (the “Account”).
    </p>

    <p>
        The use of the Services is free (except for the cost of connecting to the
        internet) and requires a terminal.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Joining the community by creating and managing an Account</h3>

    <p>
        By creating an Account, Users can join the Symfony community and :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Edit their profile, which may contains their personal data (picture,
            birthday, company, job position, city, country and biography) in the
            “real-life” and online (link to their GitHub®, Twitter®, blog URL,
            blogsite, etc.);
        </li>
        <li>
            Edit and administrate their Account;
        </li>
        <li>
            View their profile accessible to the other Users (the “Public Profile”) and which contains their content;
        </li>
        <li>
            Manage and publish their content;
        </li>
        <li>
            Consult their notifications from Symfony;
        </li>
        <li>
            Collect badges (“Badges”) and redeem a badge code to get a new one;
        </li>
        <li>
            Cancel their Account;
        </li>
        <li>
            Purchase tickets for Symfony® conferences;
        </li>
        <li>
            Subscribe to SymfonyInsight®, an automated code quality analysis service.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Site enables Users to create and share content ("Users Content" or “Their Content”).
    </p>

    <p>
        Each User can also personalize a page accessible to the other Users and
        associated with a specific URL (the "Public Page"). The others Users may see
        the User’ biography, the city where he/she leaves, the name of his/her company,
        the date of creation of the Account, the Badges and the link to other websites.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Research on the Site</h3>

    <p>
        Users can use the search engine on the Site and access the Public Profiles of
        the other Users pages.
    </p>

    <h2>II. Accessing the services</h2>

    <p>
        To access and use the Services, Users must be legally capable of entering into
        a binding agreement and abide by all applicable statutes (French and/or
        foreign).
    </p>
    <p>
        Users also acknowledge that the activity of creating and sharing their Content
        may give rise to various types of legal liabilities and Users represent that
        their Content complies at all times with the TOS and all applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users understand that Symfony does not exercise any control over and does
        not pre-screen Their Content and may not be held liable for their communication
        to the public.
    </p>

    <h2>III. Creation of the account</h2>

    <p>
        To Use the Services, Users will need to create an Account by providing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>their name;</li>
        <li>their country;</li>
        <li>a username;</li>
        <li>a valid email address;</li>
        <li>a password of their choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The provided email address must remain valid as long as the associated Account remains
        active and it is the User’s responsibility to update it should it no longer be
        accurate or current.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users password is strictly personal and confidential and Users shall not share
        it with any third-party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users should immediately contact Symfony if they have reason to believe that
        their password is being used by an unauthorized third party. Users shall be
        liable for all actions taken with their password as well as for any loss or
        liability consequential to such use. Symfony may cancel the Account of any
        User without notice in the case of any violation of the TOS.
    </p>

    <h2>IV. Conduct of users</h2>

    <p>
        As a condition for accessing and using the Site and the Services, Users agree:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            To always provide truthful and actual personal data and to update them as needed so that they remain true,
            complete and accurate ;
        </li>
        <li>
            To respect the rights of others and, more generally, all applicable laws and regulations relevant to the use
            of the Services ;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to engage in any conduct that would interrupt, destroy, limit or more generally harm the Site and/or the
            Services or enable Users to gain unauthorized access to the Site, including by using viruses, malicious
            code, programs or files ;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to reproduce, copy, sell, or commercially use (including the right to access) in whole or in part, the
            Services and/or Site ;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to post, share, or otherwise transmit any content that is unlawful, obscene, harmful, threatening,
            defamatory or hateful or that contains objects or symbols of hate, invades the privacy of any third party,
            or is otherwise objectionable;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to make available any content that they do not have the lawful right to transmit (including any content
            that would violate any confidentiality undertaking), that would infringe the intellectual or proprietary
            rights of any third party (including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks or patent
            rights), or that would violate the right of privacy or publicity of any public or non-public persons;
        </li>
        <li>
            To respect the privacy of others, including that of the other Users, and the confidentiality of the
            information they may receive and not to post, email or otherwise transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized
            advertising, promotional materials or any other form of solicitation;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to harass any other Users or to impersonate another User by any means;
        </li>
        <li>
            Not to create more than one User Account;
        </li>
        <li>
            If Symfony cancels a User Account, not to create another one without its permission.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In case of any violation of the above, Symfony reserves the right to cancel
        the Account of the User and/or to block her/him from accessing the Site as well
        as to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law and regulation
        as well as governmental or judicial request, at its sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>V. Posting and sharing users content</h2>

        for said Content. Users shall verify that Their Content is in compliance with
        the TOS and, more generally, is not harmful or unlawful.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Distribution of Users’ Content by Symfony</h3>

    <p>
        Users expressly grant Symfony the right to, directly and indirectly,
        distribute Their Content. Symfony may distribute Users’ Content for

    <h3>1. Access to the Site</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony is the sole holder of all proprietary rights to the Site and the
        Services including the Users’ databases. Any reproduction, display, publication,
        transmission or, more generally, any unauthorized use of the Site or the
        Services may trigger Users’ liability and result in criminal or civil legal
        action. Users undertake not to access the Services by any means other than
        those made available to them by Symfony.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Intellectual Property – Copyright</h3>

    <p>
        The Site is an original work protected by intellectual property laws and
        international conventions. Users warrant that they will not modify, lease,

        wholly or partly on the Site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users may access the Site for their personal use only. Printing is limited to
        their personal non-commercial use. Any other use or communication is prohibited

    </p>

    <h3>4. Intellectual Property of Others</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony respects the intellectual property of others. If Users believe that
        material over which they have rights has been reproduced or used in such a way
        as to constitute an infringement, they must contact Symfony (article VI. of
        TOS).

    <h3>5. Users’ Content</h3>

    <p>
        Users hereby grant Symfony the right to incorporate in its Services and Site
        Their Content and as such reproduce, display, perform, adapt, and communicate
        to the public Their Content. Users further grant Symfony the right to
        reproduce their trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, domain names or
        other identifying signs or images. Those rights are granted free of charge for
        Symfony.
    </p>

    <h2>IX. Data processing provisions for hosting services</h2>

    <p>
        Symfony may store and host personal data on behalf of Users. Users shall retain
        all usage rights regarding personal data processed by Symfony in the context of
        the hosting services.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Symfony’s duties</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony as a data processor shall only act upon Users’ instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Symfony undertakes to process hosted personal data solely for hosting services
        and according to Users’ instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Symfony shall not store personal data beyond the duration instructed by Users
        and shall not retain any personal data upon deletion of the Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        In case of a security issue or a non-authorized disclosure and/or violation of
        personal data, Symfony undertakes to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            provide Users with an advisory information no later than seventy-two (72)
            hours following the incident occurrence;
        </li>
        <li>
            notify Users of any identified violation of personal data by issuing
            relevant information allowing Users to comply with their own obligations
            within legal deadlines, and reporting such violation to a supervisory
            authority. Such information includes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    description of the nature of the personal data violation, including
                    if available, categories and approximate count of impacted
                    individuals and categories and approximate count of personal data
                    records impacted by the violation,
                </li>
                <li>
                    description of potential consequences of the corresponding personal
                    data violation.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Symfony does not own the uploaded data. The User is solely responsible for the
        data uploaded by her/him and its accuracy, quality, integrity and legality.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Users’ duties</h3>

    <p>
        Users undertake to provide Symfony with personal data necessary for the
        instructed processing and assist Symfony into conforming to its obligations
        regarding personal data protection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users undertake to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements, in
        particular those related to personal data and to third parties rights, including
        individual rights, intellectual or industrial property rights such as copyright,
        patent law, design protection rights and trademark law.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users are informed of the regulations related to personal data protection, in
        particular as regards their obligations, including the principle of
        accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, Users are fully responsible if the uploaded data violate third
        party rights and shall indemnify Symfony for all claims related to this breach
        and / or illegality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users retain control over all the uploaded data, which is considered their
        property. At the Users’ request, Symfony may delete, modify, edit or alter any
        uploaded data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users acknowledge that Symfony does not host their uploaded data indefinitely
        and that it is their responsibility to ensure the export of the last backup of
        their uploaded data, upon the deletion of the Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of the contractual relationship for any reason whatsoever, Users
        shall download their data.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Information</h3>

    <p>
        Users are liable to provide involved individuals with information regarding
        personal data processing.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Subcontracting to third parties</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony may subcontract specific processing to be conducted by third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Duty of cooperation with the relevant data protection authorities</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony and Users undertake to cooperate with relevant data protection
        authorities, in particular in case of an information request or in case
        of control.
    </p>

    <h2>X. Disclaimer</h2>

    <h3>1. Limitation of Liability</h3>

    <p>
        The Services and the Site are made available to Users "as is." Symfony makes
        no warranty, whether implied or express, as to the Services and the Site. In
        particular and without limitation, Symfony may not warrant the continuity
        and quality of the Services available on the Site, or the fact that the Site
        will be permanently accessible, or that other Users will not violate the TOS or
        its Privacy Policy. Symfony may limit the use of its Services. Symfony
        may not be held liable for the failure to make available, or for the deletion
        of, Users’ Content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users understand that they are accessing and using the Site and the Services at
        their own risk. Symfony may not be held liable for their reliance on any
        information or data they may have accessed, directly or indirectly, through the
        Services, nor for their accessing or downloading of any material, program, or
        file through the Services. Symfony may not be held liable for any loss of
        data or for any damage to their terminal used to access the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Symfony uses its best efforts and all available means to ensure the
        confidentiality of Users’ personal data, Symfony may not be held liable in
        the case of a breach of said confidentiality, regardless of its cause
        (including, but not limited to, technical difficulty, intrusion into our data
        processing system, or human mistake).
    </p>
    <p>
        More generally, Users accept that Symfony may not be held liable for any
        consequential, special, or incidental damages, direct or indirect, resulting
        from the access to, or use of, the Services and/or Site and that the limitation
        of liability applies to Symfony and to its affiliated companies, principals,
        directors, agents, and employees.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Third-Party Content – Links</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony has no control over third-party content and third-party services.
        Similarly, Symfony cannot control links to other websites or other internet
        resources. These resources, contents and services are provided to Users "as
        is".
    </p>
    <p>
        Users acknowledge that Symfony may not be held liable with respect to
        third-party resources, contents or services and Users undertake to directly and
        exclusively contact the appropriate third party with any claim or request Users
        may have. Symfony may not be held liable with respect to the content,
        advertisements, products, services or any other data or information available
        on or from those external sites or sources nor for any damages or loss arising
        from or connected with the use of or the reliance on such contents, resources,
        or services available.
    </p>

    <h2>XI. Warranties</h2>

    <p>
        Users expressly warrant that they own all the rights to, or have secured all
        the necessary authorizations for, the use of Their Content, including the right
        to sublicense those rights. As Symfony does not exercise any control over
        Their Content, Users understand that Symfony may not be held liable for its
        communication to the public and share Their Content under their sole
        responsibility. Users’ Content shall at all times be in compliance with the
        Symfony TOS and, more generally, is not harmful or unlawful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, Users represent that they shall hold harmless (including reasonable
        attorneys' fees) Symfony, its affiliated companies, its principals, its
        agents, its administrators, and its employees from and against any claim by any
        third party arising out of or connected with the use of the Services, Their
        Content, the violation of the TOS, or, more generally, the violation of the
        law.
    </p>

    <h2>XII. Termination of the account</h2>

    <p>
        In the case of violation of the TOS by Users, Symfony reserves the right to limit
        their access to the Site and/or to rename or terminate their Account. Users
        understand and accept that Symfony may not be held liable for the
        cancellation of their Account.
    </p>

    <h2>XIII. Miscellaneous</h2>

    <h3>1. Update and Modification</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony reserves the right to correct possible errors on the Site and, more
        generally, to modify, from time to time and without notice, the Site or any
        part thereof. Symfony may not be held liable for any modification,
        interruption, or suspension of the Services or for any resulting damages.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Notification</h3>

    <p>
        Symfony may send notifications to Users via email, or via the Site.
        Symfony may use this method, for instance, to inform Users of future
        revisions to the TOS.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Severability</h3>

    <p>
        If any provision of the TOS is adjudged by a court to be void or unenforceable,
        this shall in no way affect any other provision of the TOS, which shall remain
        in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Choice of Law </h3>

    <p>
        THE TOS AND USERS RELATIONSHIP WITH SYMFONY ARE GOVERNED BY FRENCH LAW. TO
        THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FRENCH COURTS SHALL HAVE
        JURISDICTION OVER ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE
        SERVICES OR THE SITE.
