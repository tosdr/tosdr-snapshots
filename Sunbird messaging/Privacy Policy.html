Introduction</strong></p><p>Welcome. You have arrived at a website provided by Sunbird Messaging Inc. (“<strong>Sunbird</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”). Sunbird Messaging is an Android &amp; web app that gives users the ability to unify the world’s most popular messaging apps into one app inbox including iMessage and SMS/MMS.</p><p>At Sunbird, we take your privacy seriously. We provide this Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>”) to tell you what information we collect about you, how we obtain it, how we share it, and how you may limit the ways in which we use your Personal Information. If you have questions about this Policy after you review it, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@sunbirdapp.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry">hello@sunbirdapp.com</a>.</p><p><strong class="bold-text-4">2. Scope</strong></p><p>This Policy<strong> </strong>governs <a href="http://www.sunbirdapp.com/">www.sunbirdapp.com</a>, its subdomains, and all subdomains or portals that link to this Policy (“<strong>Site</strong>”); our mobile application (“<strong>App</strong>”); or otherwise provide Personal Information or interact with us online or in-person. This Policy also applies to Personal Information that we may collect from you via phone calls or other communications with our representatives or in any other instance when you contact us. For the purpose of this Policy, &quot;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&quot; means any Personal Information relating to an identified or identifiable individual that is protected by applicable privacy laws, including Sensitive Personal Information. “<strong>Sensitive Personal Information</strong>” is Personal Information considered more critical such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or associations, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, and health or genetic information.</p><p>The definition of Personal Information does not include publicly available information from federal, state, or local government records, such as professional licenses and real estate or property records.</p><p>We refer to all the above as our “<strong>Services</strong>.” Our Services are used by users of our App (“<strong>App</strong> <strong>Users</strong>”) and visitors to our website (“<strong>Visitors</strong>”).</p><p id="step-3-how-it-works">By using our Sites or App or otherwise using our Services, you acknowledge this Policy and agree to our <a href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/terms-of-service"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a><strong> </strong>(“<strong>Terms</strong>”).</p><p><strong class="bold-text-4">3. How the Sunbird App Works</strong></p><p>At Sunbird, we value user privacy and security above all else. We offer a messaging service that is private, with the very least Personal Information collected on our Users. You must create a Sunbird App account to start using the App, we encrypt and salt your Sunbird App account password prior to storing it. For Users that connect an external messaging service such as iMessage or RCS/Google Messages, we never store your account credentials. For Visitors to the Site, we collect a small amount of Personal Information (1) for marketing and analytics purposes and (2) to give you information about or access to the App, the latter of which is with your <a href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/privacy-policy#step-12visitors">consent</a>.</p><p>Messages on the App are transmitted in an encrypted form using both TLS and message layer encryption using AES. Messages are temporarily decrypted at the moment of transfer to the native messaging app and exist in that state only within memory for a limited period of time. Messages are only ever stored on disk in an encrypted form. All media files transmitted through the Sunbird service are protected with strict access controls and automatically deleted after a period of time.  </p><p>Sunbird puts privacy on top of all other initiatives. By limiting the collection of Personal Information of our Users, and by not relying on advertising revenue, Sunbird enables Users to communicate securely and without fear of compromise. With our commitment to privacy and security, Sunbird sets a new standard for messaging services.</p><p><strong>4. What Information We Collect</strong></p><p>As a rule, we limit the Personal Information we collect to that which is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary for us to provide our Services to you. </p><h5><strong><em>Information That You Provide to Us</em></strong></h5><p>As you interact with our Site, App or Services, we collect the following Personal Information via webforms or inputs/uploads on our Site or App, and through other communications with you.</p><h5><strong><em>Visitors</em></strong></h5><ul role="list"><li>Contact information such as your first and last name, email address and mobile number.

These third parties also use cookies and other tracking technologies to capture information about your interactions with Sunbird. </p><p>Sunbird does not have control over the information that is collected, used, and shared by these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of these third parties to understand their privacy practices.</p><p><strong>5. Use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies on the Site</strong></p><p>We use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”).

When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (<em>e.g.</em>, browser do not track signals), but there is no universally agreed upon standard for what an organization should do when it detects a DNT signal. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms. You can learn more about Do Not Track <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">here</a>.</p><p><strong>11.
