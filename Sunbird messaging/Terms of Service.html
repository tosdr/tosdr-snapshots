Miscellaneous</strong></p><ol start="" role="list" class="list-4"><li>Independent Contractors. The parties and their respective personnel are and shall be independent contractors and neither party by virtue of these ToS shall have any right, power, or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party.<br/>‍</li><li>Amendment. Sunbird shall have the right, at any time, to add to or modify the terms of these ToS concerning the use of the App, simply by posting such amended terms via the App or online at <a href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/end-user-license-agreement">https://www.sunbirdapp.com/end-user-license-agreement</a>. User’s access to or use of the App after the date such amended terms are delivered to User shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such amended terms. User acknowledges that User has a responsibility to periodically review the most recent version of these ToS for updates, modifications and amendments that govern User’s use of the App<br/>‍</li><li>Waiver. No waiver of any term, provision or condition of these ToS, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other term, provision or condition hereof, whether or not similar, nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver of any such term, provision or condition hereof. No waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.<br/>‍</li><li>Severability. If any provision of these ToS is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, then such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain fully effective and enforceable.<br/>‍</li><li>Notice. Unless otherwise provided in these ToS, all notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be delivered when sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or when sent by email to either party’s last known post office or email address, respectively. User hereby consents to notice by email. Unless otherwise provided in these ToS, all notices shall be directed to the parties at the respective addresses given above or to such other address as either party may, from time to time, provide to the other party. Sunbird may send User via such email address Sunbird newsletters, product updates, service-related information and other offers and information from Sunbird or its business partners, and User hereby consents to such emails. Sunbird also may contact User by email to respond to any customer service or other inquiries User submits.<br/>‍</li><li>Action. No action arising under these ToS may be brought by User more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.<br/>‍</li><li>Equitable Relief. The parties agree that breach of the provisions of these ToS, including, but not limited to, the unauthorized use or duplication of the App, would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Sunbird which would be both difficult to ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone. As such, the parties agree that Sunbird has the right to enforce the provisions of these ToS by injunction (without necessity of posting bond), specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies Sunbird may have for User’s breach of these ToS.<br/>‍</li><li>Headings. The captions and headings of these ToS are included for ease of reference only and will be disregarded in interpreting or construing these ToS<br/>‍</li><li>Force Majeure. If the performance of any part of these ToS by either party (other than the payment of money) is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any flood, riot, fire, judicial or governmental action, labor disputes, act of God or any other causes beyond the control of either party, that party shall be excused from such to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such causes.<br/>‍</li><li>Survival. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, and representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability, and general provisions shall survive any termination of these ToS.<br/>‍</li><li>Entire ToS. This ToS and the other documents referenced herein constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect to the App and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, statements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties concerning the App.<br/>‍</li><li>Contact.
