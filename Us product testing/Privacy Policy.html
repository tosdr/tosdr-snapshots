                for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind

                a monetary benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly
                understood. We do allow Service Providers to use Your personal information
                for the business purposes described in Our Privacy Notice, for activities
                such as advertising, marketing, and analytics, and these may be deemed a

            <p>
                Category A: Identifiers
            </p>

                Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California

            </p>
            <p>
                Category F: Internet or other similar network activity
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the
                CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of
                personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our good faith belief
                to the best of Our knowledge that some of that information from the
                applicable category may be and may have been shared for value in return.

                Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age

            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age
                of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we
                link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use
                and privacy policies and We encourage parents and legal guardians to
                monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to
                never provide information on other websites without their permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are
                less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the
                "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years
                of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age.
                Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of
                future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your
                authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.
            </p>
            <p>
                If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has
                provided Us with personal information, please contact Us with sufficient
                detail to enable Us to delete that information.
