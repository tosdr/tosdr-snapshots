<p><strong>Sharing personal information is your choice and you can opt out:</strong> You can decide whether to provide personal information to us or organizations with which we conduct business as outlined in this policy. If you do not, you remain anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address or other de-identified authentication mechanism. If you provide us with personal information, you may also later opt out of our use of your personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a> or by following the unsubscribe instructions, including in newsletter and marketing emails. We will also remove you and your personal information from our records or refrain from using your personal information in connection with certain services on request if you contact us with your request at <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a>. Please note that this may prevent you from accessing ITHAKA’s services, including JSTOR, your personal JSTOR account, Publisher Sales Service, and certain Artstor websites and services as described below.</p>
<p><strong>You may review or edit your information:</strong> Upon request, ITHAKA will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information and allow you to delete or update your information to correct inaccuracies. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security precaution.</p>
<p>Please note, because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete or amend your information, residual copies of your information may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>
<p><strong>We will retain and use your data only as long as is appropriate:</strong> We will retain your information as long as you have not opted out and (i) as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services or (ii) as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We employ data retention policies to ensure that personal information is removed after provision of services has been terminated or if there has been prolonged account inactivity.</p>
<p><strong>You must be 16 or older:</strong> ITHAKA does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If it is discovered that we have collected personal information from someone under 16 we promptly will delete that information. <strong>Please note:</strong> As stated above, ITHAKA does not collect personal information unless you choose to share it. Users under 16 may use the ITHAKA Websites directly on the internet and/or through their institution account as long as they do not take steps to share their personal information.</p>

We will notify you of updates to this policy that affect use of your personal information: In order to reflect changes to our information practices, we may update this privacy policy from time to time. However, if we make any change in how we use the personal information you have already provided, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account). We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices and reach out to <a href="mailto:privacy@ithaka.org">privacy@ithaka.org</a> with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>We employ practices to hold your information securely:</strong> We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure through the use of passwords, physical security measures, managerial measures, and (in connection with credit card information for order sales through JPASS, the Publisher Sales Service, Individual Access, and for purchase of ITHAKA- branded merchandise) encryption through our third party service providers. We adhere to SOC 2 information security standards. SOC 2 is a technical audit that requires organizations to establish strict information security policies and procedures to protect customer data. ITHAKA undergoes annual external audits to ensure ongoing compliance with the physical, administrative, and technical safeguards required under the SOC 2 framework. For more details, please see our <a href="/ithaka-soc3-report">SOC 3 Report</a>.</p>
<p>We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from ITHAKA Websites. In the event that we discover or are notified of a security breach where personal information is at risk, we will notify you electronically if we have your email address and if you have not opted out of such communications.</p>
<p><strong>We seek to enforce this policy and will address complaints appropriately:</strong> We periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with applicable laws, including but not limited to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). If you have any concerns about the application of this policy, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> so we may investigate. We will attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.

<h4 class="h3">Using JSTOR, Artstor, Constellate, and/or Portico:<a class="anchor" name="services"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Through my institution’s account:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To enable your access to the JSTOR, Artstor, and Portico services through your library or institution and authenticate your identity for the purpose of accessing these services, we may collect information concerning the institution’s internet protocol address, your username and password, or other authentication methods, such as Shibboleth. You may also be able to authenticate via sign-in services utilized at your library or institution, such as Google Social Sign-On subject to Google’s privacy terms applicable to that service.</li>
<li>Administrators at participating institutions can invite users to create a personal account with institutional access, and possibly with administrator functionality, by sending an account creation invite to that person’s email address. The recipient of that invite must complete the account registration process to activate the account. The table of user accounts affiliated with the institution are available to the participating institution administrators online or via file sent to the relevant administrator’s account email.</li>
<li>For Artstor, to enable you to download images from the IAP service for publication purposes we collect and share with the institution providing the images for publication your name, email address, institutional affiliation, and other information you may provide. We may share your personal information with the content providers who provided those images for publication when you download an image for use in a publication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Through Publisher Sales Service, JPASS, or an Individual Access member program or to purchase JSTOR branded merchandise:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate your order through the Publisher Sales Service (a service through the JSTOR archive that facilitates the purchase of articles from publishers), JPASS, Individual Access, or to purchase ITHAKA branded merchandise, we may collect your name, postal address, email address and transactional information. We collect but do not store your credit card details through a third party service provider. ITHAKA may work with other organizations that provide specific services for us, such as credit card processing. We will provide only the personal information necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These organizations may not use personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>With a personal user account:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In connection with your voluntary creation of a personal account for JSTOR, Artstor, JSTOR Global Plants, or Constellate, we may collect your name, email address, username, institutional affiliation information, and password, as well as other information you may provide.</li>
<li>Please note that certain Artstor functions require creation of a user account, including: downloading images, saving them to groups, creating presentations and sharing them with other Artstor users, uploading content to Personal Collections, and managing content in JSTOR Forum.</li>
<li>Also in the case of Artstor services, to enable some institutions to provide administrative support services on behalf of their users, if you elect to register as a user of an Artstor website, you give ITHAKA permission to provide administrators at your institution, if it engages in this service, the email address you used to register so the administrator may access the image groups or other materials that you have created, make changes to such materials (including deleting such materials, either in full or in part), and contact you at the email address provided with respect to such materials, for the purpose of administering and supporting the institution’s subscription to the Artstor services and websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For admin and support:</strong> We collect your personal information for system and account administration, customer support, troubleshooting purposes, for new product announcements and product updates related to your account, for service announcements, and for delivering service newsletters and marketing communications you elect to receive.</li>
<li><strong>For requests for information:</strong> In connection with requests for additional information about JSTOR, Artstor, Constellate, JSTOR Forum, Transfer Explorer, or Portico, including but not limited to, obtaining access or additional information about these ITHAKA services on behalf of your institution, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, institutional affiliation information, country location, job title, and other information you may provide.</li>

<li>In some instances, Ithaka S+R may be contracted to provide services to third parties, which may involve collecting your personal information. In such cases, the privacy policy governing the collection of your personal information shall be as set forth in such third parties’ privacy policies and we may share your personal information with such third parties, such as an institution with which you are affiliated, where you explicitly consent to our sharing your information.</li>
