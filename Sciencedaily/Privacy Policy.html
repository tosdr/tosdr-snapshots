<p>ScienceDaily LLC ("ScienceDaily," "we," "us," or "our") provides this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, and share the information about individuals who visit our website at sciencedaily.com (the "Site").</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p>Like many websites, ScienceDaily collects information about how Site visitors use the Site in order to operate and improve our services.  For example, we collect information to gather statistics on how many visitors we our Site receives each month, determine the popularity of pages on the Site, and evaluate where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors.</p>

<p>When you visit the Site, we (and/or third-party services that we authorize) collect technical information relating to your device and your interactions with the Site -- if it is available -- including IP address, cookie identifiers, Internet service provider, domain name and country of origin of your computer, your operating system, device type, date and time of visit, pages visited and other activities on the Site, the type of web browser being used, and other information collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

<p>We collect your email address when you sign up for our newsletters through Substack.  We will also collect your email address and any information that you provide if you choose to contact us, such as if you submit feedback.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>

<p>ScienceDaily may use the information we collect for any lawful purpose.  We primarily use the information we collect to operate and improve the Site, provide our newsletters, and determine overall statistics about our readership. Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our Site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers -- upon whose support the Site depends -- and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our readership. Please note, however, that ScienceDaily does not attempt to identify its individual visitors about whom ScienceDaily has collected only technical information as described above.</p>

<p>We may also use the information we collect to comply with the law and to maintain the security of the Site.  Finally, we may use the information we collect with your consent, or as otherwise disclosed at the time information is collected.</p>

<p><strong>How We Share Information</strong></p>

<p>We may share the information we collect with other parties, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>With third-party service providers who process data on our behalf, such as email service providers;</li>
	<li>With advertising and marketing partners (but we do not share names or email addresses with these partners for their own purposes -- see below for details);</li>
	<li>As part of a corporate sale, merger, or acquisition, or other transfer of all or part of our assets, including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding;</li>
	<li>Pursuant to a subpoena, court order, governmental inquiry, or other legal process or as otherwise required by law, or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties; and</li>
	<li>With your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated without limitation.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Advertising and Analytics</strong></p>

<p>We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers ("Advertising Providers") that serve advertisements on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. These Advertising Providers may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Information used by Advertising Providers may include location data, if such information is made available based on settings that allow for the collection of such data in your web browser or mobile device. Some of the advertisements served by Advertising Providers may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.  This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.</p>

<p>You may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Webchoices tool at <a href="https://youradchoices.com">https://youradchoices.com</a> or the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org">https://optout.networkadvertising.org</a> to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in industry self-regulatory programs.  If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through these tools.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.  It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.  Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, the Site may not function as intended.</p>

<p>Finally, ScienceDaily works with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.  ScienceDaily uses certain third-party services, such as Google Analytics, to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.  For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use the Site, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>, and you can also opt-out of Google Analytics by using a browser plug-in that Google has developed (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)</strong></p>
<p>The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a &ldquo;device&rdquo;) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.</p>
<p>First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, &ldquo;Tags&rdquo;) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser&rsquo;s cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser&rsquo;s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All About Cookies</a>.</p>
<p>Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.</p>
<p>The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>Operating System type</li>
<li>Operating System version</li>
<li>Device Type</li>
<li>Language of the website</li>
<li>Web browser type</li>
<li>Email (in hashed form)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor&rsquo;s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit <a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">National Advertising Initiative opt out page</a>. You may also visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Advertising Alliance website</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative website</a> to learn more information about interest-based advertising. You may download the AppChoices app at <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s AppChoices app</a> to opt out in connection with mobile apps, or use the platform controls on your mobile device to opt out.</p>
