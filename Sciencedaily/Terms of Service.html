<p>We attempt to respond to correspondence. However, due to the high volume of mail and e-mail we receive, it is possible for a message to be missed. A lack of response does not indicate permission, approval or tacit agreement.</p>
<p>The provisions herein survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever</p>
<p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute with ScienceDaily LLC, or in any way relating to your use of ScienceDaily or NewsDaily, resides in the courts of the State of Maryland and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the State of Maryland in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving ScienceDaily or its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, contractors, telecommunication providers, and content providers.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Agreement</strong></p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions and the ScienceDaily LLC Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and ScienceDaily and its affiliates with respect to the use of the ScienceDaily, WeatherDaily and NewsDaily Site, and Content.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>No subscription fees: Personal use of ScienceDaily and affiliated sites is free of charge at this time. Therefore our policy is to never request credit card, password or other personal or financial information of site users.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Most web sites collect some sort of information about their visitors in order to gather statistics about how many visitors they get each month, what are the most and least popular pages on the web site, where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors, etc. In an effort to answer questions such as these, ScienceDaily also collects certain basic information about its visitors.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that ScienceDaily has no interest in personally identifying its users. This would be practically quite difficult, and quite an unnecessary task to accomplish anyway. The only thing that ScienceDaily is interested in is the overall statistics of its readership. Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers--upon whose support the site depends--and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our ever-increasing readership.</p>
<p>So what information does ScienceDaily collect about its visitors? Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details--if they are available--including the IP address of the visitor's computer and/or Internet service provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used.</p>
<p>In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agencies that we work with may also collect certain information through the use of banner ads.</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Advertising</em></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Cookies</em></p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
<p>If you wish not to have ScienceDaily keep any records of your visit to our site, even though it is our policy not to personally identify individual users but only to gather overall cumulative information about our visitors, then we suggest that you use an anonymous web browsing service such as Anonymizer.com. Such services typically hide all information about particular users from web sites, which log visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users' own computers.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact Dan Hogan, editor of ScienceDaily, editor@sciencedaily.com.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright and Take-Down Procedures</strong></p>
<p>If you think that any Content accessible on ScienceDaily or affiliated sites infringes on your copyright, you may request removal of those materials by e-mailing Dan Hogan, ScienceDaily's editor, at editor@sciencedaily.com. Please include "copyright question" in the subject line and the URL of the material, your name, address, phone number and e-mail address in the body of the message.</p>
<p>If you violate any of these Terms and Conditions, your permission to use the Content automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content.</p>
