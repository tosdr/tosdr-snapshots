    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Users are invited to create free workspaces that serve as a container for one or more
            applications. The resources used or planned to be used by these workspaces, as measured by the internal
            system of the platform, serve as the basis for the establishment of an automated estimate, </span><span
            class="c6">which </span><span class="c2">is then used to create a subscription. Once a subscription order
            has been confirmed by payment, the usage quotas defined in the subscription are released and become
            available to the applications of the workspace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The free workspace offers limited basic quotas for testing the platform&#39;s offer.
            These are provided free of charge by the publisher without any obligation on their part and may be changed
            at any point. The user is encouraged to subscribe to a higher level of service to ensure the sustainability
            of their work tools defined on the platform.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Workspaces that exceed the quotas set in the subscription </span><span
            class="c6">will be limited to the maximum allowed by the prepaid subscription </span><span class="c2">and
            will be upgraded once a higher subscription is purchased. Users trying to connect to an application in a
            workspace that exceeds the authorized processing capacity will see a waiting message and will be allowed to
            connect to the application only when a session space becomes available.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Workspace hosting is billed for based on the use of key resources, the use of which
            is considered an indicator of the added value of the workspace applications. T</span><span class="c6">his
            allows the platform to automatically adjust billing for most use cases.</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;However, the hosting provided is also characterized by hardware resources (in particular
            the consumed disk space, memory space, computing power, bandwidth, etc.) on which the publisher does not
            impose any limit. If the publisher finds an impact on services (in particular the quality of services to
            other users) due to abnormal use of resources, the user will be notified of the abuse and its resources may
            be limited. The user may, if necessary, and if proposed by the publisher, subscribe to an additional service
            adapted to its consumption of resources.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The platform prices are published on the pricing page (</span><span class="c10 c6"><a

                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pricing.simitless.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1666103377699901&amp;usg=AOvVaw305HqVb0DQ52Rp40Gbwe5k">https://pricing.simitless.com/</a></span><span
            class="c2">) and are subject to change depending on the evolution of the publisher&#39;s offer. The
            publisher reserves the right to modify their prices at any time, while guaranteeing the application of the
            price indicated at the time of the order for existing users. The prices appearing on the platform are prices
            in Euros excluding taxes (before VAT or other taxes), US Dollars or British Pound (GB), the applicable VAT
            or sales tax rate being that of the country of the purchasing user (in accordance with implementing
            regulation 1042 / 2013 of the European Council of October 7, 2013). The prices are also mentioned in Euros
            with all taxes included (VAT + other possible taxes) on the order finalization page, and excluding specific
            shipping costs, if applicable. For all dematerialized products shipped or supplied outside the European
            Union and/or French overseas departments and territories, the price is calculated net of tax automatically
            on the invoice. In the case where the payment manager offers the possibility of paying in a currency
            different from the currencies supported by the platform, the reference price remains the price chosen by the
            user and displayed on the platform, in EUR, USD or GBP. The subscription amount will then be adjusted
            directly by the payment manager or by the user&#39;s bank to honor the subscription. Once one of the
            currencies has been selected by the user for a workspace, it is technically very difficult to change, due to
            the functioning of the payment management systems. The publisher does not offer this possibility at the
            moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The essential characteristics, their prices and the mode of use of the services are
            made available to the user on the platform created by the publisher. In accordance with the article L112-1
            of the Consumer Code, the user is informed, by any appropriate process, of the prices and specific
            conditions of the sale and the performance of the services before any conclusion of the sales contract
            (Order page, Pricing page and Terms &amp; Conditions, both in French and English). In all cases, the total
            amount due by the user is indicated on the order confirmation page. The sale price of the services is the
            one listed on the pricing page on the day of the order, it does not include the shipping costs and taxes
            possibly invoiced in addition. These possible costs are calculated for the user and displayed during the
            sales process, and in any event at the time of confirmation of the order.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The publisher reserves the right to pass on any change in the VAT rate to the price
            of the services.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The publisher also reserves the right to modify their prices at any time. However,
            the price displayed on the day of the order will be the only one applicable to the user for the duration of
            their subscription.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Companies subject to intra-community VAT (EU VAT Law, article 4, 2.1.2) and who
            manage subscriptions on the platform are solely responsible for the reverse-charge of their VAT to the tax
            authorities of their country.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The user certifies having received the details of the fees, taxes, terms of payment,
            delivery, execution of the contract, and detailed information relating to the identity of the publisher,
            their address, telephone, and their activities in the context of this sale. The publisher takes
            responsibility to fulfill the user&#39;s order within the limits of the resources available for the
            provision of the services only. In case this proves impossible, the publisher will inform the user as soon
            as possible, if the order has been placed. In this case and f</span><span class="c6">ailing a mutual
            agreement with the user on a new delivery date, </span><span class="c2">the publisher will reimburse the
            user. A delivery typically involves only the provision of the functionality on the platform. The handling,
            configuration, and training of people to use the applications, among others, remains the responsibility of
            the user or of their reseller if a specific contract mentions it.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c14" id="h.3y8456g7c935"><span class="c12 c6">3-3 Billing and Payment</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">All subscriptions are made by bank card (credit or debit) or by SEPA direct debit (if
            activated by the payment manager according to their internal rules). The publisher uses the services of the
            Stripe payment manager (</span><span class="c10 c6"><a class="c5"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stripe.com/en/terms&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1666103377702811&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KI4b970M-QExpE-NqAbzM">https://stripe.com/en/terms</a></span><span
            class="c2">) to provide a secure online payment and billing service in accordance with European banking
            rules. Cards issued by banks domiciled outside France must be international bank cards (Mastercard or
            Visa).</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The information provided is encrypted according to the current state of the art and
            cannot be read during transport over the network. Once the payment has been initiated by the user, the
            transaction is immediately debited after verification of the information. In accordance with the provisions
            of the Monetary and Financial Code, the commitment to pay given by the card is irrevocable. By providing
            their bank information during the sale, the user authorizes the publisher to debit their card for the amount
            relating to the price indicated and any future amount as agreed in the sales page of the workspace. The user
            confirms that s/he is the legal holder of the debit card and that s/he is legally entitled to use it. In the
            event of an error, or if it is impossible to debit the card, the sale is immediately automatically resolved
            and the order canceled.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Since transmissions are made directly via Stripe in an encrypted way, the publisher
            has no access to the confidential information necessary for payment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">If the user wishes to market access to their applications, Stripe will also handle
            transactions directly between them and other users. The publisher is in no way the handler of financial
            flows.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Automatic registration systems are considered as proof of the nature, content, and
            date of the order. Stripe confirms to the user the acceptance of their order by sending a confirmation
            message to the e-mail address that they will have communicated when opening their verified account. It is up
            to the user to ensure the validity of the e-mail address communicated. Each invoice is available
            automatically in the user area.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The publisher reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order from a user and to
            interrupt the service, in particular in the event of the insolvency of the user, in the event of a default
            in the payment of the order concerned within the deadlines defined by the payment manager (5 to 15 days
            depending on the specific case), in the case of a refusal to pay for renewal, or in the case of a dispute
            relating to the payment of a previous order.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In accordance with the French commercial law articles L441-6 and D441-5, any delay in
            payment automatically entails, in addition to the late payment penalties, an obligation for the debtor to
            pay a lump sum indemnity of &euro; 40 for collection costs. Additional compensation may be claimed, on
            supporting documents, when the recovery costs incurred exceed the amount of the lump-sum
            compensation.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The user is alone responsible for the information they input while placing an order.
            Neither the publisher nor the payment manager can be held responsible for errors made by the user in the
            details of the recipient of the order (billing address in particular) and limited access to the services
            that these errors could cause.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c14" id="h.dfw1l159mif7"><span class="c12 c6">3-4 Subscription renewal</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">For more flexibility towards users, the publisher offers several types of
            subscriptions (data, files, users, etc.) as well as several renewal frequencies (one month, three months,
            six months or one year) on the platform.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The choice of each offer is left to the free will of the user creating their
            workspace and applications, according to their budgetary constraints, needs, and wishes of the subscription
            period.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Any period started is invoiced and charged in full. The renewal of the contract is
            tacit and automatic unless terminated by the user in compliance with the provisions indicated in these
            general conditions. Upon renewal, the duration of the engagement is extended for a period equivalent to the
            billing period chosen by the user.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">There is no obligation to renew or a minimum subscription period other than the
            frequency chosen by the user when ordering. As long as the renewal has not been made, the user is free to
            change the offer, by requesting and validating a new automatic quote on the platform. The user can also at
            any time change their mind after ordering and contract an offer at a lower cost. The publisher never
            reimburses the sums collected, but the platform allows the creation of credit notes in an amount equivalent
            to the proportion of time not used on the previous subscription. These credits will be automatically applied
            to any subscription contracted on the same workspace. These credits are not transferable to other users or
            other workspaces.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Payments received by the publisher are not refundable, and no refunds or credits will
            be given for periods of partial use.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c14" id="h.4kppew38ett8"><span class="c12 c6">3-5 Products and applications made available between
            users</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In some cases, users can create applications on the platform and make them available
            to some extent to other users for a fee or for free. In this case, the platform acts as a
            marketplace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">By agreement between the publisher and the users, Stripe is the payment manager in
            this case as well, and the publisher is in no way responsible for the breakdowns of cash flows. Users
            designate the platform as an application access manager. Stripe takes a commission from the price set by the
            user offering the application to get paid for their service, then takes a commission that is paid to the
            publisher to pay them for the platform&rsquo;s services. The prices are defined on the pricing page
            (</span><span class="c10 c6"><a class="c5"

            applications </span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The user offering access to their applications remains solely responsible for the
            provision of their service. They guarantee access to their applications under the conditions set on the
            access management page and the terms and conditions of sale and use when the user subscribing, buying, or
            obtaining access to the application joins the application initially.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Part of the interest of applications created using the services of the platform comes
            from the fact that these work in real-time and all modifications, additions, and deletions are done
            instantly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The user offering access, therefore, guarantees not to significantly modify the value
            of the application the access to which they sell at a certain price while they have users already subscribed
            to it. The publisher of the platform does not have the technical possibility of ensuring that this value is
            maintained but will, on a case by case basis and at its entire discretion, act as a mediation to resolve any
            conflict that may arise.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">As a seller of access to their application, the offering user must provide the
            publisher and other users with the correct credentials to contact them. The publisher will not be held
            responsible for the consequences that breaches of this obligation would have.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The user offering access to their applications is aware that the price they set for
            other users to access their applications will be the price actually paid by the subscribing users (excluding
            taxes), but that the user offering access to their applications will only receive the corresponding amount
            minus the publisher&#39;s commission and possibly the costs arising from the particular situation of the
            user.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The user offering access to their applications remains solely responsible for the
            publication of their own legal notices (a field is available in each application and in each workspace
            allowing a link to be displayed to the accessing users). It is the responsibility of the user providing
            access to check all information, invoices, invoiced amounts, etc. so that all the items produced meet local
            tax and legal requirements.</span></p>

            applications and products supplied by a user offering access to their applications</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The accessing user agrees to comply with the access levels granted to them by the
            offering user, and in particular with regard to the limits of use that may exist with regard to data,
            analysis, or visualization. Thus, it will not seek to exploit a possible defect in the services to
            improperly access certain portions of applications that were not provided by the user offering it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The accessing user will particularly respect the status of the data to which they
            have access, and will not use it in a manner that is not in accordance with the license under which the
            offering user has chosen to distribute it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The accessing user also takes responsibility to make strictly personal or internal
            use of the applications to which they have access, and not to distribute the content of the applications if
            this possibility has not been expressly granted by the user offering accesses or the owner of the
            data.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Any breach of these obligations may result in a total and immediate interruption of
            access to the platform without consideration of any current subscription, as well as the termination of the
            offending user account. The user offering access will also have the possibility of bringing an action for

            users accessing to register and/or buy access; as well as a de-referencing of the marketplace page
            application. Accessing existing users will receive an automatic notification by e-mail warning them of the
            future interruption of their access, and will not be able to renew their subscription or registration when
            it comes to an end. Once the application no longer has any active accessing users, its effective deletion by

            information, products, services, software provided on the platform, platform interruptions or failures, the

            the platform evolve accordingly. In the event of technical impossibility, the publisher will be able to
            modify the prerequisites of the platform to allow the users affected to benefit from the services as quickly

            publisher cannot be held liable in the event of payment errors or the insolvency of third-party users. Only
            Stripe, the payment manager, has access to billing data, the publisher directly including their software

            equivalent to the price paid by the user, in proportion to the downtime.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c14" id="h.an8amal4lhp"><span class="c12 c6">8-3 Data Backups</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The publisher maintains an incremental and complete backup system of the servers,
            files and data carried out. These backups are then automatically tested on the primary hosting site and then
            on a secondary secure site. All backup communications are carried out securely (SSH with authentication by
            2048 bit key and IPv6 address lock). The publisher makes a backup every 4 hours (6 versions kept), daily (7
            versions kept), weekly (4 versions kept) and monthly (6 versions kept). The publisher takes responsibility
            to restore a backup, either free of charge in the event of a technical problem attributable to the
            publisher, or as an additional service invoiced on an estimate for any other reason (in the event of
            manipulation error, malicious use, etc.). As part of the free restore of a backup, the publisher will only
            restore the entire most recent functional backup and cannot respond to requests for a partial data
            restore.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Any person of full age and fully capable of entering into a contractual relationship
            is authorized to create a user account. Minors are allowed to register for a number of services offered on
            the platform, on the express condition that they have previously obtained authorization from the person
            exercising parental authority to do so and to provide the information and addresses to which all
            communication can be forwarded to them. The fact that they register means that they have obtained this prior
            authorization. The publisher reserves the right to request written justification at any time, and to carry
            out any verifications, as well as to delete any personal account whose minor holder would not submit said
            justification within 5 days from the request, or within any other time limit.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Accounts that are not validated with a connection method (login address, password,
            etc...) are automatically deleted, as well as all their content after a period of a few days, in accordance
            with Article 10.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creation of the connection method is done via an online form, which the user
            takes responsibility to complete in a reliable and precise manner. When enabled and depending on the
            availability from service providers, it is possible to connect using an email address and password or using
            a social network account such as Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Microsoft or Twitter. In this case, the
            platform will only have access to basic information provided automatically by each of these providers and
            will use it to complete the user profile on the publisher&#39;s platform. Users choosing to use such
            accounts must comply with their respective terms of use. Subsequently, the user account can be supplemented
            with additional information intended to facilitate collaboration with other users (name, user name, profile
            picture, additional contact details, etc.). No information is provided to the service providers by the
            platform without the agreement from the user.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">If this information changes, the user agrees to modify their account and to update
            it; the publisher cannot be held responsible for incorrect information provided by users.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Access to the user account is then done by navigating to the platform and entering
            the login address and password in the corresponding fields, or by using the social network connection again.
            The user has the possibility, in case of forgetting their password, to reset their password on simple
            automated request, if the e-mail address has been previously validated by clicking on a link received during
            registration in the case of an address not pre-validated by a social network. The publisher uses a strong
            encryption system to protect the user&#39;s password and has no way of being able to access the user&#39;s
            password.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The login address/password combination is strictly personal, and the user must not
            make them available to a third party, whether voluntarily, against payment or by negligence. Failing to keep
            said combination private, the publisher cannot be held responsible for any fraudulent access to user
            accounts and to the data contained in applications and workspaces. The user is encouraged to use complex
            passwords, in particular by using at least a lowercase letter, a capital letter and a number. The addition
            of a special character is recommended, and the platform does not restrict the length of passwords or the use
            of &ldquo;password managers&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once an account is set up, workspaces can be created to allow multiple users to share
            resources, applications, and information.</span></p>

            disloyal or unfair advantages.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">If the data and information contained in the user space were to disappear following a
            technical failure or a case of force majeure, the responsibility of the platform and its publisher cannot be
            engaged, this data and information being considered as having no intrinsic value but being only
            informative.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the event of a data breach or an attack on systems (among other emergencies), it
            is common practice to invalidate all passwords and lock all user accounts. In this case, users will be
            informed without delay and will be invited to renew their passwords. This is only possible with an email
            address verified in the system. It is up to the user to ensure the validity of the e-mail address
            provided.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The pages relating to user accounts are freely printable by the account holder but do

            user through the platform are finalized with the other users of the platform. In the event of termination
            other than as a result of the direct decision of the user, the publisher may replace the user in the
            execution of the deletion of the workspaces from the account and any associated data.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Access to the account will be impossible once the termination procedure has been
            completed, and the publisher will erase the data from their active servers within a maximum period of 30
            days from the date of the end of the account termination procedure. Due to the very secure backup policy,
            extracts or a full copy of the data may be kept for up to 1 year after the deletion, in additional backup
            systems, without this data being directly accessible by anyone during normal platform and systems
