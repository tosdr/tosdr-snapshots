<br></div><div class="content-body legal w-richtext"><p>These Terms of Service (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are entered into by Smartest Edu, Inc. d/b/a Formative (“<strong>Formative</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) and you as a user of Formative’s website and/or Formative’s online, cloud-based learning platform (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”).  You acknowledge and agree that the following terms, conditions, guidelines, covenants, and notices set forth herein shall govern your access and use of the Site.</p><p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN USING THIS SITE. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, BROWSING THE SITE, USING ANY INFORMATION, PURCHASING OR RECEIVING ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND/OR SUBMITTING ANY CONTENT OR PERSONAL INFORMATION VIA THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO AND ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, DAMAGE AND REMEDY EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS, VENUE SELECTION, AND A CHOICE OF DELAWARE LAW, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO OUR <a href="http://www.formative.com/legal/privacy">PRIVACY POLICY</a>. </p><p>THESE TERMS INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THE SITE TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEEDING IN COURT. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION, AND A JURY WAIVER. </p><p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SITE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD OR OLDER AND POSSESS THE LEGAL RIGHT AND ABILITY TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS.</p><h4>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE (A) THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THESE TERMS AND (B) THAT THESE TERMS HAVE THE SAME FORCE AND EFFECT AS A SIGNED AGREEMENT.</h4><h5>1. Site Content; Reservation of Rights</h5><p>The Site is for your internal business purposes or other personal, noncommercial use only. Except as otherwise provided by a third party, all trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos (collectively, “Trademarks”) used and displayed on the Site are registered and unregistered Trademarks of Formative and/or its licensors. You acknowledge that the Trademarks used and displayed on the Site are and shall remain the sole property of Formative and/or our licensors. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons, and scripts are Trademarks and/or trade dress of Formative and/or its licensors, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Formative and/or its licensors. The Site contains copyrighted material, Trademarks, trade dress, and other proprietary content, including but not limited to, text, software, applications, sound, photographs, images, logos, video, graphics, assessments, questions, documents, written posts and comments, interactive features, and other data and information generated, provided, or otherwise or made accessible on or through the Site, and including the entire selection, coordination, arrangement, and “look and feel” of the Site (collectively, the “Content”). Neither these Terms nor your use of the Site transfers any right, title, or interest in the Site or the Content to you. Formative and its third-party licensors retain all of our and their respective right, title, and interest to the Site and Content. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. The misuse of the Trademarks displayed on the Site, or any other Content on the Site, is strictly prohibited. </p><p>Formative may use e-mail and text messages to communicate with you on a recurring basis. By providing your e-mail address and/or phone number, you consent and give permission to be contacted at such e-mail address and/or phone number by Formative for informational and/or marketing purposes. You understand that consent is not a condition of purchase. You certify that you have provided your own contact information. Message and data rates may apply. To opt-out of such communications, you may click the “unsubscribe” button in our email or reply STOP to our text message.</p><h5>2. Account and Registration; Memberships; School Partnerships</h5><p>n order to access certain features of the Site, you may be required to register for an account by entering your email and choosing a password (your “<strong>Account Credentials</strong>”). When you engage with or sign into the Site, in addition to your Account Credentials, you may be providing your name, phone number, and/or other contact information to Formative. You certify that you have provided your own contact information and that the information you have provided is accurate. Upon registration and the submission of such contact information, you consent and give permission to be contacted at such e-mail address, phone number, or other method by Formative and its partners.  </p><p>You are solely responsible for protecting and maintaining the secrecy of your Account Credentials. You shall not allow another person to use your Account Credentials to access the Site. Formative will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage that results from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You are solely responsible for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You agree to immediately notify Formative of any unauthorized use of your Account Credentials. </p><p>School partnerships are entered into between Formative and either a school or a school district that has legal authorization to share teacher and student data. Small teams may self-serve directly on the Site, but a school partnership will require written permissions and guarantees from an authorized agent of the Local Education Agency (“LEA”). If a partner school requests Formative to integrate with your Student Information System (“SIS”), Learning Management System (“LMS”), or other system in order to automatically create accounts, you may receive an email to obtain access to the account authorized by an administrator and created by Formative. If Formative becomes aware that the signatory to a school partnership did not have authority in the LEA to sign the agreement between Formative and such school, Formative reserves the right to terminate such school partnership and all related accounts.  </p><p>The Site is designed for use by schools, school districts, educators and student users.  If you are an educator, you warrant and represent that you are authorized to use the Site with your students on behalf of your school and/or school district.  If you are a school, a school district or an educator using individual accounts on behalf of your students or providing students with access to the Site, you warrant and represent that you are authorized to act on a parents’ or legal guardians’ behalf in providing such access and any student information to Formative under applicable law or that you have obtained verifiable consent from parents or legal guardians of your students in accordance to the laws governing your jurisdiction.  To the extent that any student data or personal information is being made available to Formative or to any third party (including other students), you represent and warrant that you have given all applicable notices and have received all applicable consents and have not received any effective objections thereto.  Minor students are only authorized to use the Site to the extent authorized by you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, or to the extent permitted by a parent or legal guardian. Formative reserves the right to provide access to a student’s account to the student’s parents, legal guardian, or other authorized adult or educational institution, upon such authorized adult’s request. </p><p>When you register for an account on the Site, you will have the option to choose from several types of membership plans, and Formative will make the online, cloud-based learning platform portion of the Site available to you in accordance with the type of membership plan you select. Upon registration and payment of the applicable fees for such membership plan, you will receive an email from Formative confirming registration of your selected membership plan and specifying the terms governing such membership plan, including the duration of your membership and fees due. Your use of the Site during the term of your membership plan shall be subject to these Terms and the additional terms set forth in such email. You may cancel, upgrade, or downgrade your membership at any time. If your membership ends or is cancelled, Formative will delete your data in accordance with Formative’s <a href="https://www.formative.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and data retention policy. </p><p>For certain membership plans, a credit card will be required to authorize payment at the time of registration and billing cycles will be selected and designated at the time of registration.  Billing cycles are either monthly or annually, depending on what the account holder selects. Your membership will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless you cancel your membership before the end of the then-current subscription period, which you may do at any time through the Site or by contacting Formative at the email address set forth in the “Contact Information” section below. Any cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. No refund will be issued for the current billing cycle.  If you do not provide notice of non-renewal, you hereby authorize Formative to charge the then-current renewal fees to the credit card associated with your account. As and to the extent required by the jurisdiction applicable to you, Formative will provide notice to you prior to the automatic renewal of your subscription.   </p><p>You will pay Formative the fees specified in the membership plan for which you have subscribed, and Formative reserves the right to change the fees at any time upon notice to you. Payments are due upon receipt of invoice. Late payments are subject to an interest charge, which is the lower of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum legal rate. You are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with these Terms or your use of the Site (other than the taxes based on Formative’s net income). If Formative is required to pay any such taxes, you will, upon receipt of our invoice, reimburse us for any taxes paid by Formative. All payments for both individual teacher subscriptions and school partnerships are considered final and are not eligible for refund. If you have any billing issues or questions, you must notify Formative in writing by email or support chat within five (5) calendar days of the issue being addressed. Any billing issues older than five (5) calendar days will not be considered. </p><h5>3. Limited Right to Use; User Conduct</h5><p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant to you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, non-assignable, and revocable license to access and use the Site solely for your internal business purposes or other non-commercial use.

All Posting of User Content is your sole and exclusive responsibility. Formative merely provides a forum for the transmission and dissemination of User Content. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MUST EVALUATE AND BEAR ALL RISK RELATED TO THE USE AND TRANSMISSION OF USER CONTENT TO FORMATIVE. FORMATIVE SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY MAY TAKE BASED ON USER CONTENT. Formative has no responsibility or liability for any disputes, communications, or issues between you and your end users and customers. </p><p>You acknowledge that Formative does not pre-screen or approve any of User Content and has no obligation to monitor User Content. However, to the extent permitted by law, Formative reserves the right to review, modify (for formatting and editing purposes), remove or delete any of User Content at its discretion as needed to provide the Site.

IN ADDITION, THE SITE MAY BE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE FROM TIME TO TIME FOR MAINTENANCE OR OTHER REASONS. FORMATIVE DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE SITE OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY SITES. </p><p>Please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties and conditions, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you but shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p><h5>11.

The arbitration shall be conducted before three neutral arbitrators in the State of Delaware, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as then in effect. No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. Except for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law. The parties shall equally share all AAA charges and fees associated with the arbitration. </p><p>BECAUSE THE USE OF THE SITE REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATORS’ DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. </p><p>The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware, or to any federal court located within the State of Delaware for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim, or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any action by registered mail or any other means provided by law. Should this Section 10 be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, it shall be severed and the parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in the state or federal courts having jurisdiction over the State of Delaware.</p><h5>14.
