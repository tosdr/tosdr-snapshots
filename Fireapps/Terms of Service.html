<p>15.2 You acknowledge and agree that FireApps has the right, at any time and for any reason, to redesign or modify the FireApps Materials and other elements of the Services or any part thereof.</p>

The updated version of these Terms will supersede all prior versions. Your acceptance: Following such notice, your continued access or use of the Services on or after the effective date of the changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of any updates. If you do not agree to any updates, you should stop using the Services.

<p>15.6 Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be considered as granting any rights to third parties.
