<h3>Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions</h3>
<p>Any sweepstakes, contests or other promotions (“Promotions”) that may be offered via the Site will be governed by a separate set of rules that, in addition to describing such Promotions, may have eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions governing the Promotions, use of submissions you make, and disclosures about how your personal information may be used. It is your responsibility to read such rules to determine whether or not you are eligible and want to participate, register and/or enter, and to determine the applicable terms and conditions of the Promotions. By participating in any Promotions, you will become subject to those official rules, and you agree to comply with and abide by such rules and the decisions of the sponsor(s) identified therein, which shall be final and binding in all respects.</p>

Your use of this Site to enter into such transactions with us is entirely voluntary.

In addition, third parties may retain cached copies of your Information.</p>
<h3>Password Policy</h3>
<p>Your use of certain portions of the Site requires a User ID and password. Anyone with knowledge of your User ID and password can gain access to the restricted portions of this Site and the information available to you. Accordingly, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User ID and password, and for restricting access to your computer, or other device you use to connect to the Site, so that others may not access the Site using your User ID and password. By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree to be solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your respective User ID and password, as well as for any communications entered through the Sites using your User ID and password. You agree to immediately notify Draper and Kramer if you become aware of any loss or theft of your User ID and password or any unauthorized use of your User ID and password, and further agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your User ID and password until such time as you notify us that your User ID and password have been compromised or otherwise request that we cancel your account. Draper and Kramer shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your negligence or failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to delete or change a User ID and/or password at any time and for any reason.</p>

<h3>User Content and Submissions</h3>
<p>You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, advertisements, messages or other materials submitted, posted or displayed by a User on or through any Site (“User Content”) is the sole responsibility of the person from which such User Content originated. Draper and Kramer claims no ownership or control over any User Content. You or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any User Content you submit, post or display on or through Draper and Kramer and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through Draper and Kramer, you grant Draper and Kramer a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content through Draper and Kramer. In addition, by submitting, posting or displaying User Content which is intended to be available to the general public, you grant Draper and Kramer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content for the purpose of promoting Draper and Kramer services. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display or transmit any User Content in its sole discretion.

If you post User Content in any public area of any Site, you also permit any User to access, display, view, store and reproduce such User Content for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such User Content placed on any Site retains any and all rights that may exist in such User Content. Draper and Kramer acts as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of User Content and has no obligation to screen User Content, communications or information in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring User Content posted by Users. However, Draper and Kramer may review and remove any User Content that, in its sole judgment, violates these Terms and Conditions, violates applicable laws, rules or regulations, is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal, or violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, users. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to expel Users and prevent their further access to the Sites and/or use of the Services for violating the Terms and Conditions or applicable laws, rules or regulations. Draper and Kramer may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for Draper and Kramer, damage Draper and Kramer’s brand or public image, or cause Draper and Kramer to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers. Draper and Kramer does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of User Content or any other communications posted by users or endorse any opinions expressed by users.

<h3>Policy Regarding Termination of Users Who Infringe the Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Rights of Others</h3>
<p>Draper and Kramer, and all of its affiliated companies respect the intellectual property of others, and Draper and Kramer asks Users and content partners to do the same. The unauthorized posting, reproduction, copying, distribution, modification, public display or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes infringement of the copyright owner’s rights. As a condition to your use of the Sites, you agree not to use any Site to infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way. Draper and Kramer may terminate the accounts of any User, and block access to the Sites of any User who infringes the copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, of others. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to take these actions at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, and without any liability to the User who is terminated or to the User whose access is blocked.</p>
<h3>Draper and Kramer’s Liability</h3>
<p>Draper and Kramer does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on the Sites. Draper and Kramer is not involved in the actual communications between Draper and Kramer users. As a result, Draper and Kramer has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on the Sites. In addition, note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through the Sites. By its very nature, other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, Draper and Kramer cannot and does not confirm that each user is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of participants on any Site, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Draper and Kramer (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>
<h3>Events Beyond Draper and Kramer’s Control</h3>
<p>You expressly absolve and release Draper and Kramer from any claim of harm resulting from a cause beyond Draper and Kramer’s control, including, but not limited to, the failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems, computer viruses, unauthorized access, theft, operator errors, severe weather, earthquakes, or natural disasters, strikes or other labor problems, wars, or governmental restrictions.</p>
<h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>
<p>WHILE DRAPER AND KRAMER ENDEAVORS TO PROVIDE THE MOST ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE MATERIALS AVAILABLE, THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. MOREOVER, DRAPER AND KRAMER MAY MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND/OR CHANGES IN THIS SITE OR IN THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THIS SITE AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON.

BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TOTAL LIABILITY FOR DRAPER AND KRAMER FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THIS SITE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $100 US DOLLARS.</p>
<h3>Submissions</h3>

You hereby waive any claim to the contrary.</p>

<h3>Term and Termination</h3>

Draper and Kramer reserves the right at any time and for any reason to deny you access to the Site or any portion thereof, and to terminate this Agreement.

Even after you are no longer a User of the Sites, certain provisions of these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect.</p>
