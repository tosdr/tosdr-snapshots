<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 1) Your Personal Information</h3>
<div>
<p><p>Payment information is required in order to process your credit card. Our shopping cart (Dansie Cart) tracks your IP address or Cookies, IP address and unique computer information solely for the purpose of tracking and fulfilling your order. Your billing information is entered into our billing system/crm and remains encrypted at all times. We use Freshbooks.com for our billing system. We do use &lsquo;logs&rsquo; to analyze statistics locally. Cloudflare does statics as well and is a third party we trust. We may add your email address to our &lsquo;customer mailing list&rsquo; software: mailchimp.com which can be easily opted out of. We rarely ever send out a mailing. We do not share or sell your personal information other than what is listed above in order to operate our business. That is the extent of your personal information and how we use it to function as a business.</p></p>
</div>
<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 2) Account Setup</h3>
<div>
<p><p>We will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) incase of fraud. It is your responsibility to provide us with a working email address. You may receive a phone call within a 24-48 hour period to determine your identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
</div>
<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 3) Content</h3>
<div>
<p><p>All services provided by us may only be used for lawful purposes. This includes, but not limited to: copyrighted material, material we judge to be threatening or obscene, pornography. <strong>Adult related content is NOT allowed.</strong>&nbsp; Common sense movie rating system with regard to &ldquo;Adult&rdquo; related content. <span style="color: #ff0000;">PG13 and below</span> is acceptable.&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">R and above is NOT acceptable</span>.</p>
<p>Examples of unacceptable material:<br/>Pornography of any sort.<br/>IRC Bots<br/>Warez Sites<br/>Pirated Software<br/>Hate sites<br/>Hack programs and archives<br/>Content &ldquo;we&rdquo; personally deem to be unacceptable.<br/><br/><strong>WE DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
</div>
<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 4) Zero Tolerance Spam Policy</h3>
<div>
<p><p>We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail, bulk emailing, and spam. &ldquo;Safe lists&rdquo; and &ldquo;double optin&rdquo; will be treated as spam. Any user who sends out spam will have their account terminated without notice. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you wish to send out bulk emails either solicited or unsolicited, you must first contact us and get authorization of said resource usage of our servers.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mass/bulk email definition:</span></strong><br/>Any email addressed to 10 or more people with identical content. (sent over and over is considered bulk/mass mail) The exception to this rule is when you have 10 or more employees in an organization and you need to send out a notice to said employees. You do have unlimited use of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; email communications. Mass/bulk email is not &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">AOL ACCOUNT HOLDERS READ:</span></strong><br/>AOL has implemented an anti spam capability that allows you to mark messages as spam within your aol email account. Emails that you setup as forwarders for your hosting account that get forwarded to your aol email address, if you mark them as &ldquo;spam&rdquo;, will cause aol to tag &ldquo;Stormer Hosting&rdquo; as the last known &ldquo;source&rdquo; of the spam and not the originator of the spam. DO NOT use the aol anti spam option if you are going to forward your email to your aol account. If you do so and AOL blocks the servers of Stormer Hosting, your account will be immediately suspended, if not terminated for ABUSE. A clean up fee may be required for said abuse.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to require changes or disable as necessary any web site, account, database, or other component that does not comply with this policy, at its sole discretion. We also reserves the right to make any such modifications in an emergency at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to charge the holder of the account used to send any unsolicited OR solicited e-mails a clean up fee. This cost of the clean up fee is left entirely to the discretion of Stormer Hosting as cost may vary depending on the abuse.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YAHOO, SBCGLOBAL, ATT, BELLSOUTH, EARTHLINK, AOL, COX, HOTMAIL, CHARTER, ROADRUNNER, VERIZON:</strong></span><br/>These companies randomly and without notice can and will block email you forward to these email accounts. It is their attempt to block spam that may be forwarded to their mail servers. The only guarantee of receipt of email is if you pop your email directly off our mail server and NOT forward your email to your ISP.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="88f1e7fdc8f1e7fdfaece7e5e9e1e6a6ebe7e5">[email&#160;protected]</a> forwarding email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e79e8892a786888bca9e868f8888ca948584808b8885868bcaaeb4b7c984888a">[email&#160;protected]</a> address.</p>
<p>Mail services such as GMail are an excellent alternative if you must foward your email as it will NOT block any email you forward to those accounts. (UPDATE: they have started to block individual emails that are spammy, but not mail servers) Mail forwarders can then be setup to forward to your ISP from Gmail if you insist on forwarding your email to your ISP email account.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="532a3c26132a3c2621373c3e323a3d7d303c3e">[email&#160;protected]</a> forwarding email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e0998f95a0878d81898cce838f8d">[email&#160;protected]</a> which then forwards to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="daa3b5af9abbb5b6f4b9b5b7">[email&#160;protected]</a> .</p>
<p>We do NOT allow email forwarders @yourdomain to forward to ANY of the ISPs listed above. We can configure them manually for you upon request, but reserve the right to disable that forwarder should the ISP start blocking our mail servers. We do not block your normal email correspondence to and from these ISPs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RBL &ndash; REAL TIME BLACKLIST</span></strong><br/>We use the services of http://www.spamhaus.org on our servers to block spammers. No other type of spam blocking occures unless you are paying for one of the Anti-Spam mail services offerred on Stormer Hosting website. Why do we use them? This keeps our servers from coming under common &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; attacks by known spamer IP addresses. Spammers have been known to send email to litterally thousands of different combinations @yourdomain.com in an attempt to find valid addresses. The use of spamhaus.org prevents many of these types of attacks. Failure to use their services may impact the performance of your hosting account and increase complaints about &ldquo;spam&rdquo; being delivered to inboxes on the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 5) Payment Information</h3>
<div>
<p><p>You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from us, in advance of the time period during which such services are provided.

<p>We reserve the right to change the monthly, quarterly and annual payment amount and any other charges at anytime without notice. We will attempt to give notice, but no guarantee of said notice is promised.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Charge Backs on Credit Cards:</strong></span> If you do not, in good faith &ldquo;first&rdquo; try to call or contact us and you do a charge back, your account will be immediately suspended if not terminated. It is only courteous to simply &ldquo;call&rdquo; and let us know you have a dispute. Our phone number is clearly listed on your credit card statement. We &ldquo;can&rdquo; solve the dispute for you MUCH FASTER. We can simply VOID or CREDIT the amount back to your card. Doing a charge back is RUDE and is an unacceptable means of doing business. We &ldquo;can&rdquo; be contacted. If a charge back is processed and you wish to reactivate your account, a late fee of 25.00 will be charged and a charge back fee of 25.00 will be processed.</p>

<p>Email invoices will be sent from:<br/><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ddaea9b2afb0b8af9daea9b2afb0b8afb5b2aea9b4b3baf3beb2b0">[email&#160;protected]</a><br/><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e131f17121a1b1217081b0c073e180c1b0d161c1111150d501d1113">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
<p>You should white list those email addresses so it is not considered spam.</p>
<p>It is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">your responsibility</span></strong> to keep your contact information up to date so that you can be notified of of a payment due. A ground mail invoice and an email invoice will be generated on the 1st of each month an annual renewal is due. You will receive 3 additional email reminders for a total of 5 notifications. After which your account may be suspended or terminated without further notice. A 25.00 reactivation or late fee may apply to continue services. Any payment made via check or online via credit card or paypal will generate an email notification that your payment has been received.</p>

<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 8) Resource Usage</h3>
<div>
<p><p><strong>Users may not initiate the following:</strong></p>
<p>a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, MySQL, HTTP, etc.</p>
<p>b) Run any type of interactive real-time chat applications that require server resources. Remotely-hosted services are fully allowed.</p>
<p>c) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.</p>

<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 9) Bandwidth & Quota Usage</h3>
<div>
<p><p>You are allocated a generous monthly bandwidth and quota allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount the server will automatically suspend the account (if bandwidth quota exceeded) until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more resources are purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused bandwidth in one month cannot be carried over to the next month. As a general rule, we will upgrade your account to the next high level and send out a prorated invoice to prevent any interruption of your services.</p>
<p>We do not offer &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; bandwidth.&nbsp; We do not offer unlimited bandwidth because we want to ensure that all accounts operate at peak performance. Those that use more, should pay more.&nbsp; This also allows us to identify accounts that may need to be upgraded or migrated to separate accounts to increase their performance and the performance of others on the same server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
</div>
<h3 style="background-color: white; color: #133c56; font-weight: bold;margin-left:3px;"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-down" style="color:#1D83C5;"></span>&nbsp; 10) Money Back Guarantee</h3>

<p>Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you&rsquo;ve had an account with us before, cancelled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.</p>
<p>There is no money back guarantee on any other plan or service.</p>
