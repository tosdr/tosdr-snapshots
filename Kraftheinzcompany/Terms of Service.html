                        <p>All we ask in return is that you abide by the Terms and Conditions that follow. Please read them carefully, because <b>when you use our sites, you automatically agree to them.</b></p>
                        
                        <p><b>Thanks for visiting!</b></p>
                        
                        <h3>RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR USE OF THE MATERIALS IN OUR SITES</h3>
                        
                        <p>(1) You agree not to re-use material from this website or from any other site operated by Kraft Heinz (each a “Site”). In particular, you agree not to copy, distribute, republish, reproduce, upload, post, or transmit anything, in any form or by any means, unless a feature on our site specifically gives you permission (like our Pin It function) or you get our written consent first.</p>
                        
                        <p>There's one exception: you may download material onto one computer for your personal, non-commercial use only, provided you don't delete or change any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices. </p>
                        
                        <p>But please don't modify the materials or use them for any other purpose; if you do, you'll be violating our intellectual property rights. </p>
                        
                        <p>(2) Everything on the Site or that you download &ndash; all text, images, and other materials on the Site, the software, plus all files, all images incorporated in or generated by the software, and all data accompanying it -- is considered licensed to you by Kraft Heinz for your personal use.  This material is protected by law, including U.S. copyright laws and international treaties.</p>
                        
                        <p>That means that we retain full and complete title to the Site and to all of the associated intellectual property rights. So you're not allowed to redistribute or sell the material -- or to “mirror” any materials on the Site, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise convert it to any other form that people can use.  Additionally, you’re not allowed to use the Site for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Site, or interfere with anyone else’s use and enjoyment of the Site.  Specifically, you may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site through hacking, password mining, or any other means.</p>
                        
                        <h3>IF YOU SUBMIT MATERIAL TO US... </h3>
                        
                        <p>(1)	All concepts, suggestions, ideas, or other recommendations that you communicate to Kraft Heinz through this Site in any format (an “Idea Submission”) becomes and remains our property, even if this agreement is later terminated. </p>

                            <li>If we use your Idea Submission -- or anything like them -- we don't have to pay you or anyone else for them.</li>
                            <li>We will have exclusive ownership of all present and future rights to Idea Submissions of every kind. We can use them for any purpose, without compensating you or anyone else for them.</li>

Kraft Heinz does not guarantee that you will have any recourse through Kraft Heinz to edit or delete any content you have submitted.  Kraft Heinz is not responsible for screening or monitoring any Content Submissions made on this Site by users. If notified by a user of a Content Submission allegedly in violation of these Terms and Conditions, we may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and our sole discretion whether to remove the Content Submission.

                        <p>(4) For all Content Submissions to Kraft Heinz, you represent and warrant that:</p>

                            <li>use of the content you supply does not violate these Terms of Use and will not cause injury to any person or entity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>You further agree and warrant that you shall not submit any content:</p>

                        <p>(5) You agree to indemnify and hold Kraft Heinz (and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees and third-party service providers), harmless from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of a breach of your representations and warranties set forth above, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>
                        
                        <p>(6)  By submitting your email address in connection with your rating and review, or any other item you submit to us, you agree that Kraft Heinz and its third party service providers may use your email address to contact you about the status of your review and other administrative purposes.</p>

                        <p>We hope you enjoy the information and materials on our Site.  We’re glad when you link to them or post them on your social media accounts, but only for your personal use.  You’re not permitted to post or upload any of our Site content for your commercial, business, or non-personal use.  If you use or post our Site information and materials for any non-personal purposes, you’ll be violating our intellectual property rights.  Also, make sure that your social media account permits you to post third party content.</p>
                        
                        <h3>INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH &amp; WELLNESS</h3>
                        
                        <p>Information accessible on this Site is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Information is often general in nature and may be helpful to some persons but not others, depending upon their personal medical needs. Above all, you should always consult with your personal physician prior to changing or undertaking a new diet or exercise program. Your physician is often in the best position to evaluate whether any particular diet or exercise program is best for you. Advance consultation with your physician is particularly important if you are under eighteen (18) years old, pregnant, nursing, or have health problems. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this site.</p>

                        <p>It's very important for you to read the next two sections carefully -- so important, in fact, that the law actually requires us to put this material in capital letters.</p>
                        
                        <p>KRAFT HEINZ WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY THAT ACCOMPANY OR RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF ITS SITES. THESE INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY...</p>

                        <p>We sometimes provide access to other websites from our Sites. But we don't endorse or approve any products or information offered at sites you reach through our Site. Check the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address provided in your browser to see if you are still in a Kraft Heinz-operated Site or have moved to another site.</p>
                        
                        <h3>SECURITIES OF THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY</h3>
                        
                        <p>We are not providing investment advice through this Site and the material on this Site should not be regarded as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities of The Kraft Heinz Company.  If you decide to use any material available on the Site in assessing whether to buy or sell securities of The Kraft Heinz Company, please be aware that the material on the Site reflects past performance and historical information only and that such performance and information is not necessarily an indication of future performance.</p>
                        
                        <h3>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h3>
                        
                        <p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This website may be considered to contain such "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of a company.</p>
                        
                        <p>Words or phrases such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "targets," "goal," "will likely result," "will continue," and similar expressions used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify such forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements are management's present expectations regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and Kraft Heinz is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any such obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
                        
                        <p>Kraft Heinz's actual results could differ materially from management's expectations and anticipated results because of changes in such factors. Some of the factors that also could cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, sales, earnings and volume growth, competitive conditions, production costs (including energy, transportation and distribution costs), currency valuations, global economic and industry conditions, achieving cost savings programs, success of acquisitions and divestitures, new product and packaging innovations, the impact of e-commerce and e-procurement, supply chain efficiency and cash flow initiatives, and other factors described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition, Kraft Heinz's overall strategy, including its financial strategy, its growth of operations, the maintenance of its financial ratios and similar matters could be adversely affected by increased interest rates, failure to meet earnings expectations, significant acquisitions or other transactions and changes in Kraft Heinz's strategies and intentions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>JURISDICTION</h3>
