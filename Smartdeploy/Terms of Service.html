INTRODUCTION<br/></b>Welcome to the SmartDeploy Web site. PDQ Corporation (“PDQ”) makes available a variety of resources (collectively the “Services”) through this site. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the following Privacy Policy, which may be revised from time to time in our sole discretion.PDQ  is committed to protecting your privacy and to giving you the most powerful and secure online experience. On occasion, we ask you for information about yourself to provide services that you request. This Privacy Policy explains data collection and use in those situations. We encourage you to read the complete Privacy Policy.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>B. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br/></b>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you. Personal information collected by the SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled site often is limited to email address, name, company or organization, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a Service. We generally request personal information when you are asked to register before downloading evaluation software, ordering email newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering PDQ products. When you download and install a product, we may ask you to register the software electronically to receive an evaluation license. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any other personal information you may already have given us. This is your personal profile.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>C. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:<br/></b>We use your personal information for four primary purposes:</p><ol class="rich-text-ol-list" data-testid="rich-text-config-ol-list"><li class="rich-text-list-item" data-testid="rich-text-config-list-item"><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph">To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.</p></li><li class="rich-text-list-item" data-testid="rich-text-config-list-item"><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph">To help you find software, Services or information on our site.</p></li><li class="rich-text-list-item" data-testid="rich-text-config-list-item"><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph">To relieve you from having to provide your personal information more than once.</p></li><li class="rich-text-list-item" data-testid="rich-text-config-list-item"><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph">To notify you by email about product upgrades, updated information, special offers new Services, and content and marketing materials that are relevant to you</p></li></ol><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph">You may unsubscribe at any time from such mailings by following the instructions at the bottom of our emails. Except as provided below, PDQ will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law, subpoena, court order or other legal process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PDQ and its family of Web sites, and (c) protect the personal safety of users of PDQ, its Web sites, or the public. Sometimes we hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, answering customer questions about products or services, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>D. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br/></b>PDQ has security measures in place to attempt to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information under our control. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Except under conditions explained above, your personal information is never shared outside the company. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or any other country where PDQ, its affiliates or agents are located. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your personal information. Please take care when using and storing it. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>E. HOW WE USE “COOKIES” AND “WEB BEACONS” AND “APIS”<br/></b>In addition to the personal information that we collect when you register, we also collect anonymous information passively using “cookies” or “Web beacons.” This helps to ensure we are publishing content customers need and want. We do not track individuals’ use of the site. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the site. A cookie will not allow the site to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your Web browser, which in turn helps us deliver products and Services more efficiently, prevent others from using your account, measure statistics such as audience size and traffic patterns and display advertisements. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. Web beacons, also known as clear GIF technology, or action tags, are small images which we may place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters which assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a SmartDeploy.com web page, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled web page. We do not use this technology to access your personal information on any site; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about PDQ Web site usage. We do not share tracking information outside of PDQ, and do not allow other companies to place Web beacons on our sites. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled Web site, you still will be able to view the text on the screens. However you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the Service offerings on the site. When registering on the website, we may use APIs to verify your identity. These APIs can collect hardware and software information, such as device and application data and the results of integrity checks, and send that data to the API provider for analysis.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>F. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION<br/></b>The SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled site does not publish content that is targeted to children.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>G. CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT<br/></b>PDQ will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. For material changes to this Policy, PDQ will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the Web site.</p><p class="rich-text-paragraph tw-mb-4 tw-text-md" data-testid="rich-text-config-paragraph"><b>H.

HOW WE USE “COOKIES” AND “WEB BEACONS” AND “APIS”\n","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"In addition to the personal information that we collect when you register, we also collect anonymous information passively using “cookies” or “Web beacons.” This helps to ensure we are publishing content customers need and want. We do not track individuals’ use of the site. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the site. A cookie will not allow the site to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your Web browser, which in turn helps us deliver products and Services more efficiently, prevent others from using your account, measure statistics such as audience size and traffic patterns and display advertisements. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. Web beacons, also known as clear GIF technology, or action tags, are small images which we may place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters which assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a SmartDeploy.com web page, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled web page. We do not use this technology to access your personal information on any site; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about PDQ Web site usage. We do not share tracking information outside of PDQ, and do not allow other companies to place Web beacons on our sites. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled Web site, you still will be able to view the text on the screens. However you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the Service offerings on the site. When registering on the website, we may use APIs to verify your identity. These APIs can collect hardware and software information, such as device and application data and the results of integrity checks, and send that data to the API provider for analysis.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"F.
