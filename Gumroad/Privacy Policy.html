Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2><h3>What are cookies?</h3><p>Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p><p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers or business partners to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p><h3>Cookies we use</h3><p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong> - These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</li><li><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong> - These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make when you use our Sites. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Site.</li><li><strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies</strong> - These cookies collect information about traffic to our Sites and about how individuals use our Sites. The information gathered may include the types of information described above in the section titled “Information automatically collected.” We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Site, and improve the Site. We use Google Analytics, Optimizely, and New Relic for this purpose. These parties use their own cookies. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a>, and about how Google protects your data here: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a>.

The social network will record that you have done this. Social networks use their own cookies.</li><li><strong>Targeted and advertising cookies</strong> - These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us and third-party advertising networks to deliver ads that may be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests or browsing behavior. Based on the cookies that the third-party advertising network sets on our Site and other sites, advertisers can display advertisements that may be relevant to your interests on our Site and while you are on third party websites. You can choose to disable cookies, as described below, or to opt out of the use of your browsing behaviour for purposes of targeted advertising. For opt out instructions, please review the “Targeted online advertising” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.&quot;</li></ul><h3>Disabling cookies</h3><p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” menus). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.</p><p>For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p><p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.</p><h3>Other technologies</h3><p>In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology, pixel tags, and software development kits (or SDKs) to collect information automatically.</p><h4>Flash Technology</h4><p>We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (“LSOs”)) on our Site to collect and store information about your use of our Site. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at this website. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel at this website and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Site.</p><h4>Pixel tags</h4><p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Site and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively. </p><h4>Software Development Kits</h4><p>Our mobile applications may use software development kits (“SDKs”) provided by third parties. SDKs enable us to provide features and functionality developed by third-party developers, including to provide us with analytics, social media integration, and advertising. The SDKs we use may enable third parties to collect information about the users of our mobile applications. The types of SDKs we use include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Analytics SDKs.</strong> These SDKs are used to collect information about use of our mobile applications. The information gathered may include the types of information described above in the section titled “Information automatically collected.” We use this information to help operate our mobile applications more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on and within the application, diagnose errors, and improve the mobile application.</li><li><strong>Social Media SDKs.</strong> These SDKs help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using our mobile application, such as by sharing content with the social network and other features you use with the social network. Social networks may also work with our apps for analytics or advertising purposes, as discussed above.</li><li><strong>Advertising SDKs.</strong> These SDKs allow our advertising partners to collect information about your devices, and how you use our mobile application and other sites and applications over time; and to use this information to show you ads of potential interest and measure how the ads perform. These third parties’ collection, use, and sharing of your personal information is subject to their own privacy policies. You may be able to control or limit use of certain information collected through advertising SDKs for purposes of targeted advertising. For additional information, please review the “Targeted online advertising” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><p>We maintain a list of SDKs used in our App here: <a href="https://help.gumroad.com/article/280-create-application-api" target="_blank">http://help.gumroad.com/326594-what-sdks-are-used-in-your-mobile-applications</a>.</p><h2>4.

Account Protection</h2><p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Gumroad password to anyone. If you do share your password or your Personal Data with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.

Security</h2><p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
