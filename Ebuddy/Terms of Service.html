      The above limitation of liability in this paragraph shall cease to apply if and insofar as the loss is due to eBuddy’s willful intent or gross negligence.
      As some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations as established above, some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. In that event the liability will be limited as far as legally possible under the applicable legislation.

      eBuddy may at any time, without prior notice to you, terminate the agreement between you and eBuddy by suspending, restricting or terminating your access to the Service at any time for any reason. Furthermore, eBuddy has the right to terminate any eBuddy Services if eBuddy determines in its sole discretion or has good faith that the use of the eBuddy service is unlawful and/or prohibited by these Terms of Use. eBuddy reserves the right to cancel user accounts that have been inactive for an extended period of time.
      You are entitled to terminate the agreement between you and eBuddy at any time by discontinuing the use of the Service and/or to terminate your eBuddy ID.
