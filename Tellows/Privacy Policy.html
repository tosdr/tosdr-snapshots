<ul class="terms" style="list-style-type: none;padding-left: 0;">
    <li>General</li>
    At tellows, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. To
    better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining of our online information practices, including how we
    collect and use the information you may provide to us on the website, and the choices you can make about the way
    your information is collected and used. With regard to your personal data, we observe the German Federal Data
    Protection Act (BDSG), the German Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Teleservices Data Protection Act (TDDSG)
    and the data protection regulations of the European Union.
    <br><br>
    This disclaimer refers only to our sites. Third parties might offer hyperlinks to other websites which may have
    information policies and practices different from ours. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy
    policies, practices, or the content of any third party websites. Once you’ve left our websites via such a link or by
    clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site
    to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.
    <br><br>
    Personal data are single details about personal or factual circumstances of a certain or a definable natural person.
    Information that can identify a person or make him identifiable.
    <br><br>
    Hereafter, we will explain what information is collected and for what purpose.

    <li>Data Collection and Processing</li>
    We hereby confirm that the collection, processing and use of personal data is done in compliance with all data
    protection regulations and is in adherence with the laws mentioned above, specifically the GDPR Art. 6 s. 1 a and
    the CCPA alongside the other data protection laws of California. This means we only process data in case of
    legitimate interest according to Art. 6 s. 1 f GDPR (e.g. for analysis, optimization and protection of the tellows
    online offerings) or under permission of processing by the user (e.g. accepting requests).
    <br><br>
    We have technical (e.g. SSL encryption), contractual (e.g. data processing agreement) and organizational measures
    (e.g. access restrictions) in place to ensure that the rules of the GDPR are abided by and that data is secure from
    access and manipulation.
    <br><br>
    It is possible to access our website without offering any personal information. We have also taken measures to
    anonymize (see paragraph Google Analytics), i.e. an analysis data acquisition only serves to improve our offerings
    and does not allow for any inferences about individuals.
    <br><br>
    We process the following categories of data which are relevant for using the tellows website and services or are
    necessary for contacting:

    <ul>
        <li>master data (e.g. name)</li>
        <li>contact data (e.g. phone number, email)</li>
        <li>content entry data (e.g. text/ comment entry, access times)</li>
        <li>meta data (e.g. IP address)</li>
    </ul>

    <li id="delete">Deletion of tellows account and associated comments</li>
    If you have created a tellows account, you can delete it at any time. To do so, log in to your <a
        href="/memberarea">member area.</a><br />    In the menu "Settings" you find "Delete data and account". You can remove your account and the ratings you have
    created.

    <li>Cooperation with Third Parties</li>
    The transmission of data to third parties only happens in accordance with the legal requirements. We only pass on
    data to third parties under permission in accordance with Art. 6 s. 1 a GDPR or on the basis of justified interest
    according to Art. 6 s. 1 f GDPR in effective and economical operations in our business.
    <br><br>
    Approval of information processing by third parties is given on the basis of a signed contract DAV/DPA (data
    processing contract) as per Art. 28 GDPR.

    <li>Transmission to Third Countries</li>
    The transmission or processing of data to third countries (i.e. outside the EEA (European Economic Area)), with
    express consent, only occurs if it fulfills a legal obligation or is of justified interest to us. E.g. in using the
    services of third parties. In this case, the data processing is based on the fact that the EU Commission has
    determined that a level of data protection similar to that in the EU exists, you have given us your declaration of
    consent or we have agreed to the standard contractual clauses for the protection of your data with the provider.

    <li>Personal Data (Logfiles)</li>
    We collect and save information in log files in accordance with Art. <a
        href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/DSGVO/6.html">6</a> s. 1 f GDPR (e.g. to resolve cases of misuse or scamming),
    that your browser automatically transfers to us after requests. The following data is collected:
    <ul>
        <li>Referrer URL (the page from which tellows was accessed)</li>
        <li>Browser type/ -version</li>
        <li>Used operating system</li>
        <li>Web pages viewed during the visit at tellows</li>
        <li>IP address (host name of the accessing computer)</li>
        <li>Date and time of server request</li>
        <li>Transferred data volume</li>
        <li>Requesting provider</li>
    </ul>
    All of this data is subject to a special protection in accordance with the regulations under data protection law,
    which we at tellows and its corresponding applications guarantee through technical and obligatory measures. This
    data cannot be assigned to any particular person. Merging of this data with other data sources will not be done.
    <br>
    For security reasons, log file information is stored for a maximum duration of 7 days and then deleted. We reserve
    the right to store IP addresses for a longer period for law enforcement purposes in the event of a violation of our
    terms of use.

    <li>Use of Cookies</li>
    <p><b>You can revoke the use of cookies by clicking on the "Cookie setting" link at the bottom of each page on which
        advertising is loaded.</b></p>
    We use so-called cookies to allocate your requests from the internet. These small files are automatically stored on
    your hard drive by your browser for the duration of your stay on our website and are necessary for the accurate use
    of our website. You can delete the cookies after finishing your stay at our website with certain configurations in

    <li>Use of Google Analytics</li>
    tellows uses Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., (“Google”), 1600
    Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    Web analysis is the collection, storage and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web
    analysis service collects data including from which website an affected person has come to a website (so-called
    referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which length of stay a subpage was
    viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of online advertising.
    We only use Google Analytics with active IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users Google within
    member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement from the European Economic Area
    will be shortened. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and
    shortened there.
    Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are stored on your computer and make it
    possible for us to analyse your use of this website. The information about your use of this website that is
    generated by means of a cookie is, in most cases, transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
    However, if IP anonymization is activated on this website and you are located in a member state of the European
    Union or in another contracting state to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, your IP address will first be
    shortened by Google.
    Only in exceptional cases will your complete IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened
    there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website in order to analyze your use of
    this website, compile reports on website activities, and render further services related to website and internet
    usage for the operator of this website.
    In the event that personal data is transferred to the USA, corresponding EU standard contracts (adequate guarantee
    for data processing in non-European countries) have been concluded with Google LLC. The EU standard contractual
    clauses used can be accessed via the URL <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087</a>.
    The IP address provided by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be merged by Google with other
    data. You can prevent storage of cookies by means of a setting in your browser software; however, we must advise you
    that in this case you might not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent.
    Beyond this, you can also prevent collection of the data that is generated by cookies and related to your use of

    installing the browser plugin available under the following link. <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
    We like to point out, however, that in this case you might not be able to use all the website’s functions to their
    full extent. By using our website, you agree to the processing of the compiled data by Google in the aforementioned
    manner and for the aforementioned purpose.

            the
            cookies that are placed through our banners by third parties. This is particularly the case when our banners

            that are shown on, in or through our banners.

            please let us know or contact the third party directly and ask which cookies they have placed, what the

            for this is, what the lifetime of the cookie is and in what way they have safeguarded your privacy.

            YOUR RIGHTS WITH REGARDS TO YOUR DATA

    <li>Use of Google AdSense / Doubleclick</li>

    tellows uses Google Adsense, an advertisement service of Google Inc., Mountain View, USA („Google“). Google Adsense
    uses „Cookies“ which are stored by your browser (e.g. as small text files) on your computer and which allow an
    analysis of your usage of this website. Google Adsense also uses so-called „Web Beacons“ (little invisible images)
    to collect information. By using Web Beacons simple actions like visitor traffic on the website may be recorded and
    collected. The information about your usage of the website generated by the cookies and/or Web Beacons (including
    your IP address) will be transmitted to a server of Google in the United States of America and will be stored there.
    You can prevent the storage of cookies in your browser.

    In the event that personal data is transferred to the USA, corresponding EU standard contracts (adequate guarantee
    for data processing in non-European countries) have been concluded with Google LLC. The EU standard contractual
    clauses used can be accessed via the URL <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087</a>.

    Information collected by Google may be shared with third parties, by contract or by law, by Google. Google will not
    connect your IP address with other data you have stored.
    With the corresponding settings on your web browser you can prevent the mentioned cookies from being stored on your
    PC. However, there is the possibility that the contents of this website can no longer be used to the same extent. By
    using this site, you consent to the processing of personal data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out
    above.

    <li>Use of the Facebook-Plugin</li>

    On these websites, the plugins of the social network facebook.com are utilized, which are run by Facebook Inc., 1601
    S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA („Facebook“). If you open a website of our web presence with such a
    plugin, a connection to the Facebook servers is established and the plugin is shown through a message to your
    browser. Hereby, the Facebook server is signalled about which websites of ours you have visited. If you are logged
    in as a member of Facebook at that time, Facebook will assign this information to your Facebook user account. By
    using the plugin functions (e.g. click on the „like“-buttons, writing of comments), this information is also
    attributed to your Facebook user account, which you can only prevent by logging out before using the plugins.
    If you are not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save your IP
    address. According to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored. Further information on the gathering and
    usage of data by Facebook and your respective rights and possibilities to protect your privacy can be found in the
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">privacy section on Facebook</a>.

    <li>Conversion Tracking Pixel of Facebook and Facebook Custom Audience</li>

    With your permission, tellows uses the “conversion tracking pixel” of the Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave,
    Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook). With this tool we can follow actions of the users after they saw or clicked a
    Facebook advertisement. Therefore we can record the efficiency of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market
    research purposes. The collected data is anonymous, which means we cannot see the personal data of the user. To our
    knowledge and your information, Facebook will store and process these data.

    Facebook is able to connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertisement purposes
    according to its own privacy policy you find under <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
    You are able to give permission to Facebook and its partners for the use of advertisement in and outside of
    Facebook. Storing of a cookie on your computer for these purposes is possible. Only users over 13 years of age can
    declare such permission. If you are younger please ask your legal guardian.

    Facebook users should note that tellows uses the Website Custom Audience communication tool from Facebook. For this
    purpose, so-called Facebook pixels are built into our websites. If you are a Facebook user, Facebook is thus able to
    assign your visit of our website pages to your Facebook user account. Further, Facebook can subsequently find out
    whether a particular Facebook ad was effective. The Facebook pixel also enables us to distribute ads to defined
    recipients via Facebook. For this purpose, we exclusively receive statistical data from Facebook that is not related
    to actual persons. The purpose of this measure is to optimize our website in terms of advertising appeal, market
    research, and demand-driven design. The pixel-based tracking activities are performed in a way that does not enable
    us to identify you personally and only marks users as visitors of our website in anonymized form for us.

    For more information on the purpose and extent of data collection and further processing and use of the data by
    Facebook as well as the options you have to protect your privacy, please refer to the Facebook data privacy policy
    that can be found at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation</a>.
    Right of revocation: Objections against the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences can be made at <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences">https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences</a>.
    For this, you must be logged in to Facebook.

    <li>Google Fonts</li>

    We are incorporating the fonts ("Google Fonts") provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA
    94043, USA, to optimize web page loading rates. The integration of these web fonts is done by a server call, usually
    a Google server in the USA. The websites you have visited will be transferred to the server. Also, the IP address of
    the browser which has been used by the visitor of this website is stored by Google. The privacy policy can be found
    at: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> and the opt-out
    at: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>.

    <li>Google Library for Ajax and jQuery</li>

    We use Ajax and jQuery's JavaScript library to optimize the webpage's loading rate. In this case, program libraries
    are retrieved from servers of the company Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
    (Google) specifically the Google CDN. If you have already used jQuery on another page of the Google CDN, your
    browser will use the cached copy. Otherwise, the required information will be downloaded. In doing so, your visited
    website will be sent to the Google server. Also, the IP address of your device is stored by Google. For more
    information, please visit: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cdn/?hl=en">https://cloud.google.com/cdn/?hl=en</a> and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/?hl=en">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/?hl=en</a>. To
    prevent the execution of JavaScript, you can install a JavaScript Blocker.

    <li>Google reCAPTCHA</li>

    We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600
    Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered
    on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this,
    reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts
    automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various
    information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user).
    The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.

    The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an
    analysis is taking place.
    Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its
    site from abusive automated crawling and spam.

    <li>Google Maps</li>

    We use the Google Maps service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, to
    illustrate the location of addresses. The privacy policy can be found at: <a
        href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> and the opt-out at:
    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>.

    Information about your use of our website (such as your IP address) is transferred to Google servers in the USA and
    stored there when you call up those sub-pages in which the Google Maps map is integrated. This occurs regardless of
    whether Google provides a user account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are
    logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your account. If you do not want your data to be
    associated with your Google profile, you must log out of your Google user account. Google stores your data (even for
    users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. You have the right to object to the creation of
    these user profiles, and you must contact Google to exercise this right.

    Google Ireland Limited ensures compliance with the level of data protection applicable in the EU by accepting and
    agreeing to the so-called EU standard contractual clauses on data protection.

    If you do not agree to the future transmission of your data to Google in the context of the use of Google Maps, you
    also have the option of completely deactivating the Google Maps web service by switching off the JavaScript
    application in your browser. Google Maps and thus also the map display on this website can then not be used.
    These processing operations are only carried out when explicit consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1
    lit. a GDPR.

    <li>OpenStreetMap</li>

    This site uses the open source mapping tool "OpenStreetMap" (OSM) via an API. The provider is the OpenStreetMap
    Foundation. To use the functions of OpenStreetMap, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information is
    usually transmitted to a server of OpenStreetMap and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on
    this data transmission.

    The use of OpenStreetMap is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers and an easy location
    of the places indicated by us on the website. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6
    Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

    By using our website, you consent to the processing of data by OpenStreetMap. The execution of data processing by
    OpenStreetMap can be prevented by deactivating the Javascript in your browser. However, this will prevent the
    OpenStreetMap map view from being displayed.

    More information on the handling of user data can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">privacy

    <li>ShareThis Social Media Buttons on the tellows Blog</li>

    On our blog we use the service of ShareThis to provide social media sharing tools. ShareThis collects information
    via technical cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, HTTP headers (or other communication protocols), and
    browser identifiers. No flash cookies or other locally stored objects (LSO) are used to circumvent user opt-out
    choices. ShareThis collects registration information and Usage Data. Usage Data collects and uses technical data

    on social sharing.

    ShareThis does not at any point collect contact information such as your name, address, phone number, address,
    credit card information, or anything else that can allow us or our clients to contact you directly. ShareThis shares
    Usage Data, including audience segments, with advertisers, Publishers, and other data partners (all, “Our

    <li>SSL Encryption</li>

    tellows uses SSL encryption for security and to protect the transmission of sensitive content, such as the requests
    you send to the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by changing the address line of the browser
    from "http://" to "https://" and the lock symbol in your browser bar.

    If SSL encryption is enabled, the data you submit to us cannot be read by third parties.

    <li>OpenID Login</li>

    No registration is required to participate in the tellows forum. Comments can be submitted as a registered or
    unregistered user. An OpenID service can be used to register. Thereby, an existing account of another service (e.g.
    Google) is linked to the tellows website through an authentication system. No separate account is created on the
    tellows website. Linking an account through OpenID enables additional options for comments and account settings on
    tellows. OpenID users are registered with the e-mail address of the linked account. The e-mail address must always
    be accessible to the user in order to be contacted for possible queries on the part of tellows. The use of an
    invalid e-mail address is not permitted.

    The data entered during registration will be used for the purpose of using the website. Users may be informed by
    email about website- or registration-related information, such as changes in the scope of the offer or technical
    circumstances. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user's protection against misuse and
    other unauthorized use.

    <li>tellows in Social Networks</li>

    To also communicate with you on social networks and inform you about our services, we are represented there with our
    own pages. If you visit one of our social media pages, we are jointly responsible with the provider of the
    respective social media platform within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR with regard to the processing operations
    triggered thereby which concern personal data.

    We are not the original provider of these pages, but merely use them within the scope of the possibilities offered
    to us by the respective providers.
    As a precaution, we therefore point out that your data may also be processed outside the European Union or the
    European Economic Area. Use may therefore entail data protection risks for you, as it may be more difficult to
    protect your rights, e.g. to information, deletion, objection, etc., and the processing in the social networks often
    takes place directly for advertising purposes or for the analysis of user behaviour by the providers, without this
    being able to be influenced by us. If usage profiles are created by the provider, cookies are often used or the
    usage behaviour is directly assigned to your own member profile of the social networks (if you are logged in here).
    The described processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis
    of our legitimate interest and the legitimate interest of the respective provider in order to be able to communicate
    with you in a timely manner or to inform you about our services. If you have to give your consent to data processing
    as a user with the respective providers, the legal basis refers to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR in conjunction with Art. 7
    GDPR.

    As we do not have access to the providers' databases, we would like to point out that it is best to exercise your
    rights (e.g. to information, correction, deletion, etc.) directly with the respective provider. Further information
    on the processing of your data in the social networks and the possibility to make use of your right of objection or
    revocation (so-called opt-out) is listed below at the respective provider of social networks used by us:

    someone publishes illegal content (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.). In this case, tellows could be
    prosecuted for the content. Therefore, we are interested in the identity of the comment author.

    It is possible to subscribe to the number pages. To do so, you must enter your e-mail address. You will receive a
    confirmation email to verify that you are the owner of the entered email address. You can unsubscribe from the
    notifications at any time. The confirmation email contains instructions.

    <li>Right of removal of comments on a telephone number</li>

    On tellows, every user can leave comments regarding any telephone number. These comments represent the opinion of
    the comment’s author and <strong>not the opinion of tellows on that phone number</strong>. Which is why we created
    an option to delete comments. Under every comment, there is a button called „Report the comment as spam“. With a
    simple click on this button, comments are directly deleted. Comments from registered users who have a tellows
    account cannot be removed by other users. In this case it is necessary to inform us by email to kontaktATtellows.de
    about the removal request. Registered tellows users have the opportunity to comment on the deletion request within
    48 hours. If no credible statement is made, the comment will be removed. More information about comment removals for
    registered users can be found <a href="https://tellows.de/c/about-tellows-uk/terms-of-use/#termsofuseforum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

    <li>Right of Information</li>

    You have the right to obtain the information about your person any time. If you have further questions regarding the
    privacy policy or need more information on a certain point, you can contact our data protection officer at
    datenschutzATtellows.de (replace AT with a @).

    <li>Right to Erasure</li>

    The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or
    her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
    where one of the following grounds applies:
    <ul>
        <li>the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or
            otherwise processed;
        </li>
        <li>the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point a of Art. 6 s. 1, or
            point a of Art. 9 s. 2, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
        </li>
        <li>the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 s. 1 and there are no overriding legitimate
            grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 s. 2;
        </li>
        <li>the personal data has been unlawfully processed;</li>
        <li>the personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to
            which the controller is subject;
        </li>
        <li>the personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of information services referred to in Art. 8
            s. 1.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged to erase the personal data, the controller,
    taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including
    technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested
    the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy, or replication of, those personal data.

    This right shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for erasure (“right to be forgotten”). This
    includes the following requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
        <li>compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the
            controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
            of official authority vested in the controller;
        </li>
        <li>the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Right to Restriction of Processing</li>

    The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the
    following applies:
    <ul>
        <li>the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to
            verify the accuracy of the personal data;
        </li>
        <li>the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the
            restriction of their use instead;
        </li>
        <li>the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required
            by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
        </li>
        <li>the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 s. 1 pending the verification whether the
            legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Where processing has been restricted under s. 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be
    processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the
    protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union
    or of a Member State.

    In order to allege the right to restriction of processing, the data subject can contact us at any time under
    datenschutzATtellows.de (replace AT with @).

    <li>Right to Data Portability</li>

    The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has
    provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and has the right to transmit
    this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided,
    where:
    <ul>
        <li>the processing is based on consent pursuant to point a of Art. 6 s. 1 or point a of Art. 9 s. 2 or on a
            contract pursuant to point b of Article 6 s.1 GDPR; and
        </li>
        <li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
    </ul>
    In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to s. 1, the data subject shall have the right to have
    the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. The exercise of
    the right of removal shall be unaffected. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of
    a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

    <li>Right to Object</li>

    The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time
    to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point e or f of Art. 6 s. 1, including
    profiling based on those provisions.

    The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate
    grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the
    establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

    Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at
    any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the
    extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

    In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data
    subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.

    Please contact datenschutzATtellows.de for an objection (replace AT with @).

    <li>Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling</li>

    The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing,
    including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or
    her. This shall not apply if the decision:
    <ul>
        <li>is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data
            controller;
        </li>
        <li>is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down
            suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or
        </li>
        <li>is based on the data subject’s explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>
    In these cases, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and
    freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to
    express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.

    This right can be exercised by the affected person at any time by addressing himself to the responsible person.

    <li>Right to Complain to a Regulating Authority</li>

    Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to complain to a regulating
    authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if
    the person in subject considers that the processing of the personal data infringes this Regulation.

    <li>Right to Effective Legal Remedy</li>

    Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-legal remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with
    a supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 77, each data subject shall have the right to an effective legal remedy
    where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the
    processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation.

    <li>Questions about Privacy</li>

    If further questions or suggestions regarding the subject of privacy might arise, please contact our data privacy
    officer Christian Anton at datenschutzATtellows.de (replace the AT with @).

<ul class="terms" style="list-style-type: none;padding-left: 0;">
    At tellows, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. We
    comply with the data protection regulations of the European Union regarding your personal data. This disclaimer
    refers only to our tellows applications. Third parties might offer hyperlinks to other websites which may have
    information policies and practices different from ours. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy
    policies, practices, or the content of any third party Web sites. Once you've left our websites via such a link or
    by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser
    site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.

    tellows uses the submitted comments and ratings from the tellows website and applications to evaluate telephone
    numbers in applications. No personal data of the comment’s author is used or stored in this process. Only the
    submitted comments and the resulting ratings are used to categorize the telephone numbers. Applications, based on
    this information are run by tellows and by third parties working in a contractual relationship.

    <li>tellows iOS Applications</li>
    To ensure the full extent of the premium iOS-applications “tellows pro Caller ID” and “tellows - Reverse Search”
    features, during installation, the creation of three new contacts in your smartphone is necessary. In these
    contacts, the score lists are saved, giving its user information about the type and rating of an undesired caller.
    During installation, the approval to access the smartphone’s contacts is a requirement. Personal contacts and data
    is not accessed. The iPhone app "tellows Caller ID & Block" imports the score lists into the internal storage of the
    iPhone.
    The detailed terms of use for the iPhone apps can be found here:
    <a href="https://www.tellows.co.uk/c/about-tellows-uk/terms-of-use/#termsofuseapp">https://www.tellows.co.uk/c/about-tellows-uk/terms-of-use/#termsofuseapp</a><br />
    <li>Push notification</li>
    In order to ensure the latest status of the score list, the sending of push notifications is essential. The basis
    for data processing in connection with the sending of push notifications is your consent. You can revoke your
    consent at any time with effect for the future. To do so, it is best to simply deactivate push notifications on your
    end device.
    You can deactivate the push notifications on your mobile device at any time under "Messages" in the "tellows Caller
    ID & Blocker" tab.

    <li>tellows Android app</li>
    At tellows, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. To
    better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining of our online information practices, including how we
    collect and use the information you may provide to us on the website, and the choices you can make about the way
    your information is collected and used. We comply with the data protection regulations of the European Union
    regarding your personal data. This disclaimer refers only to our sites and app "tellows - Caller ID & Block". Third
    parties might offer hyperlinks to other websites which may have information policies and practices different from
    ours. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices, or the content of any third
    party Web sites. Once you\'ve left our websites via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check
    the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any
    information they collect from you.

    <li>Use of data in the tellows Application</li>
    The tellows Android app registers incoming calls and sends the phone number to tellows to compare it with the
    blacklist and block it if necessary. With the submission of comments and the resulting ratings, phone numbers are
    classified. When a rating is submitted, the rated telephone number and the associated data such as comment and user
    name are sent to tellows. When a rating is submitted, the IP address is also transmitted to tellows. The removal of
    content can be done with the help of a spam button. Telephone numbers of incoming calls are sent to our server to
    provide anonymised caller statistics and activities on spam telephone numbers. Numbers from your own contacts are
    not transferred to tellows if contact sharing permission has been granted. When using the premium version, a
    personal block list is imported into the phone, which is used to identify and block the numbers on the block list.
    The phone number is added by the application. Personal contacts and data remain unaffected.

    <li>Permissions of the tellows Android app</li>
    To ensure the full functionality of the tellows app, the following permissions must be granted prior to use:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Call logs</b><br>
            Comparison of telephone numbers with the tellows database and assignment of a scoring, if the telephone
            number
            of the incoming call does not exist in your existing contacts.
        </li>
        <li><b>Make and manage phone calls</b><br>
            View caller information or block the phone number during an incoming call. Therefore unknown phone numbers
            from
            incoming calls are sent to our servers.
        </li>
        <li><b>Contacts</b><br>
            Granting the permission to share contacts ensures that only unknown phone numbers are checked by tellows and
            no
            contacts that you already know. With the permission contacts are excluded from identification and do not
            receive
            a tellows scoring. Personal contacts will not be sent to tellows.
        </li>
        <li><b>Receive SMS (optional)</b><br>
            View information about unknown phone number after receiving SMS. If enabled unknown phone numbers from the
            SMS
            Log are send to the tellows server for identification.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Personal data</li>
    Personal data is individual information about personal and factual circumstances of an identified or identifiable
    natural person. In other words, information that identifies a person or at least makes him or her identifiable. All
    this data is subject to special protection in accordance with data protection regulations, which we ensure on
    tellows and the associated applications through technical and organisational measures. This data is only used for
    the purpose of statistical evaluations and to optimise the website, as well as to prevent misuse.

    The following data is collected when you use the tellows app or mobile website:
    <ul>
        <li>Referrer URL (entry page reached via tellows)</li>

        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Internet pages viewed during the visit to tellows</li>
        <li>IP address (host name of the accessing computer)</li>

    <li>Use of Google Admob in the Android Application</li>
    For advertising, we use the advertising partner AdMob Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA
    94043, USA). Admob stores user data in order to display ads that are relevant to you. These ads appear only in the
    free app version. Google Admob uses cookies that are stored on your computer and that allow you to analyze the use
    of the app by you. In addition, Google Admob also uses so-called "web beacons" (small invisible graphics) to collect
    and evaluate simple actions such as visitor traffic on the website. The information about the usage of this app
    generated by the cookie and / or web beacon (including your IP address) is usually transmitted to and stored by
    Google on servers in the United States. Google uses the obtained information to evaluate your usage behavior with
    respect to the Google Admob ads. The IP address submitted by your browser will not be merged with other Google data.
    The information collected by Google may be transferred to third parties, if required by law and / or as far as third
    parties process this data on behalf of Google. You may permanently opt-out of setting a cookie by changing the
    settings on your browser software or by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following

    The data generated in this context can be transmitted by Google to a server in the USA for evaluation and stored
    there. In the event that personal data is transferred to the USA, corresponding EU standard contracts (appropriate
    guarantee for data processing in non-European countries) have been concluded with Google LLC. You can find the EU

    <li>Use of Google Firebase in the Android and iOS Applications</li>
    Our app uses Google Firebase technology (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA,
    "Google"). Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers many services to developers. Some Firebase
    services process personal information. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called "instance IDs" that
    are time-stamped. Firebase\'s Instance IDs are unique, allowing you to link different events or processes. These
    data are neither personally identifiable information nor do we make efforts to personalize it afterwards. We process
    this summarized data for the analysis and optimization of the usage behavior, as for example by the evaluation of
    crash reports. We do not use Firebase services that use personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses,
    e-mail addresses, telephone numbers or passwords.

    The data generated in this context can be transmitted by Google to a server in the USA for evaluation and stored

    <li>Use of Crashlytics in the Android and iOS Applications</li>
    Our app uses the analytical tools from Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. It uses information
    about the device, the version of the app you have installed, and other information that can help troubleshoot
    errors. These relate primarily to the software and hardware of the user. No personal data will be transmitted. Only
    real-time crash reports will be sent, with details of codes and device information designed to simplify maintenance
    and improve the resulting stability of the app. This tool uses anonymized IP addresses for analysis purposes.
    Therefore, it cannot be determined who is the user of the IP address concerned.

    <li>Use of Facebook SDK in the Android and iOS Applications</li>
    Furthermore, the app uses the so-called Facebook Software Development Kit (SDK). The Facebook SDK is published and
    administered by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook") (legal basis is Art. 6
    (1) lit. GDPR) The use of the Facebook SDK enables us to optimize the advertising success on Facebook via the app
    by, for example, not displaying ads on those devices on which the app is already installed. For this purpose, the
    app transmits the following pseudonymized data to Facebook: The App ID (identical on all devices), the information
    that the app has been started and provided by the operating system of the device Advertising Identifier (IDFA).
    Further data will not be transmitted to Facebook. We also do not receive any data back from Facebook that could
    allow us to identify users.

    By using the app, the user declares their consent to the integration of the Facebook SDK and the associated
    collection, storage, transfer and processing of user data to the extent described. The information collected in this
    way is not linked to personal information from tellows users in the analysis software. In this context, user data
    can also be transmitted to servers in the USA.

    <li>Right of Information</li>
    You have the right to obtain the information about your person any time. If you have further questions regarding the
    privacy policy or need more information on a certain point, you can contact our data protection officer at
    <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#23474257464d50404b5657596357464f4f4c54500d4746"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="482c293c2d263b2b203d3c32083c2d2424273f3b662c2d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

    <li>Right of removal of comments on a telephone number</li>
    On tellows, every user can leave comments regarding any telephone number. These comments represent the opinion of
    the comment's author and not the opinion of tellows on that phone number. Which is why we created an option to
    delete comments. Under every comment in the mobile version of the website (not in the app), there is a button called
    "Report the comment as spam". With a simple click on this button, comments are directly deleted.

    <li>Questions about Privacy</li>
    If further questions or suggestions regarding the subject of privacy might arise, please contact our data privacy
    officer Christian Anton at
