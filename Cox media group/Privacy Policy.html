Data Technologies include all current and similar future technologies. </p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Cookies </b>- A cookie is a small file placed on your device for the purposes of identifying your browser or storing information or settings in your browser.  You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain features of the CMG Network Sites.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to access the CMG Network Sites.

For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see the Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information section below. </p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Web Beacons</b> - A web beacon, also known as a single pixel GIF, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies, and allows us to obtain information on the number of users who visit those pages and other traffic-related statistics. </p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Personal Information Obtained Through Third Parties </p></u>\n<p>We may partner with third-party service providers, such as ad networks, to serve advertising to you based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices, and mobile applications (“online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising). </p>\n<br>\n<p>Third-party service providers may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates, and other advertisers.  This data collection takes place both on the CMG Network Sites and on third-party websites and mobile applications. </p>\n<br>\n<p>These third parties may use their Data Technologies to collect information about you when you use the CMG Network Sites.  The information they collect may be associated with your personal information, or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.  They may use this information to provide you interest-based advertising or other targeted content.  We do not control these third parties tracking technologies or how they may be used. </p>\n<br>\n<p>Some companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising programs on the CMG Network Sites to deliver third-party ads or collecting information about your visit for these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information.

Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information  </p></b>\n<p>We strive to provide you with choices about how we communicate with you.  Mechanisms below will provide you with controls over your information. </p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Registration and SMS Alerts </p></u>\n<p>You may choose not to provide personal information, even though that might impact your ability to register or receive a particular product or service.  If you register with us, you also have the option of deleting all information except for your email address.  If you would like to completely deactivate your account, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@cmg.com\">privacy@cmg.com</a>.  Please note, however, that if you deactivate your account, you will not receive any newsletters from us, and you will not be able to participate in any of our contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions.  Also, even if you deactivate your account, you still need to go through a separate process to unsubscribe from SMS alerts you previously signed up to receive.  You can unsubscribe from these alerts by using the “STOP” function within those messages.  You agree that, subject to applicable law, we may use your information to contact you for customer service, to inform you of important changes to our products or services, and to send you administrative notices or any communications relevant to your use of the CMG Network Sites, including communications in the event of a data security event. </p>\n<br>\n<p> <u>Newsletters and Other Email Communications </p></u>\n<p>If you decide to unsubscribe from our email newsletters to which you had previously subscribed, or if you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, you can follow the unsubscribe link provided in those emails. </p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Data Technologies </p></u>\n<p>You have a number of choices regarding certain Data Technologies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons by changing the add-ons settings or opting out at the website of the technology provider.  For example, to manage your Flash cookie settings, you may visit the Flash player settings page on the Adobe website and follow their instructions. </p>\n<br>\n<p>If you disable certain Data Technologies or opt out from location services, however, certain features of the CMG Network Sites may not function properly or at all as a result. </p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Internet-based Advertisements </p></u>\nYou can opt out of delivery of targeted advertising to you by multiple companies by visiting <a href=“https://www.aboutads.info/choices”>https://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href=“https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp”>https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.  Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.  To learn more about your choices when it comes to the use of online behavioral advertising data by advertisers and ad servers across the Internet, visit <a href=“https://youradchoices.com/”>https://youradchoices.com/</a>. </p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Do Not Track</u></p>\n<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit.  We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit <a href=“http://www.allaboutdnt.com”>http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Linked Third-Party Platforms</p></u>\n<p>If you choose to connect to the CMG Network Sites through your social media account or other third-party platform, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it.  If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.</p>\n<br>\n<p><u>Declining to Provide Information</u></p>\n<p>We need to collect personal information to provide certain services.  If you do not provide the information we identify as required or mandatory, we may not be able to provide those services.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>6. Access and Corrections </b></p>\n<p>Access to information that we collect and maintain about you may be available to you.  For example, if you registered for a password-protected account within the CMG Network Sites, you can access that account to update the information you previously provided. </p>\n<br>\n<p>If you delete your user contributions from the CMG Network Sites, copies of your user contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other users.  Proper access and use of information provided on the CMG Network Sites, including user contributions, is governed by our Visitor Agreement. </p>\n<br>\n<p><b>7. Links and Other Third-Party Services </p></b>\n<p>The CMG Network Sites may contain links to websites and other resources not operated by us.  We are not responsible for the content or use of any websites or resources other than those on the CMG Network Sites.  Providers of these websites and other resources may have their own privacy policies or notices, which we strongly suggest you review. </p>\n<br>\n<p><b>8. How We Protect Personal Information </p></b>\n<p>We use administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures designed to safeguard information about you in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of networks, servers and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf. </p>\n<br>\n<p><b>9. Safeguarding Your Account </p></b>\nThe safety and security of your information also depends on you.
