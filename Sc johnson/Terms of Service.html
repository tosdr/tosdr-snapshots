Any Computer Download may only be used on your own computer (or a computer controlled by you), and any Mobile Download may only be used on your own mobile device (or a device controlled by you).</p>
<p>All Submissions will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. SC Johnson will have no obligations with respect to Submissions. We cannot guarantee that other users (or other third parties) will not use the ideas that you share. Therefore, if you have an idea that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it to the Website. Also, any Submission you provide to us should reflect your honest opinions, findings, beliefs or experience, and are within your personal knowledge, and should not misrepresent in any respect your relationship with SC Johnson. For example, the user should disclose any material connection, if one exists, between him or her and SC Johnson in any Submission that contains an endorsement.</p>
<p>SC Johnson does not and cannot review all Submissions provided by users and is not responsible for the content of these Submissions, nor does SC Johnson endorse any Submissions. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of Submissions, and we cannot assure you that harmful, inaccurate, deceptive, offensive, threatening, defamatory, unlawful or otherwise objectionable Submissions will not appear on the Website. You should never assume any Submissions reflect the opinions or policies of SC Johnson. That is the case even though Submissions may include comments about other users’ Submissions, or comments about some of our products, services, promotions, Website or other similar information.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for (a) any Submission you post on or through the Website, (b) any material or information that you provide to us or other users (or others that view the Website), and (c) your interaction with other users (or others that view the Website). By sending a Submission to the Website, you release SC Johnson of any duty or obligation it might otherwise have to review or act in response to the Submissions, and of any duty or obligation that it might otherwise have to you in connection with any action it chooses to take in response to your Submissions.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that by providing you with the ability to submit, view or distribute these Submissions, we are acting merely as a passive conduit and are not undertaking any obligation or liability relating to Submission contents, or activities of users on the Website. However, we do reserve the right to alter, edit, refuse to post, review, reject, block, remove or take any other action that we may deem necessary to deal with any Submissions. This may include those Submissions which we find to be abusive, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, in violation of a third party’s right, including, but not limited, to intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy, or otherwise offensive or deemed unacceptable by us in our sole discretion. Such action may include, but is not limited to, removing content that allegedly does not conform to these Terms, terminating a user’s access to the Website and removing all Submissions submitted by any persons who we determine to be infringers or repeat infringers.</p>
<p>If we are notified by any user that a Submission allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion the appropriate action to take. We have no liability whatsoever for editing, removing, or continuing to permit the display of any Submissions.</p>
<p>We may obtain many Submissions on the Website that contain, or otherwise develop on our own, or through third party vendors we engage, ideas, inventions, materials and other content that may be similar or identical in theme, idea, format or other respects to Submissions you make to the Website. For example, SC Johnson is actively engaged in research and development for new products and services, and the creation of marketing and advertising materials and other content related to our products and services or that may otherwise be of interest to other users, on our own and through third party vendors. By providing a Submission, you understand that you waive any and all claims you may have had, may have, and/or may have in the future based on any ideas, invention, composition, video and/or other works used by SC Johnson (or its designees) being based upon, or otherwise being the same as or similar to, any Submissions made by you on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU SUBMIT MATERIAL TO US:</strong></p>
<p>(1) You hereby provide us with a nonexclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up and royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and unlimited license to use, edit, distribute, perform, display, incorporate, sublicense, and create derivative works of all or any portion of your Submission in any way that we see fit and for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>This means, among others, that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We don’t have to treat any such Submission as confidential.</li>
    <li>If we use such Submission or let others use such Submission -- or anything like such Submission -- we don’t have to pay you or anyone else for such Submission or use.</li>
    <li>We can use such Submission for any purpose, without compensating or notifying you or anyone else for such Submission or use.</li>
    <li>We can use such Submission in a website, digital, print or any other media throughout the world forever.</li>

<p>(2) To the extent any right you may have in or relating to any Submission cannot be licensed to SC Johnson under applicable law or legal theory, you hereby irrevocably release and waive any and all such rights, including, but not limited to, any rights of publicity, rights of privacy, trade secret rights, and “moral rights” or any other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials, or any other intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>(3) You acknowledge that you are responsible for any Submission you make -- in other words, you acknowledge that you (and not we) have full responsibility for the Submission, including its legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality, and compliance with corresponding laws.</p>
<p>(4) You also acknowledge that we do not have any obligation to use, post, or respond to any Submission. We may contact you or any third parties to verify the information contained in a Submission you provide to us, obtain additional commentary, and to film, record and make a record of any statements made by you or others in the course of our conversations or correspondence with you. You agree that any materials created from such activities will be owned by us and may be used in any manner we deem appropriate. We may also send you information and notices regarding your Submission through the Website, by email or other means based on the information you provided to us in connection with your Submission.</p>
<p>SC Johnson reserves the right at any time and from time to time to discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the acceptance of some or all Submissions and/or your ability to access Submissions with or without notice in its sole discretion.

                <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Website; (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright right that has been allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with the above requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice with our copyright agent. You should note that there may be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
<p>Our copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows:</p>

<p>EMAIL: <a href="mailto:DMCAnotice@scj.com">DMCAnotice@scj.com</a></p>
<p>This contact information is only for suspected copyright infringement. Upon receipt of such a notice of claimed infringement (or any statement in conformance with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)), SC Johnson will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any content that is claimed to be infringing upon the copyright of any person under the laws of the United States, and will terminate the Website privileges of those who repeatedly infringe on the copyright of others.

<p>We cannot guarantee that product listed as available will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day to day. In rare cases, a product may be in stock when you place your order, and sold out by the time your order is processed.</p>
<p>Where applicable, our policies relating to shipping and return/replacement of products are posted on the Website for your review. Review those policies prior to purchasing products from the Website.</p>
<p>Prices and availability of products listed on the Website are subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>While we strive to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error, or any other reason, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order placed for such product at the incorrect price, even if the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card has been charged. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we shall promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.</p>
<p>There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by or using the same online account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. We will provide notification to the customer should such limits be applied.</p>
