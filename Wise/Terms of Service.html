<p><strong>Using Our Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Opening a Wise Account</strong></p>
<p>In order to use some or all of the Services, you must first open a Wise Account by providing certain information.  For legal reasons, all information you provide during the signup process or any time thereafter must be complete, accurate and truthful. You are responsible for keeping your mailing address, email address, telephone number, and other contact information up-to-date in your Wise Account profile.  To make changes to your profile, <a href="/login/">login here</a> and then go to your <a href="/user/account">account page</a>.  We may refuse to provide or may discontinue providing the Services to any person or entity at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>We treat all activities under a Wise Account to be those of the registered user. You must only use the Services to transact on your own account and not on behalf of any other person or entity.  You may only open one Wise Account unless we explicitly approve the opening of additional accounts. We may refuse the creation of duplicate accounts for the same user. Where duplicate accounts are detected, Wise may close or merge these duplicate accounts without notification to you.</p>
<p><a name="account-security"></a><strong>Account Security</strong></p>
<p>You, not Wise, are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, or any other details that you use to access your Wise Account and the Services.  You must never disclose your Wise Account password or your customer reference number (see our <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> for more information about these credentials).  Keep them safe. Change your password regularly. We will never ask you to provide your password to us or to a third party. Tell us if anyone asks for your password, and contact <a href="/contact">Customer Support</a> if you are not sure about this, or any other security-related aspect of your Wise Account. Review third-party recommendations on the creation and use of passwords, for example: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040?hl%3Den">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040?hl=en</a>. You must never let anyone access your Wise Account or watch you accessing your Wise Account.</p>
<p>If you suspect your Wise Account, login details, password or any other security features are stolen, lost, used without authorization or otherwise compromised, you are advised to change your password. Contact <a href="/contact">Customer Support</a> immediately if you believe your credentials have been compromised or you are suspicious about the security of your password or any other security features. The compromise of your credentials could enable thieves to access your bank account and attempt transactions not authorized by you. Telephoning us is the best way to minimize your risk of loss.  In addition, contact us at once if your transaction history for your Wise Account shows transactions that you did not initiate. We rely on you to regularly check the transactions history of your Wise Account and to contact <a href="/contact">Customer Support</a> immediately in case you have any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>We may (but are not obligated to) suspend your Wise Account or otherwise restrict its functionality if we have concerns about the security of the Wise Account or any of its security features; or potential unauthorized or fraudulent use of your Wise Account or any of its security features. See <a href="#transferwise-can-close-your-transferwise-account">Wise can close your Wise Account</a>, below for more details.</p>
<p>You must make sure that your e-mail account(s) are secure and only accessible by you, as your e-mail address may be used to reset passwords or to communicate with you about the security of your Wise Account. Let <a href="/contact">Customer Support</a> know immediately if your email address becomes compromised.  Never use any functionality that allows login details or passwords to be stored by the computer or browser you are using or to be cached or otherwise recorded.  Additional Wise products or Services you use may have additional security requirements, as notified to you by us, and you must familiarize yourself with those requirements.</p>
<p>In the case of what you believe to be any incorrect or misdirected payment, please see <a href="#protection-from-unauthorized-transactions">Protection from Unauthorized Transactions</a>, <a href="#cancellation-of-your-currency-conversion-order">Cancellation of your currency conversion order</a>, and <a href="#error-resolution">Error Resolution</a> below.</p>
<strong>Authorizing Third Parties</strong>
<p>You may authorize third parties to access your Wise Account to provide their services to you, including authorizing them to initiate payments from your Wise Account. You acknowledge that if you authorize a third party to access your Wise Account, we may disclose certain information about your Wise Account to this third party. We are not responsible for any such third party’s use of your Wise Account or any information in your Wise Account. Granting permission to a third party does not relieve you of your responsibilities under this Customer Agreement, including notifying us if your Wise Account has been compromised or if a transaction is incorrect or unauthorized.</p>
<strong>Verification</strong>
<p>If you open a Wise Account and use certain Services, federal law requires that we verify some of your information. You authorize Wise to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity. These may be made directly or through third parties, including checking commercial databases or credit reports. We may need to ask you for further information, requiring you to provide your date of birth, a taxpayer identification number and other information that will allow us to reasonably identify you. This could include requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report from a credit reporting agency, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources.  We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents at any time. Wise reserves the right to close, suspend, or limit access to your Wise Account and/or the Services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify this information.</p>
<p><strong>Our Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uploading Money</strong></p>
<p>You may upload money in supported currencies into your Wise Account in order to (i) Transfer money (i.e. convert the currency and send it to your account or to another person) or (ii) add money to your Borderless Account for use later. The supported Currencies are listed on our Website.</p>
<p>For (i) above, we will automatically add the money you to send to us to your Borderless Account before we process your Transfer by sending it to your chosen beneficiary, which will typically happen immediately after we receive your funds into your Borderless Account.</p>
<p>Transfers where the Source Currency you choose is one of the following: AUD, AED, BRL, HKD, MYR, IDR, INR, JPY, MYR will be directly processed and will not involve your Borderless Account, meaning it will not be processed with the payments via accounts mechanism. See <strong>Transferring Money or Withdrawing Money from your Borderless Account</strong> for more details. For Transfers funded from balances held in your Borderless Account, if the payment is validly canceled before funds are picked up or deposited, we may return the amount to your Borderless Account. See <strong>Cancellation of a Transfer Order</strong> for more details.</p>
<p>You can upload money through one or more methods, for example, bank transfer (ACH or wire), credit cards or debit cards. The number of methods available to you will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us, as well as other factors. Upload methods are not part of our Services, they are services provided by third parties, for example, the card provider which issued your credit or debit card. We cannot guarantee the use of any particular upload method and may change or stop offering a particular upload method at any time without notice to you.</p>
<p>We will credit your Wise Account once we have received your money, and we are not responsible for the money you have uploaded until we have received it.  For some particular upload methods, we will credit the money to your Wise Account as soon as possible subject to our right of reversal.  This means if the actual amount you intended to upload does not reach us within a reasonable time, we may deduct such amount from your Wise Account. See <a href="#reversals-and-chargebacks">Reversals and Chargebacks</a>, for details.  If you do not have enough money in your Wise Account for this purpose, we can demand repayment from you using other methods. See <a href="#negative-account-balances">Negative Account Balances</a>for further details.</p>
<strong>Uploading Money by Direct Debit (ACH Pull)</strong>
<p>If you choose to upload money using our automated clearinghouse (ACH) pull direct debit feature, you will need to provide your bank login details or bank account details, including your bank account number and routing number. When you choose to upload money using our ACH pull direct debit feature and provide your details, you confirm that your details are correct, that you are authorized to access and transmit funds from your bank account, that your bank account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate an electronic funds transfer in the amount at issue to or from your bank account.</p>
<p>When you choose to upload money using our ACH pull direct debit feature and by providing your bank account details and requesting a transaction, you authorize us to initiate electronic credits and debits to your bank account through the ACH network, including any applicable fees and charges, and this authorization shall remain in effect so long as you are a  registered user with the Service unless canceled in accordance with this Customer Agreement.</p>
<strong>Uploading Money by Debit or Credit Card</strong>
<p>If you choose to upload money via debit or credit card, provided we offer such options, you will need to provide your card details, including your card number and cardholder name. When you choose to upload money via debit or credit card, you confirm that your card details are correct, that you are authorized to access and transmit funds from your card account, that your card account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate a debit or credit card payment in the amount at issue to or from your card account.  You may authorize us to initiate credits and debits to your bank account through card payment networks in order to process a requested transaction, including any applicable fees and charges, and this authorization shall remain in effect so long as you are a registered user with the Service unless canceled in accordance with this Customer Agreement.</p>
<strong>Uploading Money by Wire or ACH Push</strong>
<p>If you choose to upload money using the ACH push or domestic wire transfer method, then your transaction order will remain inactive until we receive your funds to our specified account. Such payments must be made to our specified account via ACH Push or domestic wire transfer.  In cases where for any reason the upload transaction is cancelled or refused, then we will promptly return the deposit to your bank account from which the transaction originated. In the event that we are unable to return the deposit, then we will promptly contact you using the most current contact information provided to us by you through your Wise registration.</p>
<strong>Other Information About Uploading Money</strong>
<p>No other payment methods are accepted, including cash, mailed check, or electronic check. For legal, security, or other reasons, there may be financial limits for particular payment methods or currencies, or for how much you can upload into your Borderless Account. Please visit the <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>If you selected an upload method which gives you reversal and chargeback rights (for example in relation to your credit card, you ask your card provider to reverse a transaction on your card) please see <a href="#reversals-and-chargebacks">Reversals and Chargebacks</a> below.</p>
<strong>Receiving Money into your Borderless Account</strong>
<p>The number of methods made available to you for receiving money into your Borderless Account will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us. We cannot guarantee the use of any particular upload method and may change or stop offering a particular upload method at any time without notice to you.</p>
<p>You are not permitted to receive payments by other payment methods, including cash, mailed check, or electronic check. There may be financial limits for particular payment methods or currencies, please visit the <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>When someone sends money to your Borderless Account using a method that we support, the money will appear in your Borderless Account. You should check the incoming funds in your Wise Account against your own records regularly and let us know if there are any irregularities.</p>
<p>When you receive funds you can accept them as-is and maintain a balance in your Borderless Account in that currency or accept them and then convert them to another currency. See <a href="#currency-conversion">Currency Conversion</a> below for details.</p>
<strong>Receiving Money into your Borderless Account by Wire or ACH Push</strong>
<p>In certain currencies, we may provide to you specified bank account details that you can in turn provide to third parties so that they can send money to your Borderless Account using the ACH push or domestic wire transfer method.  These account details are offered by our third-party banking partner(s).  If you choose to receive money using this method, you will not have access to such funds until we receive the funds into our specified account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the money received in your Borderless Account via this method may be subject to Reversal or Chargeback and you agree that we may deduct the received amount from your Borderless Account if it is cancelled or reversed by the person who paid you the amount or any relevant payment services provider. If for any reason the transaction is cancelled or refused, then we will promptly return the deposit to the bank account from which the transaction originated.  See further details in the Negative Account Balance section.  In the event that we are unable to return the deposit, then we will promptly contact you using the most current contact information provided to us when you registered for your Borderless Account.</p>
<p>If you provide the account details we provide to you to a third party, you agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee solely for accepting payment through a Service offered by Wise.</p>
<strong>Holding A Balance in your Borderless Account</strong>
<p>Wise is not a bank and your Borderless Account is not a bank account.  The specified bank account details that we provide to you in order for you to receive funds from third parties are for accounts held by Wise and its affiliates (and we will credit your Borderless Account, which is held by us, upon receipt of such funds), and are not for a bank account held by you. Value held as a balance in your Borderless Account represents an unsecured claim against Wise and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other deposit protection scheme. Wise invests balances held by its customers in permissible investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws. Wise owns the interest or other earnings on these investments, if any. Wise does not use balances held by its customers for operating expenses or other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make such funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. For further information on how we look after your money, please visit our <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>
<p>In addition, an active Borderless Account holder may open a “Jar.” A “Jar” is a subaccount of the Borderless Account that can be used to segregate a portion of the funds held for a designated purpose, such as a travel. You can use the funds directly from a Jar to send or transfer funds out of the Jar to external accounts or move the money back into your Wise Account balance. The funds within a Jar can be enabled for spending through Card transactions but they may not be accessed via direct debits. You should keep enough money in your Borderless account to cover all anticipated expenses. Wise is not responsible for fees resulting from unfunded transactions due to funds being captured in a jar subaccount.</p>
<p>A Jar is not a savings account, do not have their own account numbers, and don’t earn interest. Value held as a balance in your Jars represents an unsecured claim against Wise and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other deposit protection scheme.</p>
<strong>Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies</strong>
<p>Your Borderless Account balance may be held in certain currencies supported by Wise from time to time.  You may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.  You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining a Wise Account balance in multiple currencies.  You may not manage multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes.</p>
<p><a name="withdrawing-or-sending-money"></a><strong>Transferring Money or Withdrawing Money from your Borderless Account</strong></p>
<p>You may Transfer money you have uploaded, or withdraw money from your Borderless Account by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending it to your own bank account linked to your Wise Account through ACH push;</li>
<li>Sending it to another Wise customer’s account;</li>
<li>Sending it to a third party’s bank account through ACH push or wire transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for Transfers where the Source Currency you choose is any of the following: AUD, AED, BRL, HKD, MYR, IDR, INR, JPY, MYR, your Transfer will be funded from your Borderless Account balance with the payments via accounts mechanism (“payment via accounts ”). This means that these Transfers will originate from your Borderless Account. You will be able to pay into your Borderless Account using all methods currently available to you as detailed in the <strong>Uploading Money</strong> Section.</p>
<p>The number of payout methods available to you will depend on a number of factors including where you live and your verification status with us. We cannot guarantee the use of any particular payout method and may change or stop offering a payout method at any time without notice to you, but we will ensure that you will have at least one payout method available to you unless prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>
When you Transfer money, you will be charged a fee, which is referenced in the <a href="#currency-conversion">Currency Conversion</a> Section.
In addition, you will be charged a fee for each withdrawal from your Borderless Account. We will let you know the exact amount of the fee when you submit your request.
You can also find out more information about the fees we charge on the <a href="/pricing">Pricing Page</a> and below in the <a href="#fees">Fees</a> section.
You can find a list of all fees on the <a href="/us/long-form-disclosure-tw-inc">Wise Long Form Disclosure</a>
and a summary fee disclosure required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the
<a href="/us/short-form-disclosure-tw-inc">Wise Short Form Disclosure</a>.
Payout methods are not part of our Services, they are services provided by third parties for example the bank where you or the third party recipients hold a bank account.
</p>
<p>When setting Transfer order or withdrawal requests, you must ensure that the information you provide is correct and complete. We will not be responsible for money sent to the wrong recipient as a result of incorrect information provided by you. If you have provided wrong information to us, you may ask us to assist you in recovering  the money, but we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful.</p>
<p>Once we have received your Transfer order, we will send you a confirmation by email that we have received it. Please note that, with respect to funding a Transfer, a payment is made when Wise has received the funds. Each Transfer order is given a unique transfer number which is shown in the transaction history in your Wise Account on the Website. You should quote this transfer number when communicating with us about a particular Transfer.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="https://wise.com/help/articles/2932150/guide-to-usd-transfers">Guide to USD Transfers</a> for more detailed information on:</p>

<p>We may also place limits on the amount of currency you may Transfer at any given time, for more information on the applicable limits, please visit our <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.  We may limit the amount of your Transfer order consistent with our obligations under applicable law and at our discretion.  If your Transfer order is received by us after 5:00 PM EST on a Business Day or not on a Business Day, your Transfer order will be deemed received on the following Business Day.</p>
<strong>Delay in withdrawal or Transfer</strong>
<p>We do not have any control over the time it may take for your or a recipient&rsquo;s bank or payment provider to credit and make available funds to you or your recipient once we make the funds available to you or the recipient&rsquo;s bank or payment provider.</p>
<p>We may delay a withdrawal or Transfer, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that the withdrawal has been authorized by you or if other payments to your Wise Account have been reversed (for example, as a result of a chargeback or bank reversal (See <a href="#reversals-and-chargebacks">Reversals and Chargebacks</a> for more details)). The completion time of your Transfer (i.e., the date on which funds will be available to the recipient) is notified to you on your confirmation when you complete the setup of your Transfer order. You may also find further information regarding the completion time on the <a href="/us/help">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>
<strong><a name="currency-conversion"></a>Currency Conversion</strong>

<p>
A conversion fee will apply when we perform a currency conversion. &nbsp;You can also find out more information about the fees we charge on the <a href="/pricing">Pricing Page</a>
and below in the <a href="#fees">Fees</a> section. You can find a list of all fees on the <a href="/us/long-form-disclosure-tw-inc">Wise Long Form Disclosure</a>
and a summary fee disclosure required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the <a href="/us/short-form-disclosure-tw-inc">Wise Short Form Disclosure</a>.
A currency conversion order may either be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a &ldquo;Fixed Source Order&rdquo; which is a currency conversion order where you indicate that you wish to convert a fixed amount of Source Currency in order for you or your recipient to receive the converted amount in the Target Currency; or</li>
<li>a &ldquo;Fixed Target Order&rdquo; which is a currency conversion order where you indicate that you wish to convert a fixed amount of Target Currency in order to you or your recipient to receive the corrected amount in the Source Currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only place a Fixed Target Order where the Source Currencies are GBP (British Pound), EUR (Euro), USD (U.S. Dollar), AUD (Australian Dollar), BGN (Bulgarian Lev), CHF (Swiss Franc), CZK (Czech Koruna), DKK (Danish Krone), HUF (Hungarian Forint), NOK (Norwegian Krone), NZD (New Zealand Dollar), PLN (Polish Zloty), RON (New Romanian Leu) and SEK (Swedish Krona).</p>

it takes for the money to be sent to us by your bank or payment service provider.
</p>
<p>Refusing a currency conversion order. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to refuse any currency conversion order. Reasons for refusal may include but are not limited to incorrect information about the recipient, insufficient available funds, or where we believe you may have violated this Customer Agreement, including we believe you are attempting to engage in currency trading or other trading for purposes not permitted by this Customer Agreement. We will endeavour to notify you of any refusal, using the contact information in your Wise Account, stating (where possible) the reasons for such refusal and explaining how to correct any errors. However, we will not notify you if such notification may be unlawful.</p>
<p>Once we have received your currency conversion order, we will send you a confirmation by email that we have received it. &nbsp;Each currency conversion order is given a unique transaction number which&nbsp;is shown in the transaction history on your Wise Account. You should quote this transaction number when communicating with us about a particular currency conversion order.</p>
<strong>When will I be notified of my next scheduled transfers.</strong>
<p>If you have scheduled a transfer in advance then we will notify you 24 hours before your upcoming transfer, setting out the total fees and the estimated ‘live’ exchange rate for that transfer. By scheduling a transfer, you agree to TW sending the funds using the live exchange rate at any time on the scheduled date. If you have opted in to receiving emails, we will send you a transfer receipt after successfully sending your scheduled transfer. For more information on scheduled transfers see our <a href="/help/a/2978063/what-are-scheduled-transfers">Help Centre</a>.</p>
<strong>Exchange rate.</strong>
<p>When we refer to an exchange rate in this Customer Agreement, it means the exchange rate at the relevant time for the relevant currency pair (for example, GBP to EUR, USD to AUD) that is offered by Wise, which is typically provided by a reference rate provider. We may change our reference rate provider from time to time without notice to you.</p>
<p>For some currencies, we do not use the mid-market exchange rate, including where we are required to use a different reference rate for the exchange rate for your currency pair. For example, for currency conversions to Nigeria (NGN), we are required to use the rate set by the Central Bank of Nigeria. For these currencies we will notify you of the exchange rate offered by Wise when you place your payment order.</p>
<strong>Guaranteed rates.</strong>
<p>We will notify you of the guaranteed rate and the guaranteed time period (the "Guaranteed Period") when you create your Money Transfer. Guaranteed Periods are subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(a) The Guaranteed Period may be extended if your Money Transfer is created over the weekend or public holiday.</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(b) We must receive sufficient funds from you during the Guaranteed Period in order to convert your money at the guaranteed rate. You will see when we have received your money by logging into your Wise Account.</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(c) If we receive your funds after the Guaranteed Period, we will not be able to convert your money using the guaranteed rate and your transfer will become a non-guaranteed rate transfer. Accordingly, we may convert your money at the applicable exchange rate at the time we receive your money or we will email you and ask you if you want to proceed with your transfer at the new exchange rate.</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(d) If the relevant exchange rate (as provided by our reference exchange rate provider) changes by 5% or more during the Guaranteed Period, we can, at our option, suspend your transfer for a reasonable period of time or cancel your transfer and refund the money to you.</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(e) For certain currencies, including where you are sending from Japanese Yen (JPY), the guaranteed rate will only be offered after your address has been verified by us.</p>
<p class="m-b-0 m-l-2">(f) We may change these guaranteed rate conditions or suspend the guarantee rate feature at any time.</p>
<strong>Auto Conversion.</strong>
<p>For certain currencies, you may be able to set one or more conversion orders to be automatically executed once the exchange rate you pick is offered by our Services (an “auto conversion order”). There may be limits to the number of auto conversion orders you are able to set up, as well as the amounts of money you can schedule to convert. Wise does not guarantee that it will be able to execute your auto conversion order in all circumstances.</p>
<strong>We are not a currency trading platform.</strong>
<p>Wise is not a currency trading platform, and accordingly, you should not use our Services, including the Wise Account or the auto conversion order function for this purpose (including creating multiple auto conversion orders or a series of Money Transfers without the intention of completing them or for seeking to profit from FX trading). If we detect that you are using our Services for this purpose, we may, at in our sole discretion, set a limit on the number of auto conversion orders you may create, cancel your orders, set a limit on the amount of money you can convert or transfer in one or more currencies or in the same currency, restrict your ability to use this or other features, or suspend or close your Wise Account and disgorge your gains.</p>

<p><strong>Personal, family or household</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to cancel a Transfer order for personal, family or household purposes and obtain a full refund of all funds paid to us, including any fees in connection with that order, within thirty (30) minutes of payment for the currency conversion order.</p>
<p>Transfer orders may be canceled from the website or application. You can also cancel your transfer by contacting us by telephone at 1-844-926-4389, or submitting a request in writing through the <a href="/help">Help Center</a>.

<p>We will issue a refund within three (3) Business Days of your request, provided that the funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient prior to our receipt of your request for a refund. For the avoidance of doubt, you may not cancel an order under any circumstances if the funds have been disbursed or deposited to the recipient.</p>
<p>We may refund canceled Transfer orders that were initiated from funds held in your Borderless Account directly back into your Borderless Account . You may withdraw the refunded amount following the steps in section <strong>Transferring Money or Withdrawing Money from your Borderless Account</strong>.

<p><strong>Issues that May Occur</strong></p>
<p><a name="reversals-and-chargebacks"></a><strong>Reversals and Chargebacks</strong></p>
<p>If you receive a payment that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee described below). &nbsp;Whenever a transaction is reversed, Wise will refund or reverse the transaction from your Wise Account in the same currency as the original transaction. &nbsp;If your Wise Account balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, Wise will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction, subject to the exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time. &nbsp;For details about what happens if your Wise Account balance becomes negative, please see <a href="#negative-account-balances">Negative Account Balances</a> below.</p>
<strong>Payments that are reversed</strong>
<p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by Wise if:</p>
<ul class="c19 lst-kix_list_14-0 start">
<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal (sometimes known as an ACH return) finds that the transaction was fraudulent.</li>
<li>Wise sent the payment to you in error.</li>
<li>The payment was unauthorized.</li>
<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this Customer Agreement, the <a href="/us/acceptable-use-policy-inc">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, or any other agreement between you and Wise.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to Wise for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Chargeback Fees</strong></p>
<p>If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your Wise Account and you (or a third party) pursue a chargeback for the transaction with the card issuer, then Wise may assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) and will remove the charged back funds from your Borderless account including funds held in a Jar.</p>
<p><a name="negative-account-balances"></a><strong>Negative Balances</strong></p>
<p>If your Wise Account goes into a negative amount, including as a result of a chargeback, reversal of a transaction, deduction of fees or any other action carried by you or a third party, that negative amount represents an amount you owe to Wise and you promise to repay the negative amount immediately without any notice from us. We may send you reminders or take such other reasonable actions to recover the negative amount from you, for example, we may use a debt collection service or take further legal actions. We may charge you for any costs we may incur as a result of these collection efforts.</p>
<p><a name="error-resolution"></a><strong>Error Resolution</strong></p>
<p>You must make sure that the information you provide to us when you send or withdraw money, or convert currency, is accurate. Once a transaction is processed, it cannot be reversed (except where, and to the extent, required by applicable law) and, except as expressly set forth in this Customer Agreement, we will not be liable in any way for any loss you suffer as a result of a transaction being carried out in accordance with your instructions (or a third party acting on your behalf).</p>

<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the currency conversion order receipt or were not delivered, unless, extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances, or delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or the transfer was made with fraudulent intent; and</li>
<li>The list of Transfers on our Website does not reflect a Transfer that you made; and</li>
<li>You did not receive any confirmation of your Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Transfer occurred.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will inform you of our determination within three (3) Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no Error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of any documents we used in our investigation.

<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your Borderless Account.</li>
</ul>

If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Borderless Account within ten (10) Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your account. &nbsp;For new Borderless Accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your Borderless Account for the amount you think is in error. &nbsp;We will tell you the results within three (3) Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Wise&rsquo;s Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Limitation on Wise&rsquo;s Liability, Indemnity and Release</strong></p>
<p>In this section, we use the term &ldquo;Wise&rdquo; to include Wise US Inc., and our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint venturers, service providers and suppliers. &nbsp;Our affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.</p>
<p>In no event shall Wise be liable for lost profits or for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind, under any contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or other theory, including damages for loss of profits, use or data, loss of other intangibles, loss of business, loss of security of any information or other materials (including unauthorized interception by third parties of any information or other materials), even if advised in advance of the possibility of such damages or losses, however arising, including negligence, unless and to the extent prohibited by law. Our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the actual amount of direct damages.</p>
<p>In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Wise is not liable, and you agree not to hold Wise responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill, or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from: (1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, API, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the Services; (2) delays or disruptions in our Website software, API, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Services) operated by us or on our behalf and any of the Services; (3) viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing our websites, API, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Services) operated by us or on our behalf &nbsp;or any of the Services or any website or service linked to our websites, software &nbsp;or any of the Services; (4) glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Services) operated by us or on our behalf or any of the Services or in the information and graphics obtained from them; (5) the content, actions, or inactions of third parties; (6) a suspension or other action taken with respect to your Wise Account; or (7) your need to modify your practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this Customer Agreement or any other Wise policy.</p>
<strong>Indemnity</strong>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited under applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Wise and its affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns, from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses and fees (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or relating to (a) your or your authorized third parties use of, or activities in connection with, the Services; and (b) any violation or alleged violation by you of this Customer Agreement or applicable law.</p>
<strong>Release</strong>
<p>If you have a dispute with any other Wise Account holder or a third party that you send money to or receive money from using the Services, you release Wise from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise, for example, California Civil Code &sect; 1542) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
<strong>Service Availability</strong>
<p>We will try to make sure our Services are available to you when you need them. However, we do not guarantee that our Services will always be available or be uninterrupted. We have the right to suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of our Service without notice. We will not be liable to you if for any reason our Services are unavailable (in whole or in part) at any time or for any period. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services (including all hardware and telecommunications services).</p>
<strong>Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>
<p>The Services are provided &ldquo;As-Is&rdquo; &ldquo;Where Is&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where Available&rdquo; and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory. Wise specifically disclaims any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We disclaim all warranties with respect to the Services to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, including the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and title.</p>
<strong>Insolvency Proceedings</strong>
<p>If any type of bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding (e.g., a proceeding commenced under any provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code) is commenced by or against you, we&rsquo;ll be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Customer Agreement or objections that we supply information in connection with such proceeding.</p>

<strong>Miscellaneous Translation of This Customer Agreement</strong>
<p>Any translation of this Customer Agreement is provided solely for your convenience and is not intended to modify the terms of this Customer Agreement. Only the English language of the Customer Agreement version is an official version. In the event of a conflict between the English version of this Customer Agreement and a version in a language other than English, the English version shall control.</p>
<strong>Privacy</strong>
<p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Please review our <a href="/us/privacy-policy-inc">Privacy Policy</a> in order to better understand our commitment to maintaining your privacy, as well as our use and disclosure of your information.</p>
<strong>Governing law and Agreement to Arbitrate </strong>
<p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law and except as otherwise stated in this Customer Agreement, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Customer Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Wise, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Wise, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Wise and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a>. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</p>
<strong>Wise is a payment service provider</strong>
<p>Our relationship with you under this Customer Agreement with you is as a payment service provider, and Wise is an independent contractor for all purposes. &nbsp;Wise is not your agent or trustee.</p>
<strong>Copyright Infringement Claims</strong>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to Wise a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that Wise remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to Wise a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Wise as follows: By mail to Wise Legal Counsel, 30 W 26th Street, Floor 6, New York, NY 10010; by e-mail to legal@wise.com.</p>
<strong>Unlawful internet gambling notice</strong>
<p>Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through your Wise Account or your relationship with Wise. &nbsp;Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, transactions in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with unlawful Internet gambling.</p>
<strong>Export Controls</strong>
<p>You are responsible for complying with United States export controls and for any violation of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. You represent, warrant and covenant that you are not (a) located in, or a resident or a national of, any country subject to a U.S. government embargo, <b>a country on a U.S. sanctions list</b> or other restriction, or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country; or (b) on any of the U.S. government lists of restricted end users.</p>
<strong>Other Information About this Customer Agreement</strong>
<p>You may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under this Customer Agreement without Wise's prior written consent. Wise may transfer or assign this Customer Agreement or any right or obligation under this Customer Agreement at any time.</p>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of this Customer Agreement operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect. If we delay in asking you to do certain things or in taking action, it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this Customer Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
<p>This Customer Agreement, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein, is the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings. &nbsp;This Agreement is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and us.</p>

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Wise, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Wise and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u0026ldquo;AAA\u0026rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement.

The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator\u0026rsquo;s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWise is a payment service provider\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eOur relationship with you under this Customer Agreement with you is as a payment service provider, and Wise is an independent contractor for all purposes. \u0026nbsp;Wise is not your agent or trustee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eCopyright Infringement Claims\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \u0026ldquo;DMCA\u0026rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and Wise, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Wise and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u0026ldquo;AAA\u0026rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at \u003ca href=\"https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf\"\u003ehttps://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf\u003c/a\u003e. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator\u0026rsquo;s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWise is a payment service provider\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eOur relationship with you under this Customer Agreement with you is as a payment service provider, and Wise is an independent contractor for all purposes. \u0026nbsp;Wise is not your agent or trustee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eCopyright Infringement Claims\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \u0026ldquo;DMCA\u0026rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.
