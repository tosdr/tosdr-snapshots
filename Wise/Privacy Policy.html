<h3>8. Sharing and storing your personal data <span class="pull-right-single-direction"><a href="##" title="We store your personal data mainly in the UK and the EU. In cases where we share your personal data to other places, we ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place."></a></span></h3>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>8.1</strong> While our main processing centres are in the UK and the EU, we may transfer your data to and store it in countries outside of your jurisdiction, which do not offer an equivalent level of protection to your country. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of your jurisdiction. Such staff may be engaged in activities that include the fulfilment of your payment order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>8.2</strong> In the above cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses and/or International Data Transfer Agreements, are in place. A copy of these documents can be provided by sending a request to privacy@wise.com.</p>
<p><strong>8.3</strong> In Switzerland, we ensure that such safeguards are in place unless we can rely on an exception. An exception may apply, for example, in case of legal proceedings abroad, but also in cases of overriding public interest or if the performance of a contract requires disclosure, if you have consented or if data has been made available generally by you and you have not objected against the processing.</p>

<h3>9. Profiling and automated decision making <span class="pull-right-single-direction"><a href="##" title="We might use some of your personal data to inform you about any new updates that might be useful for you. We also use automated processes to verify you and to help prevent any illegal activity. Such decisions as to reject your application or to close your account, can be taken automatically. In the cases above, you can always contact us."></a></span></h3>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>9.1</strong> We may use some elements of your data to customise our Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your needs, including your country of residence and transaction history. For example, if you frequently send funds from one particular currency to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you. When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security are protected - and we use pseudonymised data wherever possible. This activity has no legal effect on you.</p>
<p><strong>9.2</strong> We use automated processes to check that your application to access Wise services and your use of Wise services meet our required standard, including verifying your identity, and to help prevent fraud or other illegal activities. These processes may make an automated decision to reject your application or a proposed transaction, to block a suspicious attempt to login to your Wise account, or to close your account. If this happens, you will be notified and offered the opportunity to provide further information and challenge the decision through an appeal mechanism, which includes a manual review. In any case, if you feel that an automated process may have impacted you, please contact Wise Customer Support.</p>

<h3>11. Data retention <span class="pull-right-single-direction"><a href="##" title="We keep your personal data only as long as it is needed. Once we do not need it or when the law requires us to delete it, we will do so in a secure way."></a></span></h3>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>11.1</strong> We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it. As a regulated financial institution, Wise is required by law to store some of your personal and transactional data beyond the closure of your account with us. We only access your data internally on a need-to-know basis, and we’ll only access or process it if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>11.2</strong> We will always delete data that is no longer required by a relevant law or jurisdiction in which we operate. We do this automatically, so you don’t need to contact us to ask us to delete your data. Deletion methods include shredding, destruction and secure disposal of hardware and hard-copy records, and deletion or over-writing of digital data.</p>

All payment service providers participating in the Programme provide the same information to Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>12.2</strong> The processing purposes and interests are i) required by Amazon to help them prevent and detect crime and to uphold the standards of conduct required by Amazon and ii) to help Wise prevent and detect crime.</p>
<p><strong>12.3</strong> In the UK, EEA, Indonesia, Türkiye, and Brazil, the lawful basis for processing is legitimate interests. The interests and processing purposes are as described in section 12.2.</p>
<p><strong>12.4</strong> In jurisdictions outside the UK, EEA, Indonesia, Türkiye and Brazil, you consent to this data sharing by continuing to use your Wise account.</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>13.1</strong> Laws applicable in your jurisdiction may grant you certain rights regarding the information we hold about you. If you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, contact us at privacy@wise.com.</p>
<p><strong>13.2</strong> Your exercise of these rights may be subject to certain exemptions, including to safeguard the public interest (including the prevention or detection of crime), where it is in our interests (including the maintenance of legal privilege), and where the rights of other persons are involved (including where your request relates to information about other individuals).</p>
<p><strong>13.3</strong> We may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes and to comply with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to our anti-money laundering obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion.</p>
<p><strong>13.4</strong> You will not normally have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee where permitted by local laws or if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>13.5</strong> We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>13.6</strong> If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us, you may opt-out by following the instructions in any such email. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt-out.</p>
<p><strong>13.7</strong> If you would like to make a request, the best way to do so would be to contact us at the contact details listed in the Appendix.</p>
<p><strong>13.8</strong> <strong>Subject to some country-specific variations, you have the right to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</strong> We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li><strong>Ask us to delete personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it.</strong> You may also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data where (i) you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), (ii) where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or (iii) where we are required to delete your personal data to comply with local law. We may not always be able to comply with your deletion request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, in our response to your request, including financial regulations that may require us to hold your personal data for a period after the closure of your account.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw your consent for us to process data, where our lawful basis for processing is based on that consent.</strong> Note that withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing which may have taken place prior to withdrawal of consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.</li>
<li><strong>Request us to cease direct marketing to you, or profiling you for the purpose of direct marketing,</strong> by contacting us or adjusting your notification preferences in the settings section of your account.</li>
<li><strong>Where we use wholly automated decision making-processes, request that we provide information about the decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that an automated decision that results in a legal impact on you has been made correctly.</strong> We may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime. However, generally in these circumstances we will verify that the algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias or if required by law to adjust the processing.</li>
<li><strong>Object to any processing based on the legitimate interests ground when there is something about your particular situation where you feel processing on this ground impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following situations</strong>: (i) if you want us to determine the data's accuracy; (ii) where our processing of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it at this time; (iii) where you wish us to retain the data even if we no longer require it because you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to us using your data but we need to confirm whether or not we have over-riding legitimate grounds to continue using it.</li>
<li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to a third party or yourself.</strong> We will provide you or your chosen third party with the personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right applies only to information where we used the information to perform a contract with you or where you initially consented for us to use it.</li>
