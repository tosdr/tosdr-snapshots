<p>A. <span style="font-weight: 400;">MooCash Application</span></p>
<p>When you download the MooCash Application, you will be prompted to register for an End User Account, and MooCash may then begin displaying Ad Content on the lockscreen of your mobile phone. After that, all of your interactions with MooCash will be recorded, stored in our servers, and associated with your End User Account. Among other things, your End User Account will keep track of your Coins, your Coins redemption options, and your Coins redemption history. YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCRUE, RECEIVE AND STORE COINS WHEN SIGNED INTO YOUR END USER ACCOUNT. From time to time, at MooCash&#8217;s sole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your Coins for products and services.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to receive Coins using the MooCash Application. The simplest way is by engaging with MooCash by moving the lockscreen unlock slider (i) to the right to unlock your phone, or (ii) to the left to engage with the Ad Content. For example, if you slide left to take an offer, you may receive Coins. MooCash recommends that you use your smartphone or mobile device as you normally do and that you engage only with Ad Content that genuinely interests you.</p>
<p>A. MooJoy<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Application</span></p>
<p>When you download the MooJoy Application, you will be prompted to register for an End User Account. If you register for an End User Account, all of your interactions with MooJoy will be recorded, stored in our servers, and associated with your End User Account. The MooJoy Application gives you Gems, which you can then use to play games to win Coins. Among other things, your End User Account will keep track of your Coins and Gems, your Coins redemption options, and your Coins redemption history. From time to time, at MooJoy&#8217;s sole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your Coins for products and services.</p>
<p>C. Applications Generally</p>
<p>Whether you are using the MooCash Application or the MooJoy Application, or both, your Coins and Gems balance (“Rewards”) will be reflected in your End User Account. If you use both Applications to acquire Rewards, your End User Account will reflect the entire balance of Rewards from both Applications. Depending on the current value of a Coins, which will be determined at MooCash’s sole and absolute discretion, you may, from time to time, redeem them for products and services, and or convert them into charitable contributions.</p>
<p>Rewards obtained via the Applications are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license. Rewards may not be transferred or resold in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct sale or auction service. You have no property interest, right or title in or to any such Rewards appearing or originating in the Applications, or any other attributes associated with use of MooCash or its Applications. Any Reward balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT MOOCASH DOES NOT AND CANNOT PROMISE OR GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY NUMBER OF REWARDS OR THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY AMOUNT OF AD CONTENT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY AMOUNT OF VALUE, MONETARY OR OTHERWISE, WHEN YOU REDEEM YOUR COINS. MooCash’s ability to provide Rewards depends on whether, and how much, MooCash gets paid by the relevant Advertiser, and due to the complex nature of its relationships with Advertisers, whether MooCash gets paid, and how much, may vary over time. We will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate of Rewards, which may be modified at any time. The availability and exchange rate for Rewards may vary for a variety of reasons, such as non-payment by Advertisers or changes in our arrangements with Advertisers or in applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Rewards at any time for any reason. All redemptions are subject to this Agreement and any third-party terms associated with Advertisers.</p>
<p>As noted, each time you receive Rewards, we place the Rewards in your End User Account. Your ability to receive and redeem Rewards is conditioned on your compliance with the Agreement. You may access your End User Account to modify your account settings or to review your Reward balances and Coins redemption choices. You may login by entering your username and password with the Applications or through the Site.</p>
<p>You may log into your End User Account to redeem your accumulated Coins. While we reserve the right to modify when and how you can redeem Coins at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, as of the “Last Updated” date of this Agreement set forth below.</p>
<p>When using the MooCash or MooJoy Application, any Coins earned will be immediately redeemable. For both Applications, however, the Coins remain the property of MooCash, not you, at all times.</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to terminate your End User Account at any time for breach of this Agreement. You will no longer be able to use any Rewards in your End User Account after termination. We may do this without prior notice, but may attempt to notify you afterward where feasible.</p>
<h3><b>Fraud</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using fraudulent information to complete offers and/or completing offers with fraudulent intent will result in the member&#8217;s account being deleted without notice and relinquishment of any and all rewards that have accrued in the account. Fraud includes, but is not limited to, the following: using false information to complete offers; using information that is not one&#8217;s own to complete offers; completing the same offer multiple times; or canceling offers and/or trials prior to receipt of a product and/or service that is required for a given reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple signups by any individual user shall be grounds for immediate termination of all involved accounts. The Company reserves the right to file charges against an individual in attempt to recover any rewards received. We have a tough anti-fraud system in place making it extremely difficult to commit fraud or &#8220;hacking&#8221;, however if someone is caught committing fraud, or making attempts to do so, we reserve the right to suspend the user&#8217;s account, resulting in forfeiture of all rewards.</span></p>

<p>This app uses Pollfish SDK. Pollfish is an on-line survey platform, through which, anyone may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with Developers of applications for smartphones in order to have access to users of such applications and address survey questionnaires to them. When a user connects to this app, a specific set of user&#8217;s device data (including Advertising ID which will may be processed by Pollfish only in strict compliance with google play policies- and/or other device data) and response meta-data is automatically sent to Pollfish servers, in order for Pollfish to discern whether the user is eligible for a survey. For a full list of data received by Pollfish through this app, please read carefully Pollfish respondent terms located at https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent. These data will be associated with your answers to the questionnaires whenever Pollfish sents such questionnaires to eligible users. By downloading the application you accept this privacy policy document and you hereby give your consent for the processing by Pollfish of the aforementioned data. Furthermore, you are informed that you may disable Pollfish operation at any time by using the Pollfish “opt out section” available on Pollfish website . We once more invite you to check the respondent&#8217;s terms of use, if you wish to have more detailed view of the way Pollfish works.

<h3><b>Cashback</b></h3>
<p>Cashback not applicable to taxes, delivery charges, gift cards, returns, exchanges and cancellations and purchases made using mobile app. MooBucks Application must be the last link you clicked in order to get cashback. If other website links like coupon and deal websites are clicked after clicking through MooBucks Application, cashback will not be tracked. Accounts that engage in fraudulent orders/activities to game/cheat the cashback system will be banned and cashback forfeited. Cashback is only paid on legitimate transactions. Usage of promotional or coupon codes not posted and approved by MooBucks Application may affect your eligibility for cashback. Users are required to click through MooBucks’s Application &#8220;Shop&#8221; button and complete purchase wholly within the same redirected tab/window to qualify for cashback. If you face any payment error, redo your purchase process by re-clicking through MooBucks Application to ensure tracking remains active. Whilst the vast majority of transactions from merchants track successfully, occasionally a transaction may not get reported. If you believe this to be the case, please submit a &#8216;Missing Cashback&#8217; query within 100 days of the transaction, as we will be unable to chase up older claims. Please note that some merchants may not be forthcoming with untracked cashback. We endeavour to chase untracked cashback but reserve the right to halt enquiries at any time. Our ability to pay cashback on an order is dependent on the Affiliate Store paying us first. Unfortunately, at times for various reasons, the Affiliate Store does not recognise an order as valid and as such would not pay us for it. While we typically seek to make a case before the Affiliate Store for payment, unfortunately, we are unable to credit cashback unless and until such payment is received.</p>
