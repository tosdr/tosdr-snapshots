Dispute Resolution, Arbitration of Claims, and Class Action Waiver</strong></h3><p>YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p><p><strong>10.1 Dispute Resolution.</strong> You may contact us at optout@qualified.com to address any concerns you may have regarding the Services. Qualified is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our Customers’ satisfaction. You and Qualified agree to use commercially reasonable efforts through Qualified’s internal dispute resolution processes to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations, which shall be a condition to either party initiating arbitration or a lawsuit.</p><p><strong>10.2 Arbitration. </strong>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time of the commencement of informal dispute resolution under the initial dispute resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Any claim that you might have against Qualified must be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association using its Commercial Arbitration Rules and must be brought within one (1) year of the claim arising.</p><p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL ARBITRATE WITH QUALIFIED IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL OR CORPORATE CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS. Your claim may not be joined with any claim of any other person, and there shall not be authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions in this Section shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p><p>You understand and agree that unless you can demonstrate to Qualified that arbitration in California would create an undue burden for you, any arbitration hearing will be held in San Francisco County, California. If your claim is successful in arbitration, Qualified agrees to reimburse your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement, you and Qualified are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this arbitration provision, you and Qualified might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p><p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights) or Confidential Information.</p><p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Qualified.com Inc., 450 Mission Street, Suite 204, San Francisco, CA 94105. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Qualified also will not be bound by them.</p><p><strong>10.3 Venue. </strong>For any dispute not subject to arbitration, you and Qualified agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p><p><strong>10.4 Injunctive Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding the above provisions, Qualified may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p><h3><strong>11.
