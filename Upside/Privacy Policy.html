In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.<br/><br/><strong>Agents, Consultants and Service Providers:</strong> Upside, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such third party providers include advertising networks, data analytics providers, productivity application providers, cloud storage providers, customer service platforms, and personnel management vendors. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.<br/><br/><strong>Legal Requirements: </strong>Upside may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or enable a third party partner to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Upside, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p><p class="getupside-font-regular">For residents of California and Virginia, for the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act respectively, we do not sell your Personal Data. For residents of California, for the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act, we do not share your Personal Data. For residents of Virginia, for the purposes of the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, we do not use your Personal Data to engage in targeted advertising. To the extent that Upside collects Personal Data that constitutes “sensitive personal information” or “sensitive personal data” as those terms are defined under California or Virginia law, Upside limits the use of such Personal Data only to the uses necessarily to perform the Services. Please note that we may share Personal Data in connection with a Business Transfer, as described above.<br/></p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Your Choices:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you wish to use the Services, it is necessary to provide certain Personal Data such a login information to create an account and transaction information to accept Cash Back rewards offers. As outlined above, certain Personal Data is integral to enabling certain features of the Services.<br/><br/>If you choose not to provide certain Personal Data, you may not be able to use all features of the Services. This includes referral bonuses that Upside offers in exchange for sharing your personal contacts so that Upside can offer its Services to other users.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive"><strong>Exercising Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data:</strong></h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">We may offer you choices that affect how we handle the Personal Data that we control.  Consistent with the laws that may apply to your place of residence, you may request the following in relation to your Personal Data:<br/></p><p class="getupside-font-regular px-40"><strong>Information:</strong> You may request information about how we have collected and used your Personal Data. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Access:</strong> If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data along with certain other details. If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Withdrawal of Consent: </strong>In circumstances where you have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw consent for that specific processing at any time.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Objection/Restriction: </strong>You may also ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest its accuracy or object to us processing it. If you exercise your rights, we will respect your decision in accordance with our legal obligations.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Correction: </strong>You may request the correction of Personal Data that is inaccurate or out of date.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Deletion</strong>:<strong> </strong>You may request the deletion of Personal Data that we no longer need to provide the Services or for other lawful purposes.<br/></p><p class="getupside-font-regular">Upside will not discriminate against you for exercising either of these rights. However, a request to delete your Personal Data will include the deletion of your login credentials, and thus your Upside account, which will prevent you from continuing to use the Services.<br/><br/>To exercise your rights regarding your Personal Data, the following methods are available:</p><ul role="list" class="getupside-list-privacy"><li class="getupside-list-item-privacy"><div class="getupside-list-paragraph">From a mobile device with the Upside application installed, click this <a href="upsideapp://deeplink/ccpa_request">link</a>;</div></li><li class="getupside-list-item-privacy"><div class="getupside-list-paragraph">Access the Help Center in the Upside application and select “Submit a Privacy Request,” under the “Consumer Privacy” heading; or</div></li><li class="getupside-list-item-privacy"><div class="getupside-list-paragraph">Email privacy@upside.com with the subject line PRIVACY REQUEST.

Upside may require additional information from you for verification purposes. In accordance with applicable law, Upside will require you to re-enter your login credentials in the mobile application prior to our handling of your request regarding your Personal Data. If we cannot verify your identity, we will not process your request regarding your Personal Data.<br/><br/>Where permitted by applicable laws and regulations, you may also submit a request regarding your Personal Data through an authorized agent. If you do so, the agent must present signed written permission from you to act on your behalf and you may also be required to independently verify your identity with us.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Children:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">Upside prohibits the use of the Services by anyone under the age of 16 years. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 16, you may not create an Upside account or submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet and mobile device usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has created an Upside account or provided Personal Data to Upside through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that account and/or information.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Exclusions:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Upside (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Upside endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Integrating Social Networking Services:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">One of the special features of the Service is that it allows you to enable or log in to the Services via various social networking services like Google, Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Service(s)”). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or grant us permission via the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Upside shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.<br/><br/>You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Security:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">Upside takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Upside via the Internet.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive">Changes to Upside’s Privacy Policy:</h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Upside to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Upside reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, by sending a notice to you and other Service visitors and posting a notice on the Site. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after you receive notice of any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.</p><h2 class="getupside-h2-policy mg-top-bottom-responsive"><strong>Contacting Upside:</strong></h2><p class="getupside-font-regular">Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about Upside’s Privacy Policy or the information practices of the Services, including if you need access to our Privacy Policy in a different format.<br/><br/>You may contact us as follows:</p><ul role="list" class="getupside-list-privacy"><li class="getupside-list-item-privacy"><div class="getupside-list-paragraph">Email support@upside.com; or</div></li><li class="getupside-list-item-privacy"><div class="getupside-list-paragraph">Access the Help Center in the Upside application and click the blue pen icon in the upper right hand corner to initiate a conversation.</div></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer" class="footer-wrapper"><div class="container-default w-container"><div class="footer-content-wrapper"><a href="/" class="footer-logo-link w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ff7b678c2b03cb7b788c27/64f21b3e7d6477504d958653_upside-logo-white.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Logo Upside"/></a><div class="footer-inner-wrapper"><div class="footer-left-column"><div class="footer-column"><a href="/" class="link-no-decoration w-inline-block"><h3 class="footer-title">for app users</h3></a><ul role="list" class="footer-list"><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="https://upside.app.link/yWesndCrXxb" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Get the app</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/find-offers" class="footer-link">Find offers</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="https://support.upside.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Customer support</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column"><a href="/business" class="link-no-decoration w-inline-block"><h3 class="footer-title">For Business</h3></a><ul role="list" class="footer-list"><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/business/fuel-and-convenience" class="footer-link">Fuel &amp; convenience</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/business/grocery" class="footer-link">Grocery</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/business/restaurant" class="footer-link">Restaurant</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/business/resources/insights" class="footer-link">Resources &amp; insights</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/business/loyalty-and-upside" class="footer-link">Customer loyalty</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="https://dashboard.upside-services.com/" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Dashboard login</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column"><a href="/partnerships" class="link-no-decoration w-inline-block"><h3 class="footer-title no-hover">Partnerships</h3></a><ul role="list" class="footer-list"><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/partnerships/tech-integration" class="footer-link">Tech integrations</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/partnerships" class="footer-link">Marketing partnerships</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/partnerships/affiliate" class="footer-link">Affiliates</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column"><h3 class="footer-title no-hover">Company</h3><ul role="list" class="footer-list"><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/about" class="footer-link">About</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/about/careers" class="footer-link">Careers</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/about/team" class="footer-link">Team</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/newsroom" class="footer-link">Newsroom</a></li><li class="footer-list-item"><a href="/blog" class="footer-link">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-right-column"><a id="cta-user-app-store" href="https://upside.app.link/yWesndCrXxb" target="_blank" class="link-apps-store tvsquared-tracking w-inline-block"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ff7b678c2b03cb7b788c27/64346d8266699711344c7876_apple.svg" loading="eager" alt="BTN Apple -
