For more information, contact the relevant third-party provider. It is possible that you will also come across third-party cookies on some pages of sites that are not under our control, please refer to the section below on Links to Third-Party Sites for information on those activities. We may also use cookies to track whether you open emails we send to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em>. Pages of our Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</p>
<p><em>Pixel Tracking</em>. In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ "pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our products, services, and offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing, research, and other activities.</p>
<p><em>GIF</em>. We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our emails.</p>
<p><em>Log Files</em>. Our servers (or those of our service providers) may automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Website. These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Website you visited, your internet protocol ("IP") address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Website. These log files are generally deleted periodically.</p>
<p>The information we collect using online tracking technologies may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage Data: Details of your visits to our Website or use of the Mobile App, including, but not limited to, website traffic data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website or Mobile App.</li>
<li>Device Information: Information about your computer, mobile device, and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, browser type, clickstream patterns, the URL of the most recent website you visited before coming to our Website, the amount of time you spent on our Website or using the Mobile App, and the pages you viewed while on our Website.</li>
<li>Location Data: We collect and use IP address and mailing address for marketing purposes, e.g., to set parameters for different types of communications based on geographic information (such as zip code). Our marketing or advertising service providers may use location data (via IP address) to automatically display advertising on your device based on where you are at a point in time in relation to a particular location (for example, a shopping mall). We do not store your momentary geolocation data (i.e., time or precise place), though various third parties such as Google or Waze may for their own purposes, if you have given them permission to do so.</li>
<li>Behavioral Tracking: We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services, or associate Personal Information with other information collected in this manner.</li>
<li>Keystrokes: We or our service providers may keep track of and/or collect the keystrokes, mouse clicks, and cursor movements of Website visitors and Mobile App users before purchase of a Product or Service from our Website (and before we have any email address or other information about you (other than IP address) which would specifically identify you). If you sign up to receive our emails (e.g., through a popup box that appears) we then do have the ability going forward to associate the keystroke and cursor information with the email address you provide. We use this information for the purpose of improving our Website, Mobile App, Products, and Services, and to improve our customers' user experience.</li>
<li>Analytics Data: The Site also uses analytics tools such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. that uses cookies to help us analyze how users navigate the Site. The information generated by this tool (including IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google in aggregate form and used to evaluate use of the Site, compile reports on Site activity and other services relating to Site usage. You can learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect from Third Parties</em></strong>. We may collect information that others provide about you when you use the Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Platform. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Third Party Services</em>. If you link, connect, or login to your account with a third-party social media service (e.g., Facebook, Google, Instagram, Yelp, etc.), the third-party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</li>
<li><em>Other Sources</em>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third-party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website or Mobile App are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. First party or third-party cookies may be used alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website or Mobile App. The information that first party and third-party cookies collect may be associated with your Personal Information or they may collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services (i.e., tracking such activities).

<p><strong>Managing and Opting Out of Online Tracking</strong></p>
<p>You can adjust the settings on your browser to block or opt out of certain cookies and other online tracking, including those used for targeted or cross-contextual advertising.

You can also find out more about cookies and how to manage them by visiting www.AboutCookies.org.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals</strong></p>
<p>Some browsers have a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity online tracking technologies. While we continue to evaluate this evolving technology, our Website does not currently respond to browser-based DNT signals. For information regarding DNT and how to enable this setting, if available, on your devices please see <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">https://allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on your state of residence, you may have additional rights or choices as further described in the state-specific notices below.</p>
<p><strong>California Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p>This California Privacy Notice section ("CA Notice") describes how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information of California residents within the scope of the California Privacy Protection Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CCPA").</p>
<p>Unless otherwise defined in this CA Notice, all terms defined in this Privacy Policy and all other terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this CA Notice.</p>
<p>This CA Notice supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and applies to personal information of residents of California ("consumers" or "you"), collected, used, disclosed, or otherwise processed by or on behalf of GOLO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong></p>
<p>In this CA Notice, "personal information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household in accordance with the CCPA. Personal information does not include: a) de-identified, aggregated or anonymized information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or linked to you or a particular household; or b) publicly available information from government records.</p>
<p><br>We process the categories of personal information further described in the "Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It" section of this Privacy Policy and as shown in the table below.</p>

For purposes of this CA Notice, when we use the term "third party" we mean entities that are not a GOLO entity or processors providing services on behalf of GOLO and that are not entities with whom you interact with directly.<br></p>

<p><strong>Colorado Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Colorado Privacy Notice section ("CO Notice") describes how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise processes personal data of Colorado residents within the scope of the Colorado Privacy Act, including its implementing regulations ("CPA").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless otherwise defined in this CO Notice, all terms defined in this Privacy Policy and all other terms defined in the CPA have the same meaning when used in this CO Notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This CO Notice supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and applies to personal data of residents of Colorado ("consumers" or "you"), collected, used, disclosed, or otherwise processed by or on behalf of GOLO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Data</em></strong></p>
<p>In this CO Notice, "personal data" means information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual who can be readily identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, specific geolocation data, or an online identifier. Personal data does not include: a) de-identified data that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, an identified or identifiable individual, or a device linked to such an individual; b) publicly available information that is lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records and that we have a reasonable basis to believe a consumer has lawfully made available to the general public through widely distributed media without restrictions; or c) information about an individual acting in a commercial or employment context, as a job applicant, or as a beneficiary of someone acting in an employment context.<br></p>
<p>We process the categories of personal data further described in the "Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It" section of this Privacy Policy and as shown in the table below.<br></p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Data Recipients<br></em></strong>As described further in the "How We Disclose Your Personal Information" section of this Privacy Policy, we share personal data with service providers or processors that help us operate our Platform and Services and provide our Products. We may also share personal data with a variety of third parties, including for marketing purposes; if we are subject to certain corporate transactions or reorganizations; with third parties to comply with law or to protect our rights or the rights and safety of others; or for purposes otherwise disclosed or for which you have consented. For purposes of this CO Notice, when we use the term "third party" we mean entities that are not a GOLO entity or processors providing services on behalf of GOLO and that are not entities with whom you interact with directly.<br></p>
<p>We have collected the categories of personal data as noted in the table below and disclosed it to the categories of third parties listed below. The table also indicates when we sold the personal data to third parties or processed such information for targeted advertising.<br></p>

<p>This VA/UT Notice supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and applies to personal data of residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia or the State of Utah ("consumers" or "you"), created, received, transmitted or maintained by or on behalf of GOLO.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Data</em></strong></p>
<p>In this VA/UT Notice, "personal data" means information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data does not include: a) deidentified data that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to link to an identified or identifiable person, or a device linked to such person; b) publicly available information from federal, state or local government records or information that we have a reasonable basis to believe was lawfully made available to the general public through widely distributed media without restrictions; c) information about job applicants, employees and other personnel; or d) information about the employees and other representatives of third-party entities who we may interact with in a commercial context. For Utah residents, aggregated data that relates to a group or category of consumers is also not personal data.</p>
<p>We process the categories of personal data further described in the "Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It" section of this Privacy Policy and as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Data Recipients</em></strong></p>
<p>As described further in the "How We Disclose Your Personal Information" section of this Privacy Policy, we share personal data with service providers or processors that help us operate our Platform and Services and provide our Products. We may also share personal data with a variety of third parties, including for marketing purposes; if we are subject to certain corporate transactions or reorganizations; with third parties to comply with law or to protect our rights or the rights and safety of others; or for purposes otherwise disclosed or for which you have consented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For purposes of this VA/UT Notice, when we use the term "third party" we mean entities that are not a GOLO entity or processors providing services on behalf of GOLO and that are not entities with whom you interact with directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have collected the categories of personal data as noted in the table below and disclosed it to the categories of third parties listed below. The table also indicates when we sold the personal data to third parties or processed such information for targeted advertising.</p>

<p><strong><em>How to Exercise Your Rights</em></strong></p>
<p>We will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of Virginia or Utah before processing most requests, which may require us to request additional personal data from you. In order to verify your identity, we will generally require either the successful authentication of your account, or the matching of information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. We will use the personal data provided in connection with a request as needed to review and comply with the request. If you do not provide the necessary information, we may not be able to verify or complete your request in all circumstances.<br></p>
<p>If you wish to submit a verifiable consumer request on behalf of a Virginia or Utah resident (including a minor child), we will also need sufficient information to verify that the individual is the person about whom we collected personal data and that you are authorized to submit the request on their behalf.<br></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above. If you are a Virginia resident and your request is denied, we will provide an explanation for the denial and instructions on how you may appeal a denied request. You may appeal a denied request by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@golo.com">privacy@golo.com</a>.</p>
