<p><strong>Shipping Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supplements &amp; Fitness products:</strong></p>
<p>GOLO ships orders of supplements &amp; fitness products to addresses in the United States (its territories) and Canada only. We ship all orders within 1-4 business days.</p>
<p>Orders are shipped via DHL, USPS, UPS, FEDEX or other comparable shippers. All shipments can be tracked online. Tracking instructions will be provided in your shipping confirmation email.</p>
<p>US Orders: We offer free shipping on all orders to all US addresses (typical delivery time frame is 2-5 business days based on when the package leaves our shipping location).</p>
<p>Some orders may be offered FedEx 2 Business-Day shipping for an additional fee. (This option is not available for all orders). If you choose this shipping method, please note that, if possible, the order will be shipped the same day. However, if your order is placed on a weekend or in the afternoon your order may not be shipped until the next business day. The day that the package ships does not count as a business day (for shipping purposes) because the package does not leave the warehouse until the end of the day. For example - orders shipped on Monday will arrive on Wednesday. FedEx 2 business day delivery does not include weekends. In some areas of the country FedEx delivers these packages over the weekend but it is not guaranteed, and weekends are not counted as business days. For example, orders shipped on Thursday will arrive on Monday by FedEx.</p>
<p>Canada Orders: The cost of shipping to all addresses within Canada is $25.00 USD. This fee covers shipping, duties, and taxes. Delivery time to Canada is typically 5-10 business days.</p>
<p><strong>Non-perishable food products: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Disputes; Resolution</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><u>Time Limitation</u>. Any claim or action against us must be brought within twelve (12) months of the cause arising, otherwise such claim or action is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration:</strong></p>
<p>Other than for the grounds set forth in the section below labeled “<u>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</u>”, in the event of any dispute, claim, question or disagreement arising from or relating to the Terms or the breach thereof, the parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. To this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach such solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, such dispute, claim, question or disagreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), subject to the limitations of this Section. This agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing and shall be final. Judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification, or appeal, except to the extent permitted by Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which Sections the parties agree shall apply. The expenses of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the AAA, shall be shared equally by the parties.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will have no authority to award attorneys’ fees, punitive damages, or any other monetary relief not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The award may include equitable relief. The arbitrator will not make any ruling, finding, or award that does not otherwise conform to the Terms. The arbitrator may render a summary disposition relative to all or some of the issues, provided that the responding party has had an adequate opportunity to respond to any such application for such disposition.</p>
<p>The parties agree to treat all aspects of the arbitration as confidential, as provided in the AAA Rules. Before making any disclosure permitted by the Rules, a party shall give written notice to the other party and afford such party a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. Further, judgment on the arbitrators’ award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>Class Action Waiver: Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. You agree that neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under these Terms or any disputes between the parties. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial: Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right we or you may have to a trial by jury for any legal action arising out of or relating to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.</strong></p>

<p><u>Governing Law</u>.&nbsp;For all legal proceedings arising out of use of the Website, the Products, or our Services, and/or relating to these Terms, these Terms and the relationship between you and us shall, irrespective of any choice of laws rules, be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Subject to the Arbitration clause set forth above, you and we hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, or the court of competent jurisdiction closest thereto if no court of competent jurisdiction resides therein, and the parties’ consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and expressly waive any right they may otherwise have to cause any such action or proceeding to be brought or tried elsewhere. You and we irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceeding brought in any such court or any claim that a legal proceeding commenced in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Survival</u>.&nbsp; Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration.</p>
<p><u>Headings</u>. The headings of sections and paragraphs in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect its interpretation.</p>
<p><u>Waiver</u>.&nbsp;The failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not affect our right to exercise or enforce such right or provision at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
<p><u>Severability</u>.&nbsp;If any portion of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in such provision, and, notwithstanding such finding, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.&nbsp;</p>
