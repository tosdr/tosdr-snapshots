        <strong>Welcome to the privacy policy of Aternos,</strong><br />

        We take the protection of your data very seriously and store only what we have to. In this policy, we will try
        to explain as good and comprehensible as possible which data we store and why.
        <br/><br/>
        If you have any questions regarding your data, you can always write to us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e393918a9582809aa3829786918d8c90cd8c9184">[email&#160;protected]</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        Legally responsible for the protection of your data is the Aternos GmbH:
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Aternos GmbH</strong><br />
        Konrad-Adenauer-Platz 28<br/>

        Represented by: Matthias Neid (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="274a4653534f4e4654674653425549485409485540">[email&#160;protected]</a>)

        <h2>Which data do we store and why?</h2>

        After we have clarified this, we can now talk about your data that we store: When you sign up you have to enter
        your username and your password or you link a Google account. If you connect a
        Google account, we save your account identifier and the email address of that account.
        You can also optionally add an email address while signing up or in your account settings.
        <br/><br/>
        Usually, your <strong>username</strong> cannot be traced back to you except if it contains your name or if you
        also use it on other platforms. Because of that, we protect your username the same way we protect personal data.
        <br/><br/>
        We only use your <strong>email address</strong> for notifications or to reset your password. You receive an email with a link to
        reset your password, which has to be requested manually on our website. We will never use your email address for
        a newsletter or anything like that. Notifications are emails with current information about your account or server, e.g.
        when your server is deleted for inactivity. You can disable those notifications in your account settings.
        <br/><br/>
        Your <strong>password</strong> is already concealed on your computer (hash) and will then be stored with more
        security (hash + salt) on our servers. So your password will never reach our servers in plaintext and is extra
        secured.
        <br/><br/>
        We also save the <strong>point in time</strong> of your registration to create statistics. Besides that, we have
        to keep that time to be able to prove that you have accepted this policy.
        <br/><br/>
        All <strong>settings</strong> of your Minecraft server and all <strong>files</strong> that are created by your
        Minecraft server are saved on our servers. Furthermore, we send this data as a backup to your Google Drive
        account if you want that and have it enabled.
        <br/><br/>
        Our <strong>storage system</strong> which stores the files of your Minecraft server logs all events (e.g. loading your files when
        starting the server or saving when stopping the server) together with your username or your user ID. Those events
        are saved for up to 7 days and help to identify and solve general or individual problems with our storage system.
        <br/><br/>
        Furthermore, we store how many and which <strong>players</strong> are currently on your Minecraft server to
        display them on the website in your account and to determine statistics on the total number of players.
        <br/><br/>
        Every time you <strong>start your server</strong> or a <strong>player joins</strong> your server, we collect this event
        together with the pseudonymised (hashed) user or player name. Those events are aggregated without personal
        data, and the individual events are deleted after 24 hours. This allows us to measure how many different servers
        are started and how many different players join every day.
        <br/><br/>
        Every <strong>request to our website</strong> is captured and stored for up to 24 hours. The URL, the IP address,
        the session ID, the Cloudflare Ray ID and the country code provided by Cloudflare are stored. This data is only used
        to analyse problems and especially to detect and defend against attacks.
        <br/><br/>
        Besides that, we never save your <strong>IP address</strong> for the long term when you use our website. But it is
        possible, that your Minecraft server writes your IP address and the IP addresses of other players into a log file. This
        log file is overwritten on every start and can always be deleted by reinstalling the server. You can always see your log
        file at <a href="https://aternos.org/log/" target="_blank">https://aternos.org/log/</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        To be able to understand what happened when errors or problems occur, we save <strong>miscellaneous
            activities</strong> on our website in a log file, e.g. when you start your server, who enters or leaves
        your server, when you up- or download a world or when you change your email address or password. This data will
        not be processed automatically. It will only be used manually to solve errors or to help you.
        <br/><br/>
        Some <strong>errors</strong> that can occur in our system, e.g. different errors related to transferring files or
        when starting your Minecraft server are stored together with your username for up to 24 hours to detect unusual peak
        occurrences of those errors, to analyse those errors and to solve them.
