        products, or services offered by MediaLab (collectively with Website,
        the “Services”). By accessing and using any of our Services, you are
        agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms
        of Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to our Services that link to or reference
        this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or
        applications maintained by third parties that we may link to or that may
        be accessible to you through our Services.
      </p>

      <h1><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h1>

        · Information we get from advertisers, third parties, and offline
        sources;

      <p>
        Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy
        are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services. If
        you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to provide
        you usage of the Services. Some of the data collection and uses are not
        strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related,
        and our basis for such collection and processing is for legitimate
        interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve the Services as
        explained in more detail below. If you want to know how to exercise your
        rights to manage or delete the personal information we may have about
        you, please review “YOUR CHOICES” below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Information You Provide Us When Using Our Services.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>Account Information</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> When you sign up to become a user of our Services,
        we collect personal information you choose to provide us, which may
        include your name, address, email, and phone number. We may also ask you
        for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age
        or gender that will be associated with your Services account. All of
        this information that may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is
        reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be
        linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household,
        or device is called “Personal Information”. Personal information does
        not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records;
        (b) De-identified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information
        excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act, such as: (i)
        health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance
        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California
        Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial
        data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific
        privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the
        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information
        Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>User Content</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> We collect the content, communications and other
        information you provide when you use our Services, including when you
        sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or
        communicate with others (collectively, “User Content”). For example, we
        review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat
        messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may collect
        the identity of the user and any users they communicate with. All posts
        of contents and replies are public and are publicly displayed (for
        information deleting content, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below). User
        Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users, us and others
        for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the rights and
        licenses in our <strong><u>Terms of Service</u></strong
        >). We collect information you choose to upload, sync or import from a
        device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which
        we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know.
        Please keep in mind that if you include information that could identify
        you in any content you share or post, people who see it may determine
        your identity. MediaLab does not post chat messages publicly but, as
        with any message that you send via any service, the recipient might do
        so.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>Your Purchase Transactions</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> If you make any purchases or engage in any other
        financial transactions through our Services, we collect information
        necessary to process the transaction. This includes payment information,
        such as your credit card or payment account information; authentication
        information; and billing, shipping and contact details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Information We Collect Automatically When Using Our Services.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>Location Information</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> Many features of the Services will not work unless
        you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent
        to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your
        mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect
        and use this information both while you are directly using the Services
        and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are not directly using
        the Services). For example, we or our advertising partners may show you
        content or posts from people around you or places you frequently visit,
        notifications of things happening around you in real time, or
        advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit
        your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location
        information is not available from your device for technical reasons, we
        may use your IP address or information about the WiFi SSID from which
        you access the Services to determine an approximate geographic location
        for your device. For more details about how you may control the
        collection of location information, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>Usage Information</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> We collect information about your use of the
        Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content
        interactions and other information about your interactions with our
        Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our
        Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong><u>Device Information</u></strong
        ><strong>.</strong> We collect information from and about the devices
        and browsers you use that integrate with our Services. For example, we
        collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating
        system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins, app
        and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available storage
        space, unique device identifiers and mobile network information (which
        is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we
        use only to identify your geographic area and to comply with applicable
        laws), information you give us access to through device settings such as
        photos, camera, or GPS location, identifiers associate with cookies, web
        beacons or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or
        browser. We may combine this information across different devices you
        use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our
        Services on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads)
        or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as
        your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in
        response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.

        whether or not you are logged in to a MediaLab Product at the time. We
        may combine such information with the information you have provided to
        us in order to provide and improve our Services. We require each of
        these advertisers, publishers, or other third parties to have lawful
        rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to
        us.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Any Other Information You Choose To Provide To Us.</strong></p>

        interact with the Services, apply for a job at our company, communicate
        with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or

        use collected information to verify accounts and activity, combat
        harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences,

        we collect from surveys or research, in addition to other collected
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong>Monitor and analyze trends and provide analytics.</strong> We
        use information to monitor and analyze trends and usage of our Services.

      </p>

      <h1><strong>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></h1>

      <p>
        We may share the information we have about you in the following ways:
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong>With Public or Others Using The Service.</strong> Any content,
        comments, or other communications posted to any of the Services is
        public and, as a result, can be seen by anyone, on or off our Services,
        including if they don’t have an account. This includes your username at
        the time the content was posted, the text and image contents of your
        post and the geographic location in which you posted your post or
        content. For some of our Services, a username will be randomly assigned
        to you that you may change or delete at any time. Your username is
        publicly displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you
        post information or content or send a chat message to another user.
        Please keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is
        the same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people
        who see it may determine your identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        o It is possible for public content to be accessed, downloaded, or
        shared through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, apps,
        websites, and by other services that integrate with our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        o When you use any chat messaging function to directly contact another
        user, the recipient of your chat message will see your username and the
        contents of your message. The recipient may also choose to disclose your
        chat messages to others.
      </p>

      <p>
        o If you post any User Content to the Services, other users may be able
        to see certain information related to your location. For example, other
        users may be able to see whether you are or were within a certain
        proximity of their current location or if you frequent similar
        locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        o If you invite others to try our Services via SMS, email or otherwise,
        those individuals may see your name, phone number, email address or
        other contact information.
      </p>

      <p>
        o For some of our Services, people can see signals telling them whether
        you are active on our Services, including whether you are currently
        active or when you last used our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong>With Social Sharing Services.</strong> The Services may offer
        social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share
        posts with other media. Your use of such features enables the sharing of
        information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings
        you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
        For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and
        processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the
        privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
      </p>

      <p>
        · <strong>With Advertisers.</strong> To perform analytics and deliver
        relevant content and advertising, we may allow others to collect
        information about how you use our Services. For example, these entities
        may use cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies to collect
        information about your computer or device, the content that interests
        you, the places you visit, and the time you spend using different parts
        of our Services.
      </p>

      <h1><strong>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS</strong></h1>

      <p>
        As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will
        contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example, when
        you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an
        advertiser's website to learn more about their products and services.
        Through these integrations, you will be providing information to an
        advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us. We are not
        responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect
        or use your information. As always, we encourage you to read the privacy
        policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or
        use.
      </p>

      <h1><strong>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h1>

      <p>
        How long we keep your information depends on the type of information,
        the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar
        factors. For example, we keep your information:
      </p>

      <p>
        · That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number,
        address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
      </p>

      <p>
        · For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to
        provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is
        required or permitted by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        · For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or
        enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is disabled
        for violation of our policies.
      </p>

      <p>
        · Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e.,
        not capable of identifying you).
      </p>

      <p>
        · In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of
        time or as required by applicable law.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete
        your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more). Keep in mind, while
        our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we
        cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific
        timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete
        your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we
        may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive
        valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we
        receive reports of abuse or other
        <strong><u>Terms of Service</u></strong> violations, or if your use of
        our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for
        abuse or other <strong><u>Terms of Service</u></strong> violations.
      </p>

      <h1><strong>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</strong></h1>

      <p>
        The security of your personal information is very important, and we take
        a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented
        technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help
        protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and
        modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
        safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your
        information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer
        necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for
        an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to
        consider appropriate new technologies and methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect,
        impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or
        guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure,
        nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed,
        disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These
        are the risks of being online and conducting business online.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify
        you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We
        may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.
        Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a
        notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about
        the security of your information, please contact us via our

      <h1><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></h1>

      <p>
        We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with
        the following tools to exercise control over the information we have
        about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal
        limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to us, we
        will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional
        information before we let you exercise your choices over the information
        we have about you. We may also reject your request for several reasons,
        including, by way of example only, if the request risks the privacy of
        other persons or is unlawful.

      <p>
        Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly, so
        long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may choose
        to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we will then
        remove them from the Services. However, it is important to note that
        your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for
        a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup
        reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of
        the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them.
        Search engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our
        Services. You may have to contact these third-party sites or search
        engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their
        policies and procedures.

        If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the

        As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain
        information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for
        the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and others. We may also

      <h2>· <strong>Opting Out Of Cookies And Other Technologies.</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you
        the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking
        technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can
        usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to
        prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all devices
        and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one
        browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may
        change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking
        technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have
        not opted out from displaying customized advertising. In addition,
        opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying
        advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and,
        consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make these
        choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an
        opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same
        Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This means
        that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the
        availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing
        your consent choices from being stored. As a result, we may not know
        about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out. We encourage you
        to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or
        browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies.
        For more information on how to disable cookies on the most common

        Under California law, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the
        right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time
        (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of
        consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we
        receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either
        the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the
        parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers
        who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at
        any time.
      </p>

        wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize
        personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt
        back in to personal information sales at any time by: Accessing
        ‘Personal Data Consent' in ‘Settings’ on applicable Product being used.
      </p>

      <p>
        You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out
        rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out
        request to review and comply with the request. You may also opt out of

        extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or
        whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us using our

      </p>

      <p>
        The legal bases for which we collect and use the information described
        above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The
        four bases upon which we rely include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contract</strong>. This means we need the information to
          perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data due to
          contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will
          result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services
          that require that data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>. This means we have a legitimate
          interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect
          and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider
          how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least
          obtrusive on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to
          protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and
          use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law
          enforcement; to make sure you are satisfied with how the services
          work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we
          collect and use information about how you and others use the services
          and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use
          information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry,
          information about how you access and use the services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Obligation</strong>. We may need to use your personal
          information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request,
          subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other
          users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong>. If we have no other legal basis for
          collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for
          a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent
          at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing
          conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting
        deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and
        UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information,
        including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Object or Restrict Processing. </strong>You have the
          right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information
          for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the
          legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate
          interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you
          can send us a request to delete your account by using our
          <a href="https://kikhelpcenter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"
            ><u>privacy contact form</u></a
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Access or Erasure. </strong>You have the right to
          have your personal data erased and no longer processed. You also have
          the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you. You
          can send us a request to delete your account or access your
          information by using our
          <a href="https://kikhelpcenter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"
            ><u>privacy contact form</u></a
          >. Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to
          delete your personal information from the Service and from our
          internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are
          not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law
          enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations,
          litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We
          may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Withdrawal of Consent.</strong> If we are processing your
          Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of
          collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent
          at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right,
          you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis
          for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data if such use
          or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of the
          Services. You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by using our
          <a href="https://kikhelpcenter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"
            ><u>privacy contact form</u></a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Portability. </strong>You can exercise your right to
          export your personal data by using our
          <a href="https://kikhelpcenter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"
            ><u>privacy contact form</u></a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>File a Complaint. </strong>You have the right to complain to
          the data protection authority located in your Member State. To find
          contact details, <u>click here</u>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As explained above, personal data collected in the EU or UK may be
        transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the EU and/or
        UK and processed by employees operating outside of the EU and/or UK who
        work for us, one of our business partners, or service providers. We have
        implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer
        of your personal data to the United States. We utilize standard contract
        clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about
        certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data
        transfers to the United States.
      </p>

      <h1><strong>CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</strong></h1>

      <p>
        The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that
        online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly
        collect personally identifiable information online from children who are
        under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable
        information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from
        anyone under the age of 16 in countries subject to the EU GDPR, unless
        exempted by individual country exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are under 13, or 16 where applicable, please do not attempt to
        register for the Services or send any personal information about
        yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information
        from a child under the required minimum age, we will delete that
        information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under
        the required minimum age may have provided us personal information,
        please contact us using our
        <a href="https://kikhelpcenter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"
          ><u>contact form</u></a
        >.

      <h1><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>

      <p>
        We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and
        at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a
        notice to our Services and will update the notice’s effective date. We
        will give you an opportunity to review the changes before they go into
        effect. Your continued use of the Services following notice of the
        changes constitutes your acceptance of the changes, so we encourage you
        to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use our services. If you do
        not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you may delete your account(s).
      </p>
