<h3 id="an-introduction-from-our-founder-and-ceo"><strong>An Introduction from our founder and CEO</strong></h3>
<p>Pierre Valade</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/Artboard-1.jpg" alt /></p>
<p><em>This policy was last updated on January 28, 2023.</em></p>
<p>As the CEO of Jumbo, I made a commitment to ensure that each decision we make for the product and our company fundamentally respects your security and privacy. As we enter our fourth year of operations, our commitment remains as strong as ever.</p>
<p>The following two principles guide how we think about privacy and security in our day-to-day decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we will never EVER sell your personal data: We’ve all seen countless free apps and services turn their user’s data into the product itself. We are doing things differently; we will never monetize through ads, or sell your data to be used in third-party marketing. Recently, we decided <a href="https://blog.withjumbo.com/jumbo-becomes-free-for-all-consumers.html">not to charge our users</a> for JUMBO so we could make the internet safer for everyone who needs our product. But JUMBO won’t be free, instead we plan to charge those visionary businesses and employers who see the growing threats against security and privacy online and want JUMBO to protect their team.</li>
<li>Second, minimize data collection: We believe the less data we store, the greater our security since a) we become unattractive to hackers, and b) we compromise little in the event that we get breached. We will prioritize building services where the collection or use of your personal data is as small as possible. For example, we don’t ask you to create a Jumbo account because we don’t need to know who you are to serve you. For some services, we don’t collect or use any personal data at all and any data that is collected is encrypted and never made publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for trusting us with your privacy and security. If you have any questions or comments, you can always reach out to us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="80f3f5f0f0eff2f4c0f7e9f4e8eaf5ede2efaee3efed">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>- Pierre Valade</p>
<h3 id="how-we-secure-your-data">How We Secure Your Data</h3>
<p>For the Jumbo App to function properly, it needs access to some of your data. However, most of this data does not ever need to leave your device’s local memory. The less data that leaves your device, the less chances it has to be hacked.</p>
<p>Based on the principle of minimizing data collection, the team here at Jumbo has designed the Jumbo App to keep any data it needs to function locally on your device as a default. The Jumbo App only ever sends a piece of data to the company’s server if truly necessary to provide a feature. See below for a list of data that we might transfer to and from your device.</p>
<p>This approach has several benefits beyond reducing the risk of a breach. There is no account for you to login to and thus no credentials that can be leaked. There is no need to externally verify your personal information. Also, 2FA is not needed since your device would have to be stolen and breached first before your Jumbo App is affected. In the event that any data does leave your device, it is always encrypted. Finally, you have complete control over the data stored locally on your device since it can be cleared forever if you delete the Jumbo app.</p>
<p>Jumbo does not provide features that allow for interactions between users beyond the functionality in our family feature.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our approach, please reach out to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="61121411110e131521160815090b140c030e4f020e0c">[email&#160;protected]</a>. We’re always happy to talk about it because we believe this is the way personal data should always be treated.</p>
<h3 id="information-collected-by-jumbo-tldr">Information Collected by Jumbo TL;DR</h3>
<p>At a high level, here is a list of what Jumbo does, and does not store. Check the full privacy policy below for specifics.</p>
<p>Jumbo never collects or stores the following because it has nothing to do with the service we provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biometric data</li>
<li>Health data</li>
<li>Message data</li>
<li>Geolocation* data</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumbo stores the following locally on your device (You can clear this forever anytime by deleting the app):</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords</li>
<li>Usernames</li>
<li>Social media posts that you ask Jumbo to auto-archive
<ul>
<li>Note: These posts are your data and you can choose to delete or retain them. If you wish to delete that data, you simply need to delete the Jumbo app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumbo stores the following on our server in order to provide specific services:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hashed version of your email addresses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">see here</a> for more information on hashing)</li>
<li>An encrypted version of your email address for your insurance certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>*Jumbo may ask for access to your approximate location to provide a localized user experience. This data is only processed temporarily, and does not get transmitted to Jumbo servers nor is it stored locally on your device.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-policy---full">Privacy Policy - Full</h3>
<p>Thank you for using Jumbo! This privacy policy describes how 2121 Atelier, Inc. d.b.a. Jumbo Privacy (“Jumbo” or “we”) and our product (“Jumbo App”) collects and processes your personal data, in compliance with applicable laws protecting your privacy, when you use Jumbo’s privacy and security services.</p>
<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>

<p><strong>Store</strong>: To keep on company servers or similar data storage facilities for future use.</p>

<p><strong>The Company (“We” or “Us” or “Jumbo Privacy”)</strong>: The team that builds the Jumbo App including its engineers, customer support agents, etc.</p>
<h3 id="title-1--jumbo-features-you-may-use"><strong>Title 1 – Jumbo Features You May Use</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Section 1. Privacy &amp; Security Services in the Jumbo App</strong></p>
<p>Jumbo App is a mobile application available on iOS and Android that helps you protect your online privacy and security by giving you control over privacy settings, notifying you of data breaches, checking the security of your Wi-Fi, blocking trackers and much more.</p>
<p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. It is not specifically intended for student or educational purposes, though our hope is that using the App will teach you about best privacy and security practices. If Jumbo Privacy learns that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, Jumbo Privacy will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or legal guardian, you can ask us to delete inadvertently collected Personal Information or Persistent Identifiers. We will also delete the data of any user if requested. To make such a request, please email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="22515752524d505662554b564a48574f404d0c414d4f">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Before processing your request, we may need a log from the device whose data you are requesting the deletion for.</p>
<p>Before using the Jumbo App, please ensure that you have read and understood how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information as described in the parts of this Privacy Policy that is relevant to you.</p>
<p><strong>A. Functionalities</strong></p>
<p>The Jumbo App will never change anything in your accounts without your prior authorization. Consequently, we only process your data because you have consented to it and/or because we are performing a service you have requested from us.</p>
<p><strong>(i) Change of the privacy settings of your online accounts</strong></p>
<p>The Jumbo App offers you the ability to scan the privacy settings on some of your online accounts and suggests changes to maximize your privacy. You can choose which of your online accounts you want the App to scan.</p>
<p>To provide this service, you are asked to log into your account(s) through the Jumbo App. Your account authentication details, i.e., username and password, remain stored locally in your device during the whole process. We do not copy or store any of this personal data in Jumbo Privacy’s servers.</p>
<p>In no event will your password be transmitted to Jumbo Privacy’s servers. If you do not wish for your password to be stored locally within the Jumbo App in your device, please do not use this feature. To delete your passwords, simply disconnect your account from the Jumbo App.</p>
<p><strong><em>(ii) Transfer and storage of your personal content</em></strong></p>
<p>If you decide to transfer some of your personal content (e.g. when archiving posts from Facebook) in the App, this transfer is made directly from your account to the storage space you have selected, which may be the App or a third-party storage space that you select.</p>
<p>If you decide to store your personal content in the Jumbo App, your personal content will remain stored locally in your device and it is not copied or stored in Jumbo Privacy’s servers. In no event will this personal content that you choose to transfer be transmitted to Jumbo Privacy’s servers.</p>
<p>If you want to delete your personal content, you can do so by deleting the Jumbo App.</p>
<p>If you decide to transfer your personal content directly to a third-party storage service, please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review and that you will be subject to. This means that we are not responsible for how your data is stored or subsequently processed with them.</p>
<p><strong><em>(iii) Contact information and address book for email-based functions</em></strong></p>
<p>The Jumbo App offers you the ability to perform certain functions on email addresses and accounts, such as a data breach dark web scan. To perform these functions, you may be asked to give the Jumbo App access to your address book or provide an email address. The App will transmit these email addresses to Jumbo Privacy’s servers in order to allow us to execute the scan. You are solely responsible for any email addresses that you provide to us and obtaining consent for transmitting this data as appropriate.</p>
<p>We do not store any information from your address book for the purpose of referrals.</p>
<p><strong>B. Your rights</strong></p>
<p><em>How to access, rectify, or delete your personal data</em></p>
<p>You can access, rectify, or delete the accounts you have managed through the Jumbo App and/or the data you have stored within the Jumbo App at any time directly in the Jumbo App.</p>
<p>To delete any data stored in the Jumbo App, simply delete the Jumbo App from your phone. To delete data stored by Jumbo Privacy on our servers, please send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="55262025253a272115223c213d3f2038373a7b363a38">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2. Jumbo App Analytics</strong></p>
<p>The Jumbo App collects anonymous analytics information to allow us to ensure that our product works correctly on different devices and operating systems, and to improve the quality of our product and make your experience better. We use aggregate, non-personal data like device-type, the operating system version and any error logs. These analytics are only used to improve the Jumbo App and are never shared with third-parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You can opt-out from these anonymous Jumbo App analytics at any time, directly from the Jumbo App via settings by toggling OFF the ‘Crash Reporting &amp; Analytics’ setting. If you do this, we will no longer collect analytic data from your device.</p>
<p>The Jumbo App sends your anonymous analytics data to our analytics provider: Amplitude. To the extent that you do not opt-out of this collection as detailed above, you consent to this transfer of data by us to Amplitude. For more information about Amplitude’s privacy practices, please see <a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy">here</a>. If you would like to delete your anonymous analytics history at any time, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1f6c6a6f6f706d6b5f68766b77756a727d70317c7072">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3. Push Notifications</strong></p>
<p>If you have given us your prior approval to do so, we may send you updates about the Jumbo App and/or the company by sending you push notifications through the Jumbo App.</p>
<p>To send you push notifications, we store and use a token generated by Apple or Google which is unique to your use of the Jumbo App on your phone. At no point could this token be used by the company or its sub-processors to identify a user or reveal their personal data such as their location. These tokens are stored with our database provider, MongoDB.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving these notifications at any time by toggling Jumbo’s notification permissions in your phone’s operating system settings. For more information about MongoDB’s privacy practices, please see <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4. Support</strong></p>
<p>Jumbo Privacy is by your side to help you control your security and privacy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Jumbo App, this Privacy Policy or your privacy rights, you can contact our support team directly in the Jumbo App, or by sending an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="34474144445b464074435d405c5e4159565b1a575b59">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>Jumbo’s Support team uses Help Scout as a service provider to receive and reply to your email queries, and service provider Front when you chat with us directly in the Jumbo App. When you contact us through email or chat, the privacy policies of these third-party services will apply to you and your data. For more information about Help Scout, please see <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/privacy/">here</a>. For more information about Front, please see <a href="https://front.com/legal/privacy-notice">here</a>.</p>
<p>Conversations with Jumbo’s Support team are automatically purged from Help Scout and Front after 180 days.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5. Surveys</strong></p>
<p>We sometimes conduct surveys within the Jumbo App to gather feedback on our products and services. When conducting such surveys, we might collect anonymous information such as country or age range to understand demographics of our user base, and you consent to this collection when you choose to participate in a user survey. We use service provider Typeform for conducting these surveys and their privacy policies will apply when you use their platform. For more information about Typeform’s privacy practices, see <a href="https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029581691-What-happens-to-my-data-">here</a>).</p>
<p>We do not ever sell or transfer this survey data to any third party as it is purely used to get feedback and insights on how Jumbo can better serve our users.</p>
<p>You can opt-out from any further communication about user surveys, and rectify or erase your email address used in any received communication about these surveys by sending us an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfcccacfcfd0cdcbffc8d6cbd7d5cad2ddd091dcd0d2">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6. Newsletter</strong></p>
<p>The company has previously provided a periodic newsletter to its users and may provide one in the future. If available, you will be able to subscribe by giving us your email address in the Jumbo App or on our dedicated websites. We only send the newsletter to you for the informational purposes you have chosen when you subscribed.</p>
<p>You can opt-out whenever you want by clicking the opt-out link directly in the newsletter or by sending us an email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fb888e8b8b94898fbb8c928f93918e969994d5989496">[email&#160;protected]</a>. We will then stop sending you our newsletter, and will delete your email address from our emailing list. We use service provider Mailchimp to send you our newsletter and your use will be subject to their privacy policies if you choose to subscribe. For more information, please see <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Section 7. Functioning cookies on our websites</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies on our websites available at the following URL addresses: <a href="https://blog.withjumbo.com" title="https://blog.withjumbo.com">https://blog.withjumbo.com</a> and <a href="https://www.withjumbo.com/">withjumbo.com</a> strictly for necessary purposes to enable our websites to work properly.

<p>We do not have any other cookies on our websites (such as tracking or advertising cookies).</p>
<p>You can refuse the use of cookies at any time by adjusting the settings of your browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome) by selecting the “cookies” option in the “Help” function to obtain information about the location of the cookie folder.

<h3 id="title-2-sub-processors"><strong>TITLE 2: Sub-Processors</strong></h3>
<p>Sub-processors are third-party data processors that are engaged by Jumbo Privacy to enable the functionality of the App and who may have access to your data. We only share your personal data with sub-processors we rely on if strictly necessary to provide you with our privacy and security services.</p>
<p>Where we need to share your personal data with sub-processors, we have chosen them with a lot of care to make sure they take privacy as seriously as we do and that they only use your personal data for the purposes we have instructed them to do. Where applicable, we also execute data processing agreements with sub-processors to regulate how such service providers use your personal data. You should be aware that these sub-processors maintain their own privacy policies and practices, and that these will apply to the data that we provide to them.</p>
<p>In some instances, for example in the cases of Amplitude and Typeform, the data we share with sub-processors can be used for research or product improvement. In the case of Amplitude, an analytics platform, we use anonymous analytic data – such as whether a given user’s phone is iOS or Android, what version of iOS/Android is on the phone, the device’s language settings, as well as which Jumbo features are activated, if a feature has crashed, etc. – to improve Jumbo’s service and reliability. In the case of Typeform, a survey tool, we send voluntary surveys to Jumbo users to help us understand their needs better – such as why a survey participant likes a feature, what they want Jumbo to build for them next, etc.. Please see the respective paragraphs below for specifics on each sub-processor.</p>
<p>##</p>
<p><strong>Section 1. Help Scout</strong></p>
<p><em>Helpdesk</em></p>
<p>We have decided to use Help Scout as our helpdesk service provider. Therefore, if you email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8dfef8fdfde2fff9cdfae4f9e5e7f8e0efe2a3eee2e0">[email&#160;protected]</a>, Help Scout will receive and keep a copy of your IP address, and your name if it is sent as part of the headers of the email protocol. We have set up Help Scout to automatically delete all emails from their servers 180 days after they are received.</p>
<p>For more information about how Help Scout processes your data, please visit <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/privacy/" title="https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/privacy/">https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>
<p>You can also consult the data processing agreement signed with Help Scout, available here: <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/dpa/" title="https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/dpa/">https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/dpa/</a></p>
<p><strong>Section 2. Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>Our email servers (that we are using for <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7a090f0a0a15080e3a0d130e12100f17181554191517">[email&#160;protected]</a> for example) are powered by Microsoft Cloud. If you email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ef9c9a9f9f809d9baf98869b87859a828d80c18c8082">[email&#160;protected]</a>, Microsoft servers will receive and keep a copy of your IP address, and your name if your name is sent as part of the headers of the email protocol. Contrary to what we have set up for Help Scout, we will keep your emails for as long as it is necessary for replying to your request and then for as long as necessary, if required to, for documentation purposes (generally from two to five years, depending on your jurisdiction and the type of emails you have sent to Jumbo Privacy).</p>
<p>For example, emails containing details of your Privacy Requests and your signed mandate will be kept for two years for proof purposes. For more information about how Microsoft processes your data, please visit <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/" title="https://privacy.microsoft.com/">https://privacy.microsoft.com/</a>.

<p><strong>Section 7. SpyCloud</strong></p>
<p>To verify if your email address was involved in a data breach, we transmit a hash of your email to a third-party provider: Spycloud.

<p>SpyCloud uses this unique hash to verify, without knowing who you are, if your email address (i.e. the hash email) has been compromised in a data breach.</p>
<p>We have signed a specific data protection agreement with SpyCloud to supervise their use of your hashed email. Please contact us for more information.</p>
