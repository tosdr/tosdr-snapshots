<p><strong>3. Specificities of some Services offered in Jumbo App</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 Transferring Your Content to Third-Party Storing Services</strong></p>
<p>We believe that it is important for You to decide where You want to keep Your Content stored, therefore the Jumbo App and Services allow You to transfer Your Content to third-party Storage Services that We have selected based on what We believe are the most common third-party Storage Services used by You. We have no affiliation nor partnership with such Storage Services, nor do We control them.</p>
<p>Therefore, We do not monitor nor endorse the terms of use nor the privacy statements of such Storage Services and bear no responsibility for the provision of these Storage Services. We encourage You to review the terms of use and privacy statements of the Storage Services before You choose to transfer them Your Content, so that You can understand how those Storage Services will store, use and/or share Your Content.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. Privacy Management</strong></p>
<p>Jumbo allows You to manage Your privacy settings within Your Accounts by showing You how Your information is used by the Account You select, by following this process :</p>
<ul>
<li>When You choose an Account to inspect, Jumbo Privacy will respond to Your request and review the use of Your data by the selected Account.</li>
<li>Jumbo Privacy then tells You what data is processed by Your Account, where You can find this data and then offers to delete the data You no longer wish to have processed in Your Account.</li>
<li>These are simple suggestions made following Your request to inspect the data processed in Your Account.</li>
<li>Jumbo App’s proposals are based on what is technically possible to do but no guarantee is given as to the practical application of these requests on Your Account.</li>
<li>You are under no obligation to follow these suggestions, You can either simply read the result of the research or do nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not responsible for :</p>
<ul>
<li>the consequences of Your choices on the Jumbo App, including the actions taken on Your Account as a result of Your choices, for which You are solely responsible for,</li>
<li>the impact of Your choices made in Your Account. You agree that you bear full responsibility to ensure that the data is no longer processed in accordance with the choices you have made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumbo App does not interfere with the privacy settings available within Your Accounts, nor does it offer additional privacy settings.</p>
<p>We encourage You to review the terms of use and privacy statements of Your accounts to understand what is done with Your personal data in Your accounts.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Block trackers</strong></p>
<p>If You enable the “Block Tracker” Feature in the Jumbo App, the application will block connections to servers you have selected by enabling an extension that will appear as a “VPN” on your phone. Please note that contrary to a VPN, this extension does not encrypt traffic made on your phone. You can turn this feature off at any time directly in the Jumbo App or through the iOS or Android device settings.</p>
<p>You are the one responsible to choose which trackers you want to block at any time by selecting or deselecting a tracker in your Jumbo App.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Jumbo Privacy has relied on third-party lists available online from privacy experts’ blogs to decide what trackers to enable you to block or not (notably the list <a href="https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/">available here</a>). Jumbo Privacy provides no warranty on whether such trackers are effectively tracking your data, whether such trackers are misusing your data, and whether you should or not disable them by using the “Block Tracker” feature.</p>
<p>When using this feature, you acknowledge and agree that the process used to block these trackers cannot determine the origin of a connection attempt and as such may occasionally block content you were trying to access. This is an unwanted side effect of this feature and cannot be completely avoided.</p>
<p><strong>3.4. Identity Theft insurance</strong></p>
<p>Depending on factors such as location, local laws or regulations and our partner’s terms and conditions, we might offer certain subscribers the opportunity to activate an Identity Theft insurance. The Identity Theft Insurance is managed solely by our third-party partner, Identity Force, a Sontiq brand.</p>
<p>The description of the Identity Theft insurance in the Jumbo App is a summary, and intended for informational purposes only. It does not include all terms, conditions and exclusions of the described insurance policy. Please refer to the actual policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions of coverage available here (<a href="https://www.identityforce.com/terms-of-use">Identity Force Terms</a>).</p>
<p><strong>4. Using Jumbo App - Your commitments</strong></p>
