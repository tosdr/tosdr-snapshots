<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Learning Site Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the types of personal information (“PI”) that Wayside Publishing (“Company,” “we” or “our”) may collect or receive from you or about you when you visit or use the Learning Site website and Software-as-a-Service application accessible at <a href="https://learningsite.waysidepublishing.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://learningsite.waysidepublishing.com</a> (the “Service”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By visiting, accessing, or using or downloading content from the Service, you agree to our collection and use of personal information as this Policy describes. <u>This Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Service after any modification means that you acknowledge the change and agree to the practices that we disclose in the Policy.&nbsp;</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>This Policy applies to the Service only. This Policy does not apply to</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square; margin-left:40px">
	<li>
	<p><span class="marker">the Wayside Publishing corporate website, <a href="http://www.waysidepublishing.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">www.waysidepublishing.com</a>;&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="marker">third-party platforms and products with which we partner from time to time; or&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="marker">personal information that we collect or receive offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Wayside Publishing or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries).&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>Relationship Between this Policy and Other Agreements, Policies and Disclosures&nbsp;</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you use the Service in connection with a school or school district that is a customer of Wayside Publishing (a “Customer”), then written agreements between Wayside Publishing and you and/or that Customer may conflict with this Policy. For example, a written agreement between Wayside Publishing and either you or the Customer may provide you with rights not described in this Policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also maintain and publish other written policies, notices and disclosures about privacy and data protection (“Supplemental Policies”) that may apply to you as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To the extent that any written agreement or written policy, notice or disclosure about privacy or data protection conflicts with any provision of this Policy, the provision that provides you the more favorable rights will apply to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>PI That You Manually Provide Us&nbsp;</u></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
