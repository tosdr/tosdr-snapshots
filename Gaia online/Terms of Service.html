        <strong>Monitoring/Member reporting</strong>.  Gaia has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any and all activity on Gaia Online.  Gaia also has the right, but not the obligation to investigate fully reports from Members and Monitors of improper conduct.  Gaia may remove any Member Submission or terminate any Member account and/or ban any Member at any time for any action in violation of these Terms including, for conduct detrimental to other Members or Gaia, or for any other reason that in Gaia’s sole discretion warrants such termination.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Eligibility; Account Information</strong>. Gaia Online is not available to persons under the age of 13.  You agree that the date of birth and all other information you provide to Gaia during Member registration and, at all other times, will be true, accurate, current and complete. You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. Gaia may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer Gaia Online to any person or entity. Gaia may change its eligibility criteria at any time. Any Members previously suspended or removed from Gaia Online by Gaia may not be permitted to re-join.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gold/Platinum, Virtual Currency</strong>. Throughout your Gaia Online experience, you may accumulate &quot;Gold/Platinum&quot;, which constitutes a limited license right to use a feature of Gaia Online when, as, and if allowed by Gaia. Gold/Platinum is the fictional currency used in the world of Gaia Online and it may only be used to purchase virtual goods or virtual services which are stored in the Member's inventory and can be used to enhance the look of the Member's on-line persona or player, also known as an &quot;Avatar&quot;, or other on-site features. Gaia may charge fees for the right to use Gold/Platinum, or may distribute Gold/Platinum without charge, in its sole discretion. Regardless of terminology used, Gold/Platinum represents a limited license right governed solely under these Terms, has no real value, and is not transferable or redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Gaia at any time. As a condition of using Gaia Online and accumulating Gold/Platinum, you agree that Gaia has the absolute right to reduce, manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Gold/Platinum, including the Gold/Platinum in your inventory, as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and that Gaia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such rights. Upon your closing of your account or the termination of your account by Gaia as provided in these terms, you understand that your limited license to use Gold/Platinum will be terminated and that no sum shall be due and owing to you for the Gold/Platinum accumulated in your inventory or account.  Notwithstanding any other language to the contrary, as used in these Terms and throughout Gaia Online in the context of Gold/Platinum transfers: (a) the term &quot;sell&quot; means &quot;to transfer for consideration to another Member or Gaia the licensed right to use Gold/Platinum in accordance with these Terms&quot; and (b) the term &quot;buy&quot; means &quot;to receive for consideration from another Member or Gaia the licensed right to use Gold/Platinum in accordance with these Terms&quot;. Gaia may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Gold/Platinum transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of these Terms or other laws or regulations, to conform with revisions to these Terms, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with Gaia Online, such as creating multiple secondary accounts strictly to accumulate Gold/Platinum by using site features and then funneling it to a singular account.

All items, Gaia Gold/Platinum, Gaia Cash, and other aspects of your account are considered to be a limited license to you for your use while your account is in open.  Due to the limited nature of the license, the inventory in your account, your Member Submissions and any other virtual items (including Gaia Gold/Platinum and Gaia Cash), creations or submissions are considered to be forfeit when you close your account, when the account is banned for violation of the Terms or otherwise terminated as provided herein or in the event that Gaia discontinues the Site. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.</strong> Gaia may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing access to Gaia Online, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to Gaia Online or any account you may have or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that Gaia shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. As discussed herein, Gaia does not permit copyright infringing activities on Gaia Online, and reserves the right to terminate access to Gaia Online, and remove all content submitted, by any Members who are found to be infringers. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity or any of the other prohibited conduct as set forth herein shall be grounds for immediate termination of your use of Gaia Online and, in certain circumstances, referral to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
