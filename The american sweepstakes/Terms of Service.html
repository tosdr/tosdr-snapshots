<p>You and we each agree that any and all disputes or claims with or against any party that relate to or arise from your use of or access to the Website, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Website shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate section (this “Agreement to Arbitrate”).</p>
<h2>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</h2>
<p>You and we agree that each of us may bring claims that relate to or arise from your use of or access to the Website, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Website only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq. or the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 630 et seq. Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a consolidated, class, or representative proceeding or otherwise consolidate or join claims from more than one person or party. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief, including monetary, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking such relief and only to such extent as may be necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s). No relief awarded shall affect our other users.
</p>
<h2>Arbitration Procedures</h2>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.
</p>
<p>
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> http://www.adr.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
The arbitration shall be held in the county of your residence or at another location mutually agreed by both parties. If the value of the relief sought is less than or equal to $10,000, either party may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions and such election shall be binding on both parties subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to necessitate an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Unless the arbitrator requires otherwise, either party may attend an in-person hearing by telephone.
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator shall determine the substance of all claims in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Missouri, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed or entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof.
</p>
<p>
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate and the closing of your account (if applicable) or your use of or access to the Website, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Website.
</p>
<h2>Costs of Arbitration</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate, all payments related to filing, administration and arbitrator fees (Arbitration Costs) will be governed by the AAA’s rules Where the value of the relief sought is less than or equal to $10,000 the Company may, at your request, pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees related to the arbitration. We will make arrangements to pay the Arbitration Costs to AAA only for those requests that are submitted, along with demand for arbitration, by mail to the AAA. Where the value of the relief sought is over $10,000 and you are successful in demonstrating that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of Arbitration Costs as may be deemed necessary by the arbitrator to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If the arbitrator determines your claim(s) in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree that you will be liable to reimburse us for all the Arbitration Costs paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be required to pay under the AAA’s rules.
</p>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, vacate or enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties’ respective attorneys, tax advisors, and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.</p>
<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>Except for the “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” provision of this Agreement to Arbitrate, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall remain in full force and effect. Where an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provision(s) in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (i.e. “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.
