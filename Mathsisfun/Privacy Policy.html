      <h2>Information Collection and Use </h2>
            <p>Mathsisfun.com is the sole owner of the information collected on 
              this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to

<h2>Cookies </h2>
            <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer containing 
              information about the user's visit. Usage of a cookie is in no way 
              linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 
              For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the site can know if you pressed &quot;hide ads&quot;. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our 
              site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
              in some areas of our site. </p>
            <h2>Advertisers</h2>
            <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. </p>
            <h2>Log Files</h2>
            <p>We use IP addresses to analyze 
              trends, administer the site, track movement, and gather broad 
              demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
              linked to personally identifiable information. We may 
              share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
              This is not linked to any personal information that can identify 
              any individual person. </p>
            <h2> Links to Other Sites </h2>
      <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
              mathsisfun.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
              other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave 
              our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web 
              site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy 
              statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
      <h2>Security </h2>
            <p>Mathsisfun.com is a free information-only service and sells 
              no products directly. At no 
              time will mathsisfun.com directly request address or payment details. 
              However, some partner sites do sell direct.  Please 
              check as mathsisfun.com cannot be responsible for insecure transactions 
              from other web sites. </p>
            <h2> Notification of Changes </h2>
            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users
              on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information 
              we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose 
              it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy 
              under which the information was collected.            </p>
