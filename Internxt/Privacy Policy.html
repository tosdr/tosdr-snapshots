Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p><p class="mb-6">This Agreement and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.

Users acting as Storage Nodes acknowledge that they must comply with EU GDPR Privacy Law. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Internxt, and Internxt has no responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations. In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“Account”). In connection with your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate, current and complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary, (iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage Services that you use for third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that if you lose your password, you may be unable to recover any Storage Materials. One same person cannot hold various free Internxt accounts.

You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials.</p><p class="mb-6">(c) Users with a free account who do not log in to their account for a period of one year will be considered inactive. Users will receive an email notice 7 days prior to reaching inactive status. Once a free account reaches that status, its files will be removed from the network in order to free up space for those free users who are actively using their account.</p><p class="mb-6">(d) Accounts on any of our premium plans who fail to renew their plan within a period of 7 days will be terminated.</p><p class="mb-6">(e) All users who buy any of Internxt&#x27;s premium plans will be eligible for a 30 day refund, unless they already receive a 30 day trial period of any of Internxt&#x27;s premium plan.

We will terminate any free accounts that have no activity for one year (this includes any account that has not uploaded, downloaded, shared or modified a file in a period of one year). We will also terminate accounts under any of our paid plans, that fail to renew their plan after 7 days from the payment renewal deadline.

This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions. None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you&#x27;re sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy. Here&#x27;s a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer. IP Address: This is your computer&#x27;s address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes&#x27; messages can reach your computer. IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection&#x27;s bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It&#x27;s a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store. If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we suggest you do not run Internxt&#x27;s Core program.</p><p class="mb-6">We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf in connection with our Services.

Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions. None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you&#x27;re sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy. Here&#x27;s a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer. IP Address: This is your computer&#x27;s address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes&#x27; messages can reach your computer. IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection&#x27;s bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It&#x27;s a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store. If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we suggest you do not run Internxt&#x27;s Core program.</p><p class="mb-6">We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf in connection with our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and apps, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, app performance, time spent on pages and links clicked.

We calculate availability based upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.","subtitle212":"(b) Our SLA obligations do not extend to any unavailability of the Storage Services that is caused by: (i) any hardware or software that you use in connection with the Storage Services; (ii) misuse of our Storage Services or the Storage Platform, including use in breach of the Agreement or use other than in accordance with any documentation or ther instructions provided by Internxt; (iii) circumstances or events beyond the reasonable control of Internxt; or (iv) our suspension or termination of your access to the Storage Services pursuant to the rights we have reserved under the Agreement.","title22":"Storage Platform","subtitle22":"The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“Storage Materials”) via a distributed network of third-party devices (“Storage Nodes”) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that independently operate open-source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. Users acting as Storage Nodes acknowledge that they must comply with EU GDPR Privacy Law. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Internxt, and Internxt has no responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations. In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“Account”).

You acknowledge and agree that if you lose your password, you may be unable to recover any Storage Materials. One same person cannot hold various free Internxt accounts. Internxt reserves the right to modify the features or storage capacity of its free plans at any time without any prior warning.","title23":"Storage Materials","subtitle23":"(a) Internxt will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible for backing up any Storage Materials.","subtitle232":"(b) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice, to remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement (including Internxt Terms of Use relating to User Content).","subtitle233":"(c) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data. You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security protections, including any (i) “protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA, (ii) “cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS, or (iii) “Sensitive Personal Data” as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.","title24":"Payment","subtitle24":"(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services ('Fees').

You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month’s usage. You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials.","subtitle243":"(c) Users with a free account who do not log in to their account for a period of one year will be considered inactive. Users will receive an email notice 7 days prior to reaching inactive status. Once a free account reaches that status, its files will be removed from the network in order to free up space for those free users who are actively using their account.","subtitle244":"(d) Accounts on any of our premium plans who fail to renew their plan within a period of 7 days will be terminated.","subtitle245":"(e) All users who buy any of Internxt's premium plans will be eligible for a 30 day refund, unless they already receive a 30 day trial period of any of Internxt's premium plan. After those first 30 days using any of our premium plans have passed, no refund will be applicable. To request a refund, you should reach out to us via email, at hello@internxt.com.","subtitle246":"(f) Storage Nodes agree to let Internxt generate invoices on their behalf, so that both parties can legally justify the payment Internxt sends to Storage Nodes every month.

We will terminate any free accounts that have no activity for one year (this includes any account that has not uploaded, downloaded, shared or modified a file in a period of one year). We will also terminate accounts under any of our paid plans, that fail to renew their plan after 7 days from the payment renewal deadline. Appropriate notice will be given to the user to try to avoid account termination.","title26":"Miscellaneous","subtitle26":"The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Internxt relating to your access to and use of our Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under the Agreement. The failure of Internxt to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control.

We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you're sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy.

IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection's bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It's a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store.
