          <h1>Disconnect terms of use</h1>
          <p>
            Thank you for using Disconnect. These terms of use — referred to as
            “Terms” — apply to your use of Disconnect’s software and services (including the apps Disconnect, Disconnect Premium, Privacy Pro, Do Not Track, and Privacy DNS) —
            referred to as “Services”. Your use of the Services indicates you
            agree to the Terms, so please read carefully. Please note, use of Disconnect’s Cloud Privacy Plus enterprise product is governed by the End User Agreement located <a href="https://disconnect.me/enterprise/eula">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Software license and updates</h2>
          <p>
            Access to some of our Services requires you to download a software
            package — referred to as “Software”. The Software is licensed to you
            and not sold, subject to the terms of this agreement. We grant you a
            nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software
            solely for your personal purposes. This license enters into force
            through your installation or use of the Software in accordance with
            the Terms. All rights and licenses not expressly granted to you
            under this agreement are retained by Disconnect. We may update the
            Software on your device automatically to provide new features and
            security upgrades.
          </p>
          <h2>Open-source code</h2>
          <p>
            Some of our code is available under open-source licenses that
            constitute separate written agreements.
            There may be provisions in the open-source licenses that expressly
            override these terms.
          </p>
          <h2>Protected property</h2>
          <p>
            The software and other technology we use to provide the Services are
            protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United
            States and foreign countries. These terms don’t give you the right
            to use the Disconnect logos, trademarks, domain names, or other
            brand features.
          </p>
          <h2>Restrictions</h2>
          <p>
            You agree that you won’t attempt to or in fact do the following to
            the Services: probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system
            or network; breach or otherwise circumvent any security or
            authentication measures; access, tamper with, or use non-public
            areas of the Services, areas of the Services you haven’t been
            invited to including Disconnect’s or our service providers’ computer
            systems; or commercialize, reproduce, modify, translate, create any
            derivative works, circumvent, disable, decompile, disassemble,
            reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for
            the Services (our open-source code is subject to separate licenses).
          </p>
          <h2>Responsibility for content</h2>
          <p>
            All content submitted to or available through the Services is the
            sole responsibility of the person who submitted the content. By
            submitting, posting, or displaying content as part of the Services,
            you give Disconnect the right to use such content. Disconnect
            doesn’t control, monitor, or have any detailed knowledge of the
            content. Therefore, you may be exposed to info that’s incorrect,
            offensive, or otherwise objectionable. Disconnect shall not be
            liable for the content and other info spread or delivered through
            or in connection with the Services. You agree that you shall bear
            all risks associated with the use of such info. We have no
            responsibility to remove content you make public — for example,
            comments you make on our blog or forum — so please be careful with
            what you post.
          </p>
          <h2>Linked sites and services</h2>
          <p>
            We choose our third-party providers and payment processors carefully but we’re not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Services, nor their information or content. When you use a link to go from the Services to another website, your browsing and interaction is subject to that website's own rules and policies, not ours. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
          </p>
          <h2>Support</h2>
          <p>
            We do our best to provide a great service, but we have no obligation
            to provide support or maintenance for the Services under this
            agreement. However, we may, at our sole discretion, provide limited
            technical support, upgrades, and updates.
          </p>
          <h2>Termination and refunds</h2>
          <p>
            You may terminate this agreement at any time by ceasing to
            participate in or access the Services. We may terminate this
            agreement and your use at any time, without cause and without
            notice. This agreement will automatically terminate if you fail to
            comply with the Terms. Upon any termination, you agree to uninstall
            and stop using the Services. Please note that if you purchase Disconnect 
            Services through a third-party, like the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, 
            or StackCommerce platform, terminations and refunds are subject to their 
            respective policies.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h2>No warranty</h2>
          <p>(The next paragraph is capitalized because of its importance.)</p>
          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCONNECT MAKES NO WARRANTY
            OR REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, THEIR QUALITY,
            PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
            AS A RESULT, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND YOU’RE ASSUMING
            THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THEIR QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand and acknowledge that Disconnect won’t be liable for
            problems attributable to the operation of the Services. Some states
            don’t allow these types of limiting terms.
          </p>
          <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>(Again with the capitalization.)</p>
          <p>
            YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT DISCONNECT SHALL, IN NO EVENT, BE LIABLE
            FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
            EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
            PROFITS AND GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
            SERVICES, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Your
            only right or remedy with respect to any problems or dissatisfaction
            with the Services is to uninstall and stop using the Services. In
            any event, direct damages are limited to the greater of (a) the
            amount paid for the Services or (b) $100.
          </p>
          <h2>Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any of, or portions thereof, the Terms are invalid or
            unenforceable, the court shall reform the Terms to include an
            enforceable term as close to the intent of the original term as
            possible. All other terms shall remain unchanged.
          </p>
          <h2>Waiver</h2>
          <p>
            The waiver or failure of Disconnect to exercise any right provided
            for in the Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of any further or
            future right under the Terms.
          </p>
          <h2>Governing law and dispute resolution</h2>
          <p>
            The Terms and any dispute arising from your use of the Services
            shall be governed by and construed in accordance with US federal law
            and the laws of the state of California. All disputes relating to
            the Terms shall be settled in the California State Court, County of
            Santa Clara or in the US Federal Court, Northern District of
            California. You and Disconnect agree to submit to the jurisdiction
            of and agree that venue is proper in these courts in any such legal
            action or proceeding.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may make small, inconsequential changes to the Terms with or
            without notice to you, so you’re encouraged to review the Terms from
            time to time. Changes we consider significant will be emailed to
            users who subscribe to the Disconnect newsletter or to those who
            submit a request to
            <a href="mailto:support@disconnect.me">support@disconnect.me</a>. By
            continuing to use the Services after revisions become effective, you
            are agreeing to the revised terms. If you don’t agree to the revised
            terms, please stop using the Services.
