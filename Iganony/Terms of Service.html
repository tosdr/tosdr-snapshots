    <p><b>Limitation of Liability and No Warranty.</b> The Service and its content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Anonyig makes no representations or warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of the Service or their content, and expressly disclaims any warranties or conditions, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Anonyig SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD-PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD-PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF Anonyig FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (the U.S. $100.00).</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to third-party content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable and/or may cause harm to your hardware and, without limiting the other limitation of liability provisions herein, you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies or claims you may have against the Service.</p>
    <p><b>Indemnity.</b> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Anonyig and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses arising from: (1) your use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (2) your violation of any part of this Terms, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (3) your violation of any third-party right, applicable law, rule, or regulation. Anonyig will not bear responsibility for any damages, claims, liabilities, losses, and other expenses, whether or not a lawsuit or other proceeding is filed, that arise out of the User's breach of these Terms. To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, you and we agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration.</p>
    <p><b>Third-Party Links.</b> The Service may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Anonyig. We don’t endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website, service, or content from the Service, you do so at your own risk and you agree that Anonyig has no liability arising from your use of or access to any third-party website, service, or content.</p>
    <p><b>Miscellaneous.</b> These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by Anonyig without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Anonyig's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
