            <p>With Speedcheck we run a service that gives you the ability to test and analyze network and internet
              connections and monitor their performance based on the generated test results. We may use the results
              generated by you as the basis for our research and analysis business in which we provide network
              performance insights to our customers in a multitude of ways and formats.
              Speedcheck is currently available on iOS, Android as well as the Web. In addition, we license our
              technology to interested businesses in order for them to enable their customers to leverage our technology
              to perform internet performance tests.</p>
            <p>Data we collect when you run a speed test with Speedcheck on any of your devices, on any platform or the
              web:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Test Data: Metrics like ping, download and upload speed, amount of data transferred, test duration
                etc.</li>
              <li>Location Data: If a device supports precise location (based on GPS, mostly the case for smartphones)
                and you have granted access, we record precise device location. We also record non-precise location
                information based on the IP address a test is run from.</li>
              <li>Additional Metrics: We also collect additional points that are interesting in order to measure and
                analyze network and internet performance. These include but are not limited to the IP address you run a
                test from, the network operator (ISP) as well as device, network and hardware identifiers such as Wi-Fi
                names (SSID) or SIM card identifiers (IMEI)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have Speedcheck installed on your smartphone, tablet or other mobile devices and I’ve you have
              granted us the necessary permissions we also sporadically record precise location data with our apps
              running in the background to analyze network and internet performance.</p>
            <p>We have identified the data collected, processed and analyzed by Speedcheck and provided to our business
              partners to be of legitimate interest to our business and are therefore able to process the data along
              with your user information on the legal basis of legitimate interests to operating our business.</p>
            <p>In addition to the aforementioned data which is core to our business, we also generate additional revenue
              by collecting & sharing ad IDs and location data with selected 3rd parties that use the data to show you
              only relevant ads. We ask you for your explicit consent in order to do so.</p>

            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party
              services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>

              third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy.
              These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
              Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS
              requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
