                                    Arbitration for Users Domiciled in The United States. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT
                                    REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK
                                    RELIEF FROM THINGLINK. If you are domiciled in a country for which arbitration is designated
                                    in Section 13(a) above as the exclusive forum for dispute resolution, then you agree to
                                    first contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ThingLink.com">info@ThingLink.com</a> and attempt
                                    to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able
                                    to resolve a dispute you have with us after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any
                                    claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable
                                    relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this
                                    Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
                                    arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for
                                    JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at
                                    <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. The arbitration will
                                    be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and ThingLink agree otherwise. If
                                    you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying
                                    any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the
                                    award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’
                                    fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the
                                    Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the
                                    initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from
                                    JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your
                                    reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and
                                    (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging
                                    in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal
                                    dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                                    entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as
                                    preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary
                                    to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data
                                    security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights by arbitration.
