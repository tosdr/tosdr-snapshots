Child Users will only be able to use a set of fixed phrases to communicate with other users in Quick-Chat Mode and will not have links to social media in our Game.

We will automatically generate randomized usernames for registered Child Users, unless the parent or legal guardian grants the Child User permission to create a custom username.</p><p>Child Users using an Apple or Google family sharing account are not permitted to register another account with us and are subject to the most restrictive privacy settings in the Game.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use and Disclosure</span></p><p>The Personal Information we collect from or about Child Users is used to give them access to certain features of our Game and communicate with a parent or legal guardian about the Child User’s registration, including for the purpose of verifying their information in connection with the registration.

In what situations do we disclose your Personal Information?</strong></p><p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Information for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. These service providers and contractors include our:</p><ul><li>backend service providers such as Epic Games, Inc.;</li><li>e-commerce and merchandising service providers such as Shopify Inc., Dual Wield Studio LLC, and Penny Arcade, Inc.;</li><li>parental and legal guardian consent management providers such as Kids Web Services; and</li><li>player support and moderation service providers such as Keywords Studios Plc and ModSquad, Inc.</li></ul><p>We may also disclose your Personal Information:</p><ul><li>to our subsidiaries and affiliates;</li><li>to our lawyers, consultants, accountants, business advisors, and similar third parties who owe us duties of confidentiality;</li><li>to a buyer or other successor in the event of a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information retained by us pertaining to the users of our Services is among the assets transferred;</li><li>to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, such as responding to a government or regulatory request;</li><li>to enforce any contract we may have in effect with you;</li><li>if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others; and</li><li>if you have consented to such a disclosure.</li></ul><p>We do <strong><u>not</u></strong> sell, rent, or share your Personal Information for cross contextual behavioral or targeted advertising, automated decision-making, or profiling purposes.</p><p><strong>8. How is my Personal Information protected?</strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies</span></p><p>We protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.</p><ul><li><em>Limited retention</em>: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Use if your account has been banned or your access to our Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating our Game or the feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Purpose limitation</em>: We will use your Personal Information only for our Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes. &nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Security measures</em>: We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification, including industry-standard encryption for the transmitting of Personal Information (e.g., DTLS, TLS 1.2+, HTTPS) and industry-standard hashing techniques for the retention of Personal Information (e.g., SHA256+Salt). As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Practices and Activities</span></p><p>Your practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Information. You should take certain steps to help protect your Personal Information, such as being mindful of what you share publicly in our Game, including the below.</p><ul><li>Do not use your real name when selecting a username.</li></ul><ul><li>Do not share your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else with other users of our Game.</li></ul><ul><li>Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please remember that we have no control over what other users do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding other users.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>How do we treat Personal Information transferred to the United States?</strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Business</span></p><p>We may store or process your Personal Information outside of the country where we collect the information or the country in which you reside. Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Policy.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transfer Mechanisms</span></p><p>When transferring Personal Information out of foreign countries, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We use European Commission approved standard contractual clauses and implement related measures where required by applicable law. Please contact us if you have questions related to the relevant transfer mechanism for your Personal Information.</p><p><strong>10. What rights do you have to your Personal Information?</strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right to Access, Correct, Delete, or Restrict Processing</span></p><p>Subject to any limitations and exceptions under applicable law, you have the right to request access to your Personal Information and exercise the below rights.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You have the right to correct or update certain types of Personal Information. In many cases, you can review or update your account information by accessing your account online.</li></ul><ul><li>You have the right to request deletion of your Personal Information. If you choose to have your Personal Information removed from our Services, we will carry out your request within 30 days of account verification, subject to extension, and we will only retain minimal Personal Information to document your request and the actions we took to carry out your request.</li></ul><ul><li>You have the right to restrict certain processing of your Personal Information and the right to object to some types of processing of your Personal Information.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</li></ul><ul><li>You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our collection, storage, or processing of your Personal Information with a data protection supervisory authority in the country where you live or work.</li></ul><p>We will comply with your requests in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law. For example, we are not required to delete your Personal Information if we have an overriding legitimate ground for retaining that information, such as to prevent fraud. Please note that we are legally prohibited from carrying out requested actions in some instances, including (1) when we are unable to confirm your identity or (2) where doing so would adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others. Further, we are not required to carry out a requested action in some instances, including where the request is considered excessive.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are Here to Help</span></p><p>Please email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f0f0d16091e1c063f1611111a0d0c13100b17511c1012"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96e6e4ffe0f7f5efd6fff8f8f3e4e5faf9e2feb8f5f9fb">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> with the subject line “Privacy Request” or mail your request to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073, USA if you would like to exercise any of the rights described above or if you have questions regarding your rights.</p><p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Additional Notice for California,</strong> <strong>Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia Residents</strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">California Online Privacy Protection Act</span></p><p>The following applies to California residents:</p><ul><li>We do not track users of our Services over time and across third party websites or online services and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
