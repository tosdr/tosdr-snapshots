<ol>
<li>Introduction<br/><br/>a. Please read the following Terms of Use (“Terms of Use,” “Terms,” or “Agreement”) carefully. By accessing or using any of the pages or content located on freemusicarchive.org (the “Site”), you (“you” or “User”) indicate that you understand and agree to the Terms of Use. <br/><br/>b. The Terms of Use include all other Site policies, such as the Privacy Policy, which may be found on separate pages on the Site. A list of links to our Site policies can be found <a href="/Site_Policies">here</a>. By agreeing to the Terms of Use, you indicate that you understand and agree to all Site policies.<br/><br/></li>
<li>About the Site<br/><br/>a. The Free Music Archive (the “Free Music Archive,” “FMA,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an online library of audio and video content that the public, including music fans, webcasters, and podcasters, may listen to, download, or stream for free. The Free Music Archive was a project of Auricle Communications, whose mission is to distribute multimedia content for free over the radio or the Internet. In 2019 the FMA was acquired by Tribe of Noise BV, an international music licensing company based in The Netherlands.<br/><br/>b. Content on the Site (“Content”) includes, but is not limited to, written comments, descriptions, reviews, ratings, audio and/or video files, images, scripts, and designs. Content includes, but is not limited to, Member-Generated Content and Site Content (as those terms are defined below) and Curator Content (as that term is defined in the <a href="/Upload_Policy">Uploading Policy</a>).<br/><br/>c. Users include but are not limited to persons who visit the Site or access its Content in any manner, persons who contribute, post, and upload Content of any kind to the Site, and persons who maintain, moderate, or edit Content.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Categories of Use. This Agreement addresses four main categories of use.<br/><br/>a. First, the Free Music Archive allows you to listen to, download, and search for audio and/or video files hosted on the Site. You may incorporate some of the audio and/or video files into podcasts, webcasts, and other multimedia works, subject to the specific licensing terms that govern each audio and/or video file as explained in and linked from Section [11] below.<br/><br/>b. Second, as a registered member (a “Member”), you may post written comments, flag comments, rate songs and albums, and create playlists of audio and/or video files hosted on the Site (“Member-Generated Content,” described and defined more fully in Section [8] below). A Member who wishes to become an editor with the privileges of writing reviews, editing song/album/artist information, and accessing and sorting flagged comments (an “Editor”), must obtain the approval of the relevant Curator (as defined below below).<br/><br/>c. Third, a Curator (“Curator”) or Contributor (“Contributor”) may upload or delete content such as audio and/or video files, written descriptions, and images of album covers to or from their portals on the Site and may submit content to the Free Music Archive blog (“Curator Content”). Within their portals, Curators may maintain artist pages, moderate and delete User postings, control User options such as images and designs, ban Members, and manage and approve Contributors, Contributing Artists, and Editors. We approve Curators at our sole discretion.<br/><br/>d. Fourth, a contributing artist (“Contributing Artist”) may upload to the Site any audio and/or video files in which the Contributing Artist owns all necessary rights (including but not limited to rights in sound recordings and musical compositions embodied in such audio and/or video files). The Contributing Artist must receive an invitation from a Curator or Administrator to establish a Contributing Artist account, after which the Contributing Artist may upload content to the Contributing Artist's page.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Eligibility<br/><br/>a. To use the Free Music Archive, you must be at least thirteen (13) years old and must either be able to form legally binding contracts in your jurisdiction or have legal parental or guardian consent to enter into, agree to, and abide by these Terms of Use.<br/><br/></li>
