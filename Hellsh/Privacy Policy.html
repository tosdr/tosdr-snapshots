			<h2><a class="uk-link-heading" name="personal-data" href="#personal-data">Your Personal Data</a></h2>
			<p>Some of our services allow you to create an account, which some of your personal data may be attached to. So, in the following sub-sections we will go over each bit of personal data that we may store.</p>
			<h3>Unique Identifiers</h3>
			<p>When connecting with a third-party services for login, we store your unique identifier on that service in association with your account to facilitate subsequent logins until you unlink that service.</p>
			<h3>Display Name</h3>
			<p>Your accounts may be associated with a display name, which might be your given name or full name. When you create an account by connecting with a third-party service, we copy your display name on that service to our service.</p>
			<h3>Profile Picture</h3>
			<p>When connecting to a third-party service we store a URL to your profile picture on that service, if applicable, until you unlink that service, so your profile picture with the third-party service can be your profile picture on our service as well without you needing to upload it again.</p>
			<h3>Email Address</h3>
			<p>When connecting to a third-party service, we will copy the email address that you have provided to them, if applicable, until you unlink that service.</p>

			<h2><a class="uk-link-heading" name="email-forwarding" href="#email-forwarding">Email Forwarding</a></h2>
			<p>If you enable email forwarding on netdex.co, we store</p>
			<ul>
				<li>your username and</li>
				<li>your real email address</li>
			</ul>
			<p>in correlation on our email servers to provide the forwarding service.</p>
			<p>Additionally, for all incoming emails, we store:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the sending email server's IP address,</li>
				<li>the sender's email address,</li>
				<li>your real email address,</li>
				<li>the IP address of the receiving email server and</li>
				<li>any transfer metadata and errors (e.g. reason for declining to receive email)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>which we use to improve our spam filters and compliance.</p>
			<p>Currently, we don't enforce encryption for receiving and sending but try to enable it whenever possible, because too many providers don't support it yet.</p>

			<h2><a class="uk-link-heading" name="screenshots" href="#screenshots">Screenshots</a></h2>
			<p>When you upload a screenshot using the LavaShot App, it's uploaded to our server, where it's publically available at its unique link forever unless we receive a correct abuse notice.</p>
