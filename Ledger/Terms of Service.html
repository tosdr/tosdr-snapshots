Eligibility</h2><p class="my-4">To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old or qualify as an adult in your country of residence. If you are usingÂ the Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that: (a) the legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; and (b) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.Â You can only use the Services if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.</p><h2>4.Â Risks and recommendations</h2><p class="my-4">You acknowledge that you are fully aware of all applicable laws and technical constraints relating to the proof-of-stake and proof-of-work blockchains, and to the Services. You acknowledge that you have been warned of the following associated risks and advised of the following recommendations:</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.1 Regulatory changes.</b>Â Blockchain technologies and related services are subject to continuous regulatory changes and scrutiny around the world, including but not limited to anti-money laundering and financial regulations. You acknowledge that certain Services, including their availability, could be impacted by one or more regulatory requirements.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.2 Tax.</b>Â Transactions or operations in Crypto Assets , or more generally Crypto Assets events, including but not limited to exchanges, air-drops, forks, and gains arising from staking, may be considered tax events according to the legislations law under which you are subject to taxation. These rules may be unclear or subject to change, and you are therefore encouraged to consult your own tax or accounting adviser before engaging into Crypto Assets activities.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.3 Technology.</b>Â Users understand that some of the technology supported or made available through the Services are new, untested and not provided by Ledger and therefore outside of Ledgerâs control. Advances in cryptography, or other technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to blockchain networks which could result in the theft or loss of Crypto Assets. Other adverse changes in market forces or in the technology, broadly construed, may prevent or compromise Ledgerâs performance under these Terms.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.4 Cybersecurity.</b>Â Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Ledgerâs products and information systems in several ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, side-channel attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.5 Underlying blockchain protocols.</b>Â All transactions created through the Services are confirmed and recorded on blockchain networks. Such networks are decentralized peer-to-peer networks run by independent third parties, which Ledger does not own, control or operate. We have no control over blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that the transactions you broadcast on the Services will be confirmed and processed. You acknowledge that we do not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets on your behalf and you agree that the transactions you configure through the Services may fail, or may be substantially delayed by the underlying blockchain networks. On occasions, the blockchain protocol of a given Crypto Asset may change, which may have consequences on its key characteristics including but not limited to their availability, name, security, valuation value or the way it operates. Forks entail that forked Crypto Assets may be misdirected or replicated. In any such events, Ledger may decide, at its discretion, to suspend support of the impacted Crypto Asset for as long as Ledger deems necessary. When it so decides, Ledger will endeavor to give you advance notice, but may not be able to. You should keep yourself apprised of such events and make all necessary arrangements.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.6 No retrieval of Private Keys.</b>Â <!-- -->Ledger operates non-custodial services, which means that we do not store, nor do we have access to your Crypto Assets nor your Private Keys. Ledger does not have access to or store passwords, 24-word Recovery Phrase, Private Keys, passphrases, transaction history, PIN, or other credentials associated with your use of the Services. Unless<b> </b>you subscribe to a third-party recovery service, no one is in a position to help you retrieve wallet access. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing, and keeping your credentials in a secure location, away from prying eyes. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your 24-word Recovery Phrase or PIN can gain control of the Private Keys associated with your Ledger Device or of the 24-word Recovery Phrase, and therefore steal your Crypto Assets, without any possibility for you or Ledger to retrieve them.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.7 Keep your credentials safe.</b>Â When you set your Ledger Device up, you must: (a) create and remember a strong PIN that you do not use for any other service; (b) protect and keep your 24-word Recovery Phrase secure and confidential; (c) protect access to your Ledger Device; To learn more about how to use and secure your 24-word Recovery Phrase, we recommend that you visit ledger.com and in particular, or visit Ledgerâs website and in particular,Â <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-a-recovery-phrase" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this page</a>, or the âLearnâ section in Ledger Live and our support WebsiteÂ <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005514233?docs=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.8 Do not trust. Verify.</b>Â Software integrity, especially when connected to the Internet, is very hard to verify. Ledgerâs security model relies on trusted display. This is why the verification of the information on your Ledger Device is paramount. Before you approve an operation, you must always double check that the information displayed on your mobile or desktop screen is correct and matches the information displayed on your Ledger Device. Upon sending Crypto Assets, you are solely responsible for verifying that the recipient address, amount and fees are correct and that they are the same on both your computer or mobile and on your Ledger Deviceâs screen. You also acknowledge that using unverified addresses to receive Crypto Assets comes at your own risk.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.9 Learn more about crypto and the risks involved.</b>Â Before using Ledger Live or any of Ledger Devices, itâs important to learn and understandÂ <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to use your Crypto Assets and the risks involved</a>. To help you with that, Ledger recommends that you visit theÂ <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ledger Academy</a>Â before starting your crypto journey.</p><p class="my-4"><b>4.10 No liability.</b>Â There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in these Terms. Before you use the Services, you are strongly encouraged to carefully assess whether your financial situation and risk tolerance is compatible with such use. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the generality of the Limitation of Liability under these Terms, you hereby agree that Ledger shall have no liability for any loss that incurs as a consequence of the risks highlighted in this section and/or your failure to follow the recommendations herein.</p><h2>5.

Such third party developers of Device Applications are responsible for the said applications and their performance, and for providing support for Device Applications supported on a Ledger Device and on Ledger Live. Ledger may perform code reviews and conduct security audits of Device Applications available on Ledger Live Manager, which does not constitute any kind of endorsement nor any guarantee that those applications are risk-free. Ledger does not warranty that Device Applications will be maintained over time and reserves the right to restrict or suspend access to them from Ledger Live for any reason for as long as deemed necessary.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.1.6 Experimental features.</b>Â In order to accommodate advanced Usersâ requests and to build new features and functionalities, we may release a series of experimental features on Ledger Live from time to time. These features may not be complete and may have not been fully tested, which may present heightened risks. They may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information. You can think of these features as beta features. Ledger does not guarantee the stability, functionality, or long-term support of these features. We do not recommend to use these features unless you are an advanced User with strong technical skills.

Ledger does not provide any guarantees that access to Third Party Services will not be interrupted or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions, corruption or loss of transmitted information, data or funds, and Ledger shall not be liable for any such Third Party Services. You agree to use the Third Party Services at your own risk. It is your responsibility to review the third partyâs terms and policies before using a Third Party Service. Third Party Services may not be available in all languages and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such Third Party Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws in relation to such use. In addition, Ledger reserves the right to block access to these Third Party Services through Ledger Live in particular, but not exclusively, in the event of non-compliance with the applicable regulations by the Third Party partner. We retain the exclusive right to suspend, remove, or cancel the availability of any such Third Party Service for any reason and without prior notice.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.2.3 Personal data.</b>Â Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your personal data. The processing of such data will be handled in accordance with the relevant Third Partyâs privacy policy and best practices.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.2.4 Issues with Third Party Services.</b>Â Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your software or Ledger Device, and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by Third Party Services as Ledger does not provide nor operate the Third Party Services. If you have questions or concerns about how a Third Party Service operates, or need support, please contact the relevant third party directly.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.2.5 Decentralized financial applications.</b>Â Certain Third Party Services are not operated by identified entities, but can be accessed directly through an interaction between the Userâs wallet (whether or not the User uses the Application DeviceDevice Application or the Ledger Device) and one or several programs that are solely deployed and accessible on a blockchain network (i.e. âsmart contractsâ). These Third Party Services allow you to benefit from various services (such as the exchange, lending or borrowing of Crypto Assets) without having to provide your personal information to an intermediary. By using these Third Party Services, you agree that their use may not be subject to terms and conditions nor any other kind of contractual relationship with the third party operating such operator of the service. To the extent you choose to use such Third Party Services, you acknowledge that Ledger is not responsible for any issue in relation with the use of such Third Party Services, including any loss of funds.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.2.6 Fees.</b>Â The use of certain Third Party Services may be subject to transaction fees and/or other fees charged by such Third Party Services. On top of such fees, Ledger reserves the right to charge you fees for the secured and facilitated access provided by Ledger to use such Third Party Services through the Ledger Live (âLedger Feesâ). Ledger Fees may be charged directly to the User or indirectly if already included in the Third Party Fees and paid by the Third Party to Ledger on behalf of the User. In such event, Ledger will fully display all applicable fees and any applicable taxes.</p><h3>5.3 Staking</h3><p class="my-4"><b>5.3.1 General.</b>Â Through Ledger Live, you can stake specific assets to receive rewards for securing Proof-of-Stake (POS) networks. You may choose to stake your assets by delegatingÂ to a LedgerÂ operated validator node or to a third-party validator node. If you choose to stake your assets with a third-party validator node (including the âLedger by Figmentâ node or any other âLedger byâ¦â node), then such staking is subject to theÂ third partyâs staking terms and conditions. LEDGER DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADVICE OR MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT ENGAGING INÂ STAKING OR CHOOSING A VALIDATOR.Â  Ledger reserves the right to modify the list of referenced validators at any time without prior notice.Â </p><p class="my-4"><b>5.3.2 Staking Rewards.</b>Â You explicitly confirm that you are aware that delegation of staking rights to a validator operator listed in Ledger Live does not grant to your benefit any right to request payment of any kind, but merely a potential right to share a reward perceived by the validator. If you stake your assets with a Ledger operatedÂ node, Ledger will beÂ acting as a transaction validator on the applicable Proof-of-Stake (POS) network. If Ledger successfully validates a block of transactions in that network, you may receive staking rewardsÂ granted by such network and Ledger will receive validator fees (at the rate indicated to you when staking your assets with Ledgerâs validator). Your reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network. Please be aware that some Proof-of-Stake networks require that a certain amount of staked assets be âlockedâ (restricted from any use, sale or transfer) for a certain period of time while staking.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.3.4 No custody.</b>Â Ledger will never take custody over any of your rewards or assets and Ledger has no responsibility or control over any Proof-of-Stake network on which Ledger may exercise validation rights delegated by you.

<b>5.3.5 No guarantee of Rewards.</b>Â LEDGER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS OR ANY STAKING REWARD RATES.Â SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE REWARDS IS SUBJECT TO THE PROOF-OF-STAKE NETWORKS AND IS NOT UNDER LEDGERâS CONTROL.</p><p class="my-4"><b>5.3.6 Disclaimer.</b>Â Staking is provided âas isâ. Ledger is not responsible in any way for any failure by any supported Proof-Of-Stake (POS) network to transfer rewards (including any risks of âslashingâ) or for the loss, destruction, or transfer of rewards to the incorrect wallet address. Ledger does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the staking services or that it will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access.</p><h2></h2><h2>6.
