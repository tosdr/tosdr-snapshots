<p><i><span>Web Browser Cookies and Related Technologies</span></i><span><br></span><span>Our site uses cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to provide features such as account logins and shopping carts, to remember user preferences, to engage in advertising and retargeting, as well as to analyze user behavior.&nbsp;Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We use web beacons (also called single-pixel or clear gifs) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically hosted by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. We use web beacons, for example, to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage of our site and tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</span></p>
<p><i><span>Third Party Sites and Services</span></i></p>
<p><span>Our site employs a variety of third-party services. These include payment gateways, shipping providers, content-distribution networks, advertisers, analytics, and monitoring tools. Some of these services store information about users, and may track individuals across sites, applications, and services. These services may collect information in a similar manner as described above, including, for example, IP address, access times, browser type, language, device type, and device identifiers.&nbsp;They can also create inferences about you from this information.&nbsp;By interacting with our services, certain information about user devices may be exposed to third party advertising and analytics using cookies and other tracking mechanism, these third parties include the entities in the charts below.</span></p>
<p><span>As a requirement for using the Google Ads advertisement platform, Adafruit.com has implemented Google Signals, which uses aggregate data about a user who has Ads Personalization turned on in their Google account to serve them ads on other websites related to events they have performed on our website, such as viewing products or adding products to their cart. We do not currently implement Google's 'Enhanced Conversions' which is used to further track a user after completing a transaction - a requirement of which is to send Google first-party information: their email address and/or phone number in hashed form. We believe that hashed first-party data is not truly anonymous, as long as it is easily matched to non-hashed personal information by the receiver, and in this case the attributes of the hashing mechanism are controlled by Google and so we have made this choice on behalf of our users in our use of Google&rsquo;s services</span><span>.</span></p>

Please note also that choosing to reject or remove cookies may prevent certain features or services of our site from working properly. Since cookie opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in a browser, please also note that deleting cookies, using a different browser, or buying a new computer, may require renewal of opt-out choices.</span></p>
<p><b>Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control.</b><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track"><span>Do Not Track</span></a><span>&nbsp;(DNT) and Global Privacy Control are technologies which allows users to tell sites they visit that they don&rsquo;t want to be tracked. They do this by including a signal with each request the browser sends. Where possible without breaking the functionality of our site, we take reasonable steps to honor Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control headers by attempting to serve only third-party services which themselves promise to honor Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control. However, because not all our necessary third-party service providers honor Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control and because implementations may change from time to time, we cannot guarantee that we will always be successful in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span>While we and others give users the choices described in this policy, there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate user choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of nor honor every such mechanism.</span></p>
<p><b>Mobile advertising ID controls.</b><span> iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.</span></p>

If a user posts comments or forum posts, they should remember that this information, together with certain user profile information, may be available to the public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information that users choose to make public.</span></p>
<p><span>We share personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the products you have requested or authorized, including with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this privacy notice (including above in the cookies section).&nbsp;For example, when you provide payment data for a purchase, that information will be processed by a payment processor who may use the information as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, or related financial services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although some of your data may be processed by third parties through the use of behavioral and analytics data described above, we do not otherwise sell, trade, or rent users&rsquo; personally identifiable information to others.

<p><span>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example,&nbsp;we keep access and error logs on active servers for a maximum of 60 days, for the purposes of improving our user experience.</span></p>
<p><b>Location of Personal Information</b></p>

Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal using the contact method described at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>To make such requests, contact us at&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0a666f6d6b664a6b6e6b6c787f637e24696567">[email&#160;protected]</a>.&nbsp; You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.</span></p>
<p><span>We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p><span>If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;), you have certain rights with respect to that information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Notice at Collection.</b><span> &nbsp;At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared, and how long such information is retained. You can find those details in this statement by clicking on the above links.</span></p>
<p><b>Right to Know.</b><span>&nbsp;You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information. Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You may make such a &ldquo;request to know&rdquo; by contacting us using the contact information at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.</b><span> You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and&nbsp; that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.&nbsp;To make a request to correct or delete, please contact us using the contact information at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><b>Right to Opt-Out / &ldquo;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information&rdquo;.</b><span> You have a right to opt-out from future &ldquo;sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA. Note that the CCPA defines &ldquo;sell,&rdquo; &ldquo;share,&rdquo; and &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; very broadly, and our use of advertising and analytics providers may result in their collection of identifiers (IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs), activity data (browsing, clicks, app usage), device data, and geolocation data through our sites and apps when you use our online services. We do not &ldquo;sell&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; any other types of personal information. If you do not wish for us or our partners to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; personal information in this way, relating to your visits to our sites for advertising or analytics purposes, you can make your request by using a Global Privacy Control or using other controls described in the &ldquo;Information Choices and Changes&rdquo; section of this statement. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; or &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; under the CCPA. However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform functions on our behalf. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously &ldquo;sold&rdquo; or &ldquo;shared&rdquo; personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.</span></p>
<p><span>We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.</span></p>
<p><b>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. </b><span>You have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. Note that we do not use sensitive personal information for any such additional purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (&ldquo;California Customers&rdquo;) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.</span></p>
