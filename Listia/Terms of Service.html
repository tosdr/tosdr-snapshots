    By listing or posting items to give away, you aver that you have the unrestricted right to transfer ownership of the items. The posting or listing of items without the intention of giving them away is expressly prohibited and may constitute wire or mail fraud in violation of U.S. and state law.
    <br><br>
    Intellectual property
    <br>
    You agree that all items posted and shipped are legal and do not infringe any intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, and patents.
    <br><br>
    Sexually explicit, pornographic, or obscene material
    <br>
    You agree not to post or ship any items of a sexually explicit, pornographic, or obscene nature.
    <br><br>
    Items in violation of law
    <br>
    You further agree that you will not post or ship any items in violation of the laws or regulations of any state, city, county, parish, township, municipality, federal agency, or other governmental entity.
    <br><br>
    No Service Review
    <br>
    You understand that Listia cannot review items posted to the Service. You agree to assume full responsibility for any items posted to your Account and bid on by you. You agree to indemnify and hold Listia harmless for any violations of law or regulation that arise in connection with the posting to your Account of items resulting in civil or criminal liability.
    <br><br>
    Ownership Transfer
    <br>
    By giving away or shipping an item, you are transferring all ownership rights that you may have in such item and forever waive any claims thereto. Items given away through this service become the sole property of the recipient with no obligation to re-list the item.
    </li>

    <li>5. Shipping and Pickups
    <br>
    You agree to respond to all valid requests to ship or pickup items from ended listings in a timely manner. Failure to promptly arrange for shipping or pickup of items may result in a forfeiture of Credits. You agree to work out shipping expenses with the auction winner outside of the Service.  Listia is not responsible for any lost shipping expenses and cannot refund or help recover shipping expenses for any reason, including lost or stolen items, damaged items or non-shipment.
    <br><br>
    Lost or Damaged Items
    <br>
    Listia is not responsible for any item that is shipped by a member and is lost or damaged in the shipping process. Items lost or damaged in transit are the sole responsibility of the shipping member. In the event that there is a dispute between members regarding the shipment or condition of an item, Listia will attempt to mediate the dispute and may, in its sole discretion, grant or deduct Credits to members who have shipping or condition problems. Listia's mediation is final and binding to all involved parties.
    <br><br>
    Members making inappropriate reports of damaged or lost items may be subject to Credit forfeiture and/or Account suspension, in the sole discretion of the Service.
    </li>

    <li>6. Credit Accounts And Licensing
    <br>
    Listia may charge fees to acquire or use Credits from time to time, and these fees may change at any time. Credits are purchased or distributed at Listia's discretion and are not redeemable for monetary value from Listia.
    <br><br>
    When you receive a Credit, Listia hereby grants you a limited license ("Credit License") to use the Credit as a virtual token to be held, bartered, traded and/or transferred on the Service with other users (and/or Listia), in exchange for permission to access and use content, applications, services, and various user-listed items, in accordance with these Terms of Service. The Credit License is transferable by the holder to any other user, provided that both users comply with these Terms of Service and maintain their Accounts in good standing. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or otherwise expressly permitted by Listia, the Credit License may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition by operation of law or otherwise, and you agree that any attempted disposition in violation of these Terms of Service is null and void. Listia may revoke the Credit License at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) the Credit program is suspended or terminated; (ii) Listia determines that the Account holder has committed fraud or other illegal conduct; (iii) Listia imposes an expiration date on usage of Credits in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) the holder's Account is terminated for violation of these Terms of Service; or (v) the holder ceases to maintain an active Account or terminates this Agreement.
    <br><br>
    You acknowledge that Credits are not real or virtual currency or any type of financial instrument and are not redeemable for any sum of money from Listia at any time. You agree that Listia has the right to manage, regulate, control, and/or modify the license rights underlying such Credits as it sees fit and that Listia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of this right. Listia makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of the features of the Service that will be accessible through the use of Credits, or the availability or supply of Credits. Listia may modify, revalue, or make the Credits and Services more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional.
    <br><br>
    When you win a listing, your winning bid amount in Credits will be subtracted from your Account. When another user wins your listing, you get the winning bid amount in Credits added to your Account, less any stated transaction fees. Credits may also be purchased for a fee from Listia. Credits may be held by Listia in a pending state or in escrow while both parties confirm that the items in the listing have been delivered and received.
    <br><br>
    You acknowledge that except as set forth in this Agreement, purchases of Credits or other goods, content and features of the Service are final, non-refundable, have no monetary value (i.e. are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to use, even if they come with a durational term (e.g. a monthly subscription). Notwithstanding any agreement by Listia to provide a discretionary pro-rata refund or credit in certain circumstances, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, economic, or monetary interest in your Account, Credits, content or subscriptions, which remain the exclusive property of Listia.
    <br><br>
    Dormant Accounts
    <br>
    An Account may be deemed "dormant" when no items have been listed or bids placed within any 1 year period. Dormant Accounts may be closed and any accumulated Credits forfeited without compensation to the Account holder.
    </li>
    
    <li>    7. Indemnification.  <br>
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Listia, its
        officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any
        third party information providers to the Service from and against all
        losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys'
        fees, resulting from any violation of this Agreement (including
        negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing
        the Service.
    </li>

    <li>    8. Third Party Rights.<br>
        The provisions of paragraphs 2 (Use of the Service), and 8
        (Indemnification) are for the benefit of Listia and its
        officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any
        third party information providers to the Service. Each of these
        individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce
        those provisions directly against you on its own behalf.
    </li>

    <li>    9.Term; Termination. <br>

        This Agreement may be terminated by either party without notice at
        any time for any reason. The provisions of paragraphs 1 (Copyright,
        Licenses and Idea Submissions), 2 (Use of the Service),8
        (Indemnification), 9 (Third Party Rights) and 11 (Miscellaneous) shall
        survive any termination of this Agreement.
    </li>

    <li>    10. Miscellaneous. <br>

        This Agreement shall all be governed and construed in accordance
        with the laws of United States of America applicable to agreements
        made and to be performed in United States of America.   You agree that any legal
        action or proceeding between Listia and you for any purpose
        concerning this Agreement or the parties' obligations hereunder
        shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent
        jurisdiction sitting in United States of America .  Any cause of action or claim you
        may have with respect to the Service must be commenced within one
        (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or
        cause of action is barred. Listia's failure to insist upon or
        enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall
        not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the
        course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to
        modify any provision of this Agreement.  Listia may assign
        its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time
        without notice to you.

        <br><br>

        Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
