<br><br>
Notwithstanding any other provision, we partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you or your business. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device, or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your name, postal address, email address, or device ID. Our partners may link the hashed or obfuscated personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our partners may deliver an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website. Your data may be transferred outside of the country from which it was originally collected.
<br><br>
If you do not want to receive email from us in the future, please let us know by sending us email at the above address or unsubscribing from your account settings.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.
<br><br>
Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line.
<br><br>
<b>Sharing of your information:</b>
<br><br>
When you create an account, the following information is shared publicly:

These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites or mobile apps in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie, third party web beacon or tracking pixel on the web site, mobile apps or within emails to collect this information. We may also share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information, such as your email address, solely in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including partners and advertisers.
