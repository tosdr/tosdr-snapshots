  <br />
  In order to protect our users, we opted to use one-way encryption of IP addresses in a way that does not allow for
  it to be associated with any person nor linked to the other information we may have, which we store in a
  non-identifiable way.
  <br />
  Please note, that once the Extension has been removed from your browser by you, we can no longer trace any user
  activity nor can we link you with any unidentifiable information we may have in our database.

<h3>9. Notice to EU Residents under the ”GDPR” </h3>

<p>
  This section applies to you if you are a national of a European Economic Area (“EEA”) member state. This section
  describes our good faith effort to meet our obligations under the GDPR.

</p>

<strong>
  9.1. Personal Data

</strong>

<p>
  The GDPR, defines “personal data” as “…any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
  (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular
  by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to
  one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity
  of that natural person”

</p>

<p>
  For the purposes of our Privacy Policy, the “data subject” is “you” (“your”, “user”). The personal data we collect
  may include:inter alia, the unique User ID we assign to you, as described in this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
  The personal data we collect will only be used and disclosed for the purposes detailed in sections 3 and 4 to this
  Privacy Policy.

</p>

<p>
  Our legal basis for processing personal data: GDPR Article 6.1(a): “the data subject has given consent to the
  processing
  of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes”; GDPR Article 6.1(b): “processing is necessary for
  the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the
  data subject prior to entering into a contract”; GDPR Article 6(1)(f): “processing is necessary for the purposes of
  the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party…”
</p>

<strong>

<p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Please note that we can only meet sufficiently verifiable user
    requests.</span>
  Sufficiently verifiable user requests refer to requests that allow us to reasonably match the information provided
  by the user making the request with the information already available with us,
  insofar non-pseudonymous Personal Data is available.

  collect includes: IP Address; the unique User ID we assign you; the User Agent and version of your web browser; and
  the Operating System and version used by your hardware.
</p>

<p>
  The personal information we collect will only be used and disclosed for the business purposes detailed in sections 5

  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Please note that we can only meet sufficiently verifiable user
    requests.</span>
  Sufficiently verifiable user requests refer to requests that allow us to reasonably match the information provided
  by the user making the request with the information already available with us,
  insofar non-pseudonymous Personal Data is available.

  any personal information of you on record we can provide you with.
