As stated above, we do not log your browsing data and we delete your IP address when you disconnect from the VPN. Here are some examples of whom we share your information with and why:</p><p>To our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, payment processing, data analysis, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, fraud prevention, online advertising, auditing, and other services.</p><p>When you launch the Real VPN app, we may also use your IP address, which we automatically delete after you have disconnected from the VPN, to derive your approximate (city-level) location. When you are connected to the Real VPN, advertisers are prevented from seeing your IP address, however if you are using the free version of Real VPN we may share this approximate (city-level) location. If you are using the paid subscription to Real VPN this approximate (city-level) location will not be collected and will not be shared.</p><p>To a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p><p>Again, we do not require you to provide us with any contact information in order to download or use our VPN product, we do not log or store your IP address after you have disconnected from our VPN servers, and we do not keep logs of your online activities. Therefore, we generally do not have Personal Information to share with law enforcement, and generally do not have the data to provide in response to law enforcement requests.</p><p>However, we may share what Personal Information we do have if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is appropriate:</p><ul><li>under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence;</li><li>to comply with legal process;</li><li>to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence;</li><li>to enforce our terms and conditions;</li><li>to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates;</li><li>to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and</li><li>to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li></ul><p>If you use the paid subscription to Real VPN no information is shared with advertisers.</p><p>We may use and disclose aggregate information that does not allow to identify or otherwise relate to an individual for any purpose, unless we are prohibited from doing so under applicable law.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec101055499" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_45 t-rec_pb_60 r_anim r_showed" data-record-type="106"><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "><div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div class="t-text t-text_md "><p>Third Party Services</p><p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the processing of your Personal Information by Real VPN operator.

When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="t-text t-text_md "><p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p><p>Marketing Communications.
