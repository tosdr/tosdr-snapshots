<p><strong>19. Governing law; venue; time to bring claims.</strong></p>
<p><strong>19.1. Governing Law.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms, your use of the Websites, Games, Organized Play, or Services, your interactions with Wizards, and any issues arising out of them will be deemed entered into in Washington and governed by laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its choice of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>
<p><strong>19.2. Venue &amp; Jurisdiction.</strong>&nbsp;To the extent not covered by Section 20 below, you and Wizards both consent and agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts within King County, Washington, for any claims arising out of these Terms, your use (or inability to use) of the Websites, Games, Organized Play, or Services, or your interactions with Wizards. You waive your right to argue that the state and federal courts in King County, Washington are an improper venue.</p>
<p><strong>19.3. Time to Bring Claims.</strong>&nbsp;In no event will you bring any claim, action, or proceeding related to or arising out of these Terms, your use (or inability to use) of the Websites, Games, Organized Play, or Services, or your interactions with Wizards more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.</p>
<p><strong>19.4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Fees</strong>. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with these Terms, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</p>
<p><strong>20. Dispute Resolution: Arbitration.</strong></p>
<p>We and you both agree to make a reasonable, good faith effort to resolve any disputes between us informally. If we can't, this is what happens next:</p>
<p><strong>20.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration</strong>. You agree to resolve all disputes, claims, demands, or controversies between us in individual binding arbitration. This includes without limitation any claims arising from these Terms, any part of the relationship between you and us, or your use of the Websites, Games, Organized Play, or Services. This section applies whether the dispute or claim is based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>20.2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Initiating Arbitration.</strong> You and Wizards agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. If a party who intends to seek arbitration must, they must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days after the notice is received, the party seeking redress may commence an arbitration.&nbsp;You may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending Wizards a written notice explaining the claim and what remedy you want from Wizards. If you initiate arbitration against Wizards, you must send a copy to Wizards at the following address: Wizards of the Coast LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 1107 Lake Washington Boulevard North, Suite 800, Renton, Washington 98056</p>
<p><strong>20.3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration administration.</strong>&nbsp;Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.</a> (&ldquo;<strong>JAMS</strong>&rdquo;) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures</a> effective July 1, 2014 (You agree that the arbitration shall be administered by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">JAMS&nbsp;</a>in the Seattle, Washington area residents of North and South America; Japan, for residents of Asia; and in London for residents of Europe and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>20.4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Process</strong>.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators and mutually agreed upon by the parties. The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court. JAMS will administer the arbitration and it will be conducted in the English language. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person at a mutually agreed location. The arbitration hearing must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by you and Wizards. JAMS will only have power to arbitrate the dispute between you and us and not in relation to other people under this particular arbitration. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p><strong>20.5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp;You and Wizards agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential. However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment.</p>
<p><strong>20.6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Costs.</strong>&nbsp;Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules and pursuant to applicable law. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10, 000.00 USD), Wizards will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this User Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.</p>
<p><strong>20.7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Additional Terms</strong>. You also agree that: (i) no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar proceeding may be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties); and (ii) and no conclusion of law in any other arbitration may be given any weight in any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between the parties).</p>
<p>YOU AND WIZARDS BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS ARVITRATION PROVISION, WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. We further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation. However, the arbitrator shall have the authority to shift such fees and costs to ensure that you do not pay significant forum fees. In addition, you shall not be required to pay any type of fee or cost in arbitration that you would not have had to pay had you been free to file your claim in court. Discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in a court, but each side will be permitted discovery sufficient to present or defend their claims.</p>
<p><strong>20.8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Waiver of Collective Action (aka Class Action) Remedies.</strong></p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and Wizards agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration. You and we agree that to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other, including without limitation any arbitration involving any other current or former customer, end user or licensee of Wizards, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise; (ii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p>If the agreement in this Section 20.7 not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration is found unenforceable, you and Wizards agree that it will not be severable: this entire section will be deemed unenforceable and any claim or dispute will therefore be resolved in Arbitration as outlined above. The arbitrator may also award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party&rsquo;s individual claim(s).</p>
<p><strong>21. Alpha/Beta Tests</strong></p>
<p><strong>21.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Alpha/Beta Tests.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time, Wizards may allow access to alpha or beta testing of its Games or Services before their full commercial release. The alpha or beta versions of Games or Services are not final; they are released to test the features, capabilities, and performance of the Games and Services. If you are using an alpha or beta version of the Games or Services, this section applies and supersedes any other section of these Terms that conflict.</p>
<p><strong>21.2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Availability.</strong>&nbsp;Providing and maintaining an alpha or beta is at Wizards' sole discretion. You will only be able to access a closed alpha or beta if Wizards designates you as a closed alpha or beta participant. After registering for a closed alpha or beta, there may be a wait to use the Games or Services for a variety of reasons, including our server load and technical capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>21.3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Other Terms.</strong>&nbsp;We give you alpha or beta access to the Games or Services to give you the chance to be involved with something new and exciting we are building! We expect you to understand that this means the Games or Services aren't complete and will go through many changes before full commercial release. This means the following with respect to alpha and beta tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are time-limited and Wizards will decide in its sole discretion when to move on to the next phase.</li>
<li>They may be accessible from limited platforms (e.g., PC only); Wizards will notify you if any other platforms become available for use during the test period.</li>

<li>Wizards may in its discretion change, add, or remove features as part of the process of testing the game.</li>
<li>Wizards may monitor and record any and all communications, including, without limitation, email, in-game chat, forum postings, etc.in or related to the alpha or beta of the Game or Service.</li>
<li>They are not complete and are provided to you &lsquo;as is' without any additional warranties or promises. Wizards will not be liable for incomplete or nonfunctional software, software errors that cause damage to your computer or device or data loss, hardware failures, or disruption of service.</li>
<li>You may be given the opportunity to provide Wizards with voluntary feedback during and after the test in our forums, via bug reports, and other methods. We would appreciate it if you would share your feedback with us so we can make the Games and Services as awesome as possible.</li>
<li>Our invitations are personal; you may not transfer or sell your access to a closed test of a Game or Service.</li>
<li>Wizards may not release a final commercial version of the Game or Service or, if released, it may alter its features, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics at its discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>21.4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Real-Money Transactions in Alpha/Beta Tests</strong>. From time to time, test versions of Games or Services may have features that allow you to purchase licenses to use Virtual Items, Virtual Currency, or other services (collectively, "<strong>Alpha/Beta Purchases</strong>"). IF YOU PURCHASE A LICENSE TO USE ALPHA/BETA PURCHASES DURING A TEST, ALPHA/BETA PURCHASES MAY NOT TRANSITION INTO THE FINAL RELEASE VERSION OF THE GAME OR SERVICE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WIZARDS WILL NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH A REFUND FOR ANY ALPHA/BETA PURCHASES MADE DURING A TEST. If Alpha/Beta Purchases do not transition to the final release version, Wizards will provide you with information that explains what, if any, credit for Alpha/Beta Purchases you may receive once the test has concluded.</p>
<p><strong>21.5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Termination.</strong>&nbsp;Wizards may terminate an alpha or beta test at any time, for any reason or for no reason. If Wizards terminates an alpha or beta test, you must delete the pre-release version of the Games or Services and all materials you received from Wizards in connection with the alpha or beta test. Wizards may require you to remove any elements of the alpha or beta from any hard drives of any devices on which the pre-release version of the Games or Services have been installed. You agree and acknowledge that Wizards termination of the test shall not be grounds for any refunds of any kind, including but not limited to Alpha/Beta Purchases.</p>
<p><strong>21.6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp;If Wizards classifies a beta or some aspects of an alpha or beta confidential, you will receive notice from us. If an alpha or beta is classified confidential, the alpha or beta, your role as a tester, and all information related to the alpha or beta are to be kept secret from everyone (except Wizards) until Wizards informs you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>22. Promotions; Game Keys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>22.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Availability.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time, Wizards may allow you to participate in promotional contests, special gameplay or tournament events, or similar limited-time promotional offers (including, without limitation, organized play events) (collectively "<strong>Promotions</strong>") that may offer prizes or require you to provide additional information about yourself. Each Promotion may have its own rules which you must read and agree to before you participate. Wizards does not make any representations, warranties, or covenants regarding the amount, type, or frequency of access to Promotions you can expect at any time in connection with any of Wizards&rsquo; products or services. You acknowledge and agree that you may not rely upon the continued availability of Promotions and that Wizards will not be liable for any actions you undertake or actions you do not take based on your expectations.

The use of Promotional Codes in unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes, raffles, or for other unauthorized promotional purposes is strictly prohibited.</p>

Wizards reserves the right to determine and modify from time to time the exact nature of any such service credit, including conversion into one or more different types of Virtual Items, products, or services credits.

JAMS will administer the arbitration and it will be conducted in the English language. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person at a mutually agreed location. The arbitration hearing must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by you and Wizards. JAMS will only have power to arbitrate the dispute between you and us and not in relation to other people under this particular arbitration.
