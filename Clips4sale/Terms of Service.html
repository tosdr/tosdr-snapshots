All transactions and interactions facilitated by us are contracts between you and the studio. Although we facilitate transactions and interactions between customers and studios by providing the Website, storing content, and acting as a payment intermediary, we are not a party to any contract between a customer and a studio. We are not responsible for any transactions or interactions between customers and studios. Studios are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on the Website) the pricing applicable to transactions and interactions and the content to which you may be given access or buy. Pricing excludes any taxes, and currency transmission charges, which are extra costs charged to you. For purposes of this section 16.1, “<strong>customer</strong>” means a user who buys content or services from a studio or gives the studio a tip or tribute.</li><li><strong>Clip Cash</strong><ol><li><strong>Acquisition and Use. </strong>You can prepay an amount to us (known as “<strong>Clip Cash</strong>”) using a Clip Cash Card bought through<!-- --> <a href="http://www.clipcash.com">www.clipcash.com</a> that you can later use to make Customer Payments.

Clip Cash is subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Clip Cash. Clip Cash is nonrefundable and nontransferable, except in the case of a refund of the funds loaded within six months of the date of loading.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email before deducting Clip Cash from your account. On determining that there has been no Transaction Activity on your account for 365-consecutive days, every 30 days afterward, we will deduct the lesser of 1% of the Clip Cash in your account and $10 as a service fee for maintaining your Clip Cash account. To avoid deduction of your Clip Cash, all you have to do is log in to the Website and use any of your Clip Cash. When you use your Clip Cash, we will stop making further deductions of Clip Cash from your account. However, you will not be entitled to restoration of any Clip Cash that we have previously deducted from your account.

You must have a valid accepted form of payment to make a purchase. You must comply with any relevant terms or other legal agreement that governs your use of your chosen payment method.

If we must collect or pay any taxes with your purchase, we will charge you those taxes at the time of each purchase transaction.</li><li><strong>Refunds. </strong>All sales and transactions are final. Payments are nonrefundable and fully earned on receipt. There are no refunds or credits for unused Clip Cash. If you are unhappy with a transaction with a studio, please inform that studio. If there is a technical error on the Website, we will work with you to resolve it. We may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist.

If we issue a refund at our sole discretion, we will issue that refund in the form of either a credit to your Clip Cash balance or the payment method you used for your purchase. We will not make refunds in the form of cash, check, or free services. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances, nor does it require us to issue refunds in the future under any circumstance.<!-- --> <strong>This section 16.6 does not affect any statutory right to receive a refund that you may have under the Consumer Rights Act of 2015 or any other applicable law, except that you do not have the right to a refund for (a) digital products after you have started to download or stream these; or (b) sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software, once these products are unsealed after you receive them.</strong></li><li><strong>Billing Errors. </strong>If you believe that we have charged you in error, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after receiving the billing statement in which the error first appeared.

The Company’s and its directors, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers’ maximum liability to you for any claim will not exceed the greater of $200 and the amount you have paid for the applicable purchase out of which liability arose, even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Scope of Disclaimers, Exclusions, and Limitations. </strong>The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations stated in sections 17, 18, and 19 apply to the greatest extent allowed by law, but no more. We do not intend to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you by law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the disclaimer of some warranties, excluding some damages, or other matters, one or more of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations will not apply to you.</li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li><strong>In General. </strong>You will pay the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers (collectively, “<strong>Indemnified Parties</strong>”) for any loss of an Indemnified Party that is caused by any of the following: (a) your access of, or conduct on, the Website, including your User Contributions; (b) your conduct offline; (c) your breach of this agreement; (d) your dispute with any other user, including any studio; (e) your violation of rights of any person, including intellectual property, publicity, and privacy rights; (f) your violation of any applicable law; (g) your tortious acts or omissions; or (h) your criminal acts or omissions. But you are not required to pay if the Indemnified Party’s intentional misconduct caused the loss.</li><li><strong>Definitions. </strong>“<strong>Loss</strong>” means an amount that the Indemnified Party is legally responsible for or pays in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages. A loss is “<strong>caused by</strong>”<strong><em> </em></strong>an event if the loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.</li><li><strong>Indemnified Party’s Duty to Notify You. </strong>If the Indemnified Party has your contact information, the Indemnified Party will notify you before the 30th day after the Indemnified Party knows or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But the Indemnified Party’s failure to give you timely notice does not end your obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to defend or mitigate losses.</li><li><strong>Legal Defense of a Claim. </strong>The Indemnified Party has control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it) unless the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense. If the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense, you will not settle any litigation without the Indemnified Party’s written consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on the Indemnified Party, (2) admits the Indemnified Party’s fault, or (3) does not fully release the Indemnified Party from liability. You and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith on a claim.</li><li><strong>No Exclusivity.</strong> The Indemnified Parties’ rights under this section 21 do not affect other rights they might have.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong><ol><li><strong>Governing Law</strong><ol><li><strong>If you reside inside the EEA/UK</strong>, Cyprus law (including its statutes of limitations) governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles.</li><li><strong>If you reside outside the EEA/UK</strong>,<strong> </strong>Delaware law (including its statutes of limitations) governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles.</li><li>This agreement’s predominant purpose is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.” The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern this agreement, the application of which is expressly excluded.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong><ol><li><strong>If you reside inside the EEA/UK</strong>, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement that are not subject to alternative dispute resolution will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of competent jurisdiction located in Cyprus, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of those courts to resolve those disputes. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.</li><li><strong>If you reside outside the EEA/UK</strong>,<strong> </strong>all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement that are not subject to arbitration will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any state court of competent jurisdiction in New Castle County, Delaware, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of those courts to resolve those disputes. Each party waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of an improper or inconvenient forum.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong><ol><li><strong>ADR/Arbitration</strong><ol><li><strong>EEA/UK Users. </strong>Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint, you may want to contact the alternative dispute resolution provider we use. If you are located inside the EEA/UK, you can submit a complaint to the Cyprus Consumer Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution via its website at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.adrcyprus.com/">http://www.adrcyprus.com/</a>, the Cyprus Technical Chamber (ETEK) Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (ETEK ADR Centre) via its website at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.etek.org.cy/">http://www.etek.org.cy/</a>, or the Interdisciplinary Centre for Law, Alternative and Innovative Methods (ICLAIM) via its website at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.iclaimcentre.org/">http://www.iclaimcentre.org/</a>. Each of these providers charges a fee for making a complaint and if you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can still bring legal proceedings under section 22.2(a). In addition, please note that disputes also may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>).</li><li><strong>Non-EEA/UK Users—Arbitration. </strong>If you are located outside the EEA/UK, all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement are to be settled by binding arbitration with Arbitration Resolution Services, Inc. (ARS) (or a similar online dispute resolution provider if ARS is unavailable). The parties will abide by all rules of ARS, as found on its website at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.arbresolutions.com">www.arbresolutions.com</a>. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The arbitrator may grant whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement. The arbitrator’s award will include costs of arbitration, reasonable legal fees, and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. Judgment on any award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Unless required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this agreement without the parties’ prior written consent.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Injunctive Relief. </strong>The parties acknowledge that breach by either party of their obligations under this agreement could cause irreparable harm for which damages would be an inadequate remedy. Nothing in this section 23 prevents either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Website, in each case without posting a bond or other security and without proof of actual money damages in connection with the claim.</li><li><strong>Recovery of Expenses. </strong>In any proceedings between the parties arising out of this agreement or relating to the subject matter of this agreement, the Prevailing Party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the Prevailing Party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section 23.3, “<strong>Prevailing Party</strong>” means, for any proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the Prevailing Party. If any proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of the settlement of that dispute, neither party will be the Prevailing Party in those proceedings.</li><li><strong>Jury Trial Waiver. </strong>Each party waives its right to a jury trial in proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.</li><li><strong>Class Action Waiver. </strong>All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.</li><li><strong>Limitation on Time to Bring Claims. </strong>A party will not file a claim arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.</li></ol></li><li><strong>General</strong><ol><li><strong>Entire Agreement. </strong>This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us about your use of the Website and supersedes all earlier or contemporaneous agreements between you and us about the Website.
