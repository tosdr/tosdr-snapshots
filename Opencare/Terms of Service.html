        <h2>14. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
        <p>The laws of the State of New York shall govern these Terms of Use. While we will make reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements you may have with Opencare, if these efforts fail you agree that all claims, disputes or controversies against Opencare arising in connection with or in any way relating to the relationship between you and Opencare, including your use of the Site and the Services, (“Claims”) will be determined mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third- party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made independently or with other claims. The party filing arbitration must submit Claims to the American Arbitration Association and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and pursuing arbitration. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will be held at a place chosen by the American Arbitration Association in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your then current residential address, or at some other place to which you and Opencare agree in writing, and the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act. You may obtain copies of the current rules, and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association at using the contact information noted below.</p>
        <p>American Arbitration Association<br/>Website: www.adr.org</p>
        <p>A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer with at least ten (10) years’ experience or a retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will follow the procedures and rules of the American Arbitration Association which are in effect on the date the arbitration is filed unless those procedures and rules are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions, in which case these Terms and Conditions will prevail. Those procedures and rules may limit the discovery available to you or us. The arbitrator will take reasonable steps to protect your customer account information and other confidential information if requested to do so by you or us. Each party to the arbitration will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on the parties.</p>
        <p>YOU AND OPENCARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. UNLESS YOU AND OPENCARE AGREE, NO ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</p>
