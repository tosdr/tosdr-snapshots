We are registered in England and Wales under company number 07455925 and have our registered office at 8th Floor South, Reading Bridge House, George Street, Reading, RG1 8LS, England.</p></section><section><h2>How to contact us</h2><p>You can contact us by using the <a href="/en-us/contact">Contact us</a> link on our site, or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@qmee.com">support@qmee.com</a>.</p></section><section><h2>How we may contact you</h2><p>If we have to contact you we will do so by writing to you at the email address you provided to us on registration.</p></section><section><h2>Service availability</h2><p>Our service is only intended for use by people resident in either the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, France or Germany and accessing it from those countries. You should not use our service if you are resident in another country. We do not represent that content available on or through our site is appropriate or available in other locations. We may limit the availability of our site or our service or software to any person or geographic area at any time. If you choose to access our site from outside the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, France or Germany , you do so at your own risk.</p></section><section><h2>Your status</h2><p>By downloading our software, you confirm that you are legally resident in either the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, France or Germany , that you are accessing our site from that country and that you are at least sixteen (16) years of age. You may only have one user account. Earnings made on any additional user accounts will not necessarily be paid and we have the right to disable any additional user accounts at any time.</p></section><section><h2>Qmee services</h2><h3>Sponsored results</h3><p>The service we make available through our software operates by providing sponsored results when you carry out searches on certain third party search engines, based on your key-strokes. The sponsored results will be displayed in a separate window and are separate from any sponsored results displayed on the search engine&#x27;s results pages. Subject to your compliance with these terms and conditions, when you click on a sponsored result in the Qmee window we may, in accordance with our user payment policy (as amended from time to time), credit a small sum of money (&quot;a payment&quot;) to the user account you have registered with us.</p><h3>Cash rewards for surveys</h3><p>From time to time we may offer cash rewards to users who complete surveys. Subject to your compliance with these terms and conditions, when you complete a survey we may, in accordance with our user payment policy (as amended from time to time), credit a reward into your Qmee account. Rewards will only be credited for surveys that are fully completed. There may be additional limitations on certain surveys or rewards so please carefully read all applicable terms and conditions before deciding whether or not to participate in the survey. The contents of the surveys are provided by third parties and such surveys should not be interpreted as endorsement by us of those third parties. We make no warranties or representations about and assume no responsibility for the content of the third party surveys.</p><p>Any information which you submit as part of a survey (including but not limited to your year of birth, postcode or ZIP code, gender and survey responses) will be shared with the relevant <a href="/en-us/partners">survey partner</a>, Survey information may also be aggregated and shared with other third parties. Please see our privacy notice for further details.</p><h3>Cash rewards for offers</h3><p>From time to time we may offer cash rewards to users who complete a third-party offer. Subject to your compliance with these terms and conditions, and the terms and conditions shown on each individual offer, when you complete an offer we may, in accordance with our user payment policy (as amended from time to time), credit a reward into your Qmee account. Rewards will only be credited for offers that are advertised by Qmee and fully completed. We cannot be held responsible if the merchant fails to report a user&#x27;s sale to us. Merchants have their own rules upon which they determine transactions to be genuine - for example, an attempt to simply earn a cash reward by clicking/registering with no intention to continue to use/buy from the merchant&#x27;s website could be deemed as non-genuine. These rules may or may not be advertised by Qmee or the merchant and may be discretionary.</p><h3>Extra incentivised activity</h3><p>From time to time we may offer extra rewards for completing certain activities within your Qmee account (e.g. survey streaks).</p><p>We reserve the right to limit, suspend or withdraw the extra rewards at any time, or to change the rewards offered.</p><h3>Deal finder service</h3><p>From time to time we may notify you through our software if we believe that a product you have searched for online is available for a lower price on a different site. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the price offered is up to date and accurate but the prices displayed will be provided to us by those third parties and so we do not guarantee that we will offer you the cheapest available price for the product or that the price is reliable, accurate or up to date. Similarly, while we aim to notify you of a price which is cheaper than the price which you are viewing, we do not guarantee that this will always be the case.</p><p>Please note that the products offered are provided by third parties and all purchases made will be via third party sites. Your contract for those products will be with those third parties and on their relevant terms and conditions and notification of the price difference should not be interpreted as endorsement by us of those third parties. We make no warranties or representations about and assume no responsibility for the content of the third party sites and we have no liability to you in respect of such purchases.</p></section><section><h2>How we may use your personal information</h2><p>On creating your user account you will be asked to supply your e-mail address and country of residence. We will also store details of the searches you make when using the service. When you make a request to cash out the balance in your user account we may provide you with the option to submit further information, for instance your age or town of residence.</p><p>More information about how we collect and process your data is available in our privacy policy.</p></section><section><h2>Receiving payments</h2><p>You will only be able to receive payments credited to your user account via PayPal or via such other payment provider that we make available from time to time. Alternatively, you can donate them to one of several charities from a list specified by us, or cash out to a giftcard from a list specified by us. To order a gift card you will need to verify your identity. We will let you know how we require you to do this; we might require you to first cash out (any amount) to your PayPal account or we might require you to go through an alternative identity checking service. If you choose to cash out to a giftcard you will be issued a code to redeem your giftcard. We do not hold any responsibility for the code issued and we will not be able to reissue the code. We reserve the right to remove any giftcards offered at any given time. You will be able to redeem your user account balance at any time, however some giftcards may have a minimum redemption threshold (for example, £5/$5). Please see the specific information provided about each giftcard during the redemption process for details of any minimum redemption thresholds. Options for redeeming your user account balance are subject to change on reasonable notice by us. We will not be liable for any payments owed to you in the event that you provide us with an incorrect PayPal account number or other relevant details. We will also not be liable for any payments owed to you in the event of a catastrophic data, software or server error, cyber-attack or other event that makes it impossible for us to determine the payments that have been accrued.</p><p>We are entitled to suspend your user account at any time at our sole discretion. If your account has not been used for one (1) year or more we will retain the balance in the account, otherwise we will pay the balance of the account to you. We may also suspend your use of our service at any time at our sole discretion.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that we do not have the ability to determine whether or not the cash rewards you earned or redeemed through your Qmee account are considered reportable taxable earnings in your jurisdiction. You are therefore responsible for any and all tax liability arising from, or associated with, your use of the Qmee website and Qmee app, including liability arising from your accrual of cash rewards or your redemption of such cash rewards. As a condition of your continued use of the Qmee website and app, we reserve the right to require you to provide necessary tax reporting information if our records show that you are, or may be, required to report the value of cash rewards to an appropriate tax authority. You will find your full cash rewards history is available to you on your Qmee account History tab on your dashboard. We encourage you, as it is your responsibility, to seek advice of a tax expert in order to determine the tax consequences of your use of the Qmee website and app, and any associated cash rewards earned or redeemed.</p><p>Qmee utilizes Hyperwallet payment services to deliver payments to you. Such payment services are subject to the<!-- --> <a href="https://pay.hyperwallet.com/hw2web/consumer/page/legalAgreement.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperwallet Terms of Service</a> <!-- -->and the<!-- --> <a href="https://pay.hyperwallet.com/hw2web/consumer/page/legalAgreement.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperwallet Privacy Policy</a>.</p></section><section><h2>Friend get friend referral scheme</h2><p>From time to time, we may offer a friend get friend referral scheme, to users designated by us.
