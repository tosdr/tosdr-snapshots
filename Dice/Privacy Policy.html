You also may have the opportunity to submit a resume, curriculum vitae, or other documents you select as relevant to your profile or application.</p>

<p><em>Other Information You Submit</em></p>

<p>We may also collect any other information you submit when you contact us: this includes any information you provide in a submission through our surveys, Contact Support form, chat functions, or other contact methods.</p>

<p><u>Personal Information We Passively Collect: Device and System Information</u></p>

<p>When visitors use the Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were "clicked". Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, MAC address, operating system, device type, mobile ad identifiers, browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application or advertisement, Internet Service Provider (ISP) and browser software used by each user of the Services. In some instances, we may collect geo-location based information for the purpose of helping identify jobs in your area.</p>

<p>The information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked their advertisements.</p>

<p>On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.</p>

<p>On mobile applications, we may send push notifications to your device. You may opt-out of these at the device level.</p>

<p>You may opt out of location-based services by editing the setting at the device level.</p>

<p><u>Searchable Profiles</u></p>

<p>In the past, job seekers may have elected to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only. Dice no longer offers this feature for job seekers, but for those job seekers who had previously registered on this basis, the user's name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on the Sites. If the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will send an email to the job seeker through our system. We will forward the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not be provided directly to the customer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment.</p>

<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons (including pixels), and javascripts are used by Dice and our partners, analytics, and service providers. These technologies are used generally for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and gathering demographic information about our user base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Internet browsers have a “do-not-track” feature that let you tell the Site that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, the Site does not respond to browser “do-not-track” signals. We allow third parties to use the Site to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and other online products or services.</p>

<p><u>Cookies</u></p>

<p>We and our partners use cookies on the Sites. A "browser" or "HTTP" cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user's browsing program. Dice may use browser cookies to personalize a user's pages at our Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, advertising, or to track visits to our Sites. If a user does not want Dice or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user's browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user's ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;To adjust your cookies preferences, please click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dice.com/about/privacy-policy/#cmpscreencustom">here</a>.</p>

<p><u>Pixels</u></p>

<p>We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These pixels are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites. The information that we collect and share does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>

<p>For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a>&nbsp;or you may also opt out by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">here</a>.</p>

<p><u>Web Beacons</u></p>

<p>From time to time we use web beacons. A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Dice to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user's computer.</p>

<p><u>Log files</u></p>

<p>Dice web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.</p>
