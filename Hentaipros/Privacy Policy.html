            recognition
            technology. Facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your facial features
            which are
            detected from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or have
            previously

            <li>match your selfie with your government-issued ID which you will submit or have previously submitted to
                us namely
                to make sure that nobody is impersonating you;</li>

        </p>

        <li><strong>Our Legal Bases under Canadian and European Union (EU) Privacy Law</strong></li>
        <p>To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on several lawful bases to use your data in these ways.
            This means
            we process your Personal Information only where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You provide your consent to do so for a specific purpose: for example, when you allow us to show you
                personalized features or to send you e-mail marketing;</li>
            <li>Biometric information is also processed based on your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any
                time.
                Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any collection, use, processing, or
                disclosure that
                occurred prior to the withdrawal;</li>
            <li>It is necessary to perform our contractual obligations as per our Terms and Conditions for example, to
                create
                your account and subtribe you to the Website;</li>
            <li>It is necessary to comply with legal obligations: for example, we may be required to collect, use, or
                disclose
                your information in connection with civil, criminal, corporate, taxation, regulatory matters, or
                litigation;
            </li>
            <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest which is not overridden by your data protection interests: for
                example, to
                keep the Website safe and secure from fraud and illegal activities;</li>
            <li>It is used to protect your or others&rsquo; vital interests: for example, in case of emergency or to
                prevent a
                crime or fraud, and</li>
            <li>It is used for tasks carried out in the public interest: for example, to combat unlawful behaviour where
                it is
                in the public interest to do so and where the public interest is laid down by applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on the circumstances, we may rely on different legal bases when processing your same information
            for
            different purposes. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;), Switzerland or the
            United
            Kingdom (&ldquo;UK&rdquo;), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed above.</p>

        <li><strong>Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries</strong></li>
        <p>Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using the Website you consent to the transfer of
            information
            that we process about you, including&nbsp;Personal Information, to other countries in which we, members of
            our
            corporate group (affiliates and related entities) or service providers are located. When we transfer
            Personal
            Information to countries outside of the EEA or other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we
            will ensure
            that the information is transferred in accordance with the applicable laws.</p>
        <p>Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as &ldquo;adequacy decisions&rdquo;
            recognizing that certain countries offer a level of protection of your Personal Information that is
            essentially
            equivalent to the EEA. In other situations, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European
            Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations
            provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country.</p>
        <p>For more information or to obtain a copy of our standard contractual clauses, please see the section
            &ldquo;<em>Contact Information</em>&rdquo; below on how to contact us.</p>

        <li><strong>Retention of Personal Information</strong></li>
        <p>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it
            for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.&nbsp;To determine
            the
            appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
            the
            Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal
            Information,
            the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes
            through other
            means, and the applicable legal requirements.&nbsp;Unless we have a legal obligation or a preservation or
            court
            order which would legally oblige us to retain your Personal Information for a specific period,&nbsp;where we
            no
            longer need to process and retain your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice, we will
            delete
            your Personal Information from our systems.</p>
        <p>Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Information upon your request. Information on how to
            make a
            deletion request can be found under &ldquo;<em>Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information</em>&rdquo;.

        <li><strong>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</strong></li>
        <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures)&nbsp;to
            safeguard
            your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees
            are
            permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In
            addition, we
            use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use
            firewalls
            to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information. Please be advised,
            however,
            that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal
            Information.
