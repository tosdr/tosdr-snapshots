That led us to create the YouVersion Bible App, one of the first 200 free apps available when Apple launched their App Store in 2008.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">Since then, YouVersion’s Family of Apps has grown, but one thing remains the same: every product and feature that we provide is crafted with great care and intentionality. Our apps are not just electronic Bible readers—they were created to help you cultivate a deeper relationship with God every day, and to do that in a safe space alongside people you trust.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">You choose what you access. You choose what you share. You choose with whom you share information. Your data is yours. YouVersion and Life.Church do not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">Additionally, every YouVersion product is completely free with no ads or purchases. They are free to individual users and free to our Bible publishing and content Partners. We do this because we never want money to get in the way of people experiencing the power of God’s Word.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">How can we afford to do this? As a digital mission of Life.Church, YouVersion is supported by Life.Church&#x27;s general budget and through contributions from our global Community who want to participate in our mission to help people use technology to draw near to God every day through Scripture and experience life transformation.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information.</p></div><h2 class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-bold text-33 md:text-40 leading-comfy font-aktiv-grotesk mbe-4 mbs-4 id={id}" id="privacy-contents">Content</h2><ul><li><a class="text-yv-red underline" href="/privacy#brief-overview">Brief Overview</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#definitions">Definitions</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#information-we-collect">Information We Collect and How We Collect It</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#automatic-data-collection-technologies">Automatic Data Collection Technologies</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#disclosure-of-your-information">Disclosure of Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#managing-your-information">Deleting, Accessing, and Correcting Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#security-and-protection">Security and Protection</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#processing-of-data">Processing of Data</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#third-party-information-collection">Third Party Information Collection</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#users-from-outside-the-united-states">Users from Outside the United States</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#privacy-policy-changes">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#contact-information">Contact Information</a></li></ul><h2 class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-bold text-33 md:text-40 leading-comfy font-aktiv-grotesk mbe-4 mbs-4 id={id}" id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h2><div class="flex items-start flex-col space-y-3"><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">By accessing YouVersion, you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States.

That led us to create the YouVersion Bible App, one of the first 200 free apps in Apple’s App Store when it launched in 2008.","paragraph3":"As more and more people began using YouVersion, we recognized the value of helping people explore faith in a community with the shared purpose of growing their relationship with God in a safe and secure manner.","paragraph4":"YouVersion is far more than just an electronic reader that allows you to read the Bible on your phone. Every product and service that we provide, we craft with great care and intentionality, designing each feature to help you pursue a deeper relationship with God, and to explore your questions of faith in a safe space, all within the context of a trusted community of your choice. You choose what you access. You choose what you share. You choose who you share information with. Your data is yours. YouVersion does not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.","paragraph5":"And, every aspect of YouVersion that we offer we provide completely free, with no strings attached and no advertising: free to individual users and free to our Bible and content partners. How can we do this? As a digital mission of Life.Church, YouVersion is supported in large part out of Life.Church's general budget and also through contributions from individual users who want to participate in our mission to help people utilize technology to experience the Bible and to see lives changed.","paragraph6":"Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information."},"brief_overview":{"heading":"Brief Overview","paragraph1":"By accessing YouVersion, you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States.

Before we collect or process this information for such features, we will obtain your explicit consent.

We may combine information we have with information of these service providers to facilitate their support. For example, some of the platforms used to send emails and notifications provided through YouVersion are built and managed by third parties, so some of your information is sent securely to those services to provide such functionality. They will have access to your information only as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. We may also provide aggregate, de-identified information concerning connections by YouVersion users with third-parties and their events or locations.","subheading5":"YouVersion content providers.","paragraph6":"We utilize certain third parties to provide certain YouVersion content, such as Bible Plans.

We do, however, provide these third parties with aggregate analytics concerning the use of their content by country using de-identified and anonymized data.","paragraph7":"Our ability to provide different versions of the Bible in different languages is a result of and subject to agreements among us and certain Bible societies and publishers, which we’ll call “YouVersion Bible Providers.” The license agreements we have with some YouVersion Bible Providers only allow us to provide YouVersion users the ability to download certain Bible texts for offline use if we provide YouVersion Bible Providers with the User’s name, email address, and country for future communication. If this is the case with a text you are seeking to download for offline use, we will (i) only share this information with the YouVersion Bible Provider for the offline version you request; (ii) do so on a confidential basis and only if the YouVersion Bible Provider agrees to keep the information we share about you confidential; and (iii) provide an additional prompt to you as a reminder of these terms, which you must agree to at that time in order to continue with your download.

We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. We may also disclose your information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (ii) enforce our agreements with you; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of YouVersion; or (v) exercise or protect the rights and safety of YouVersion, Users, our personnel, or others.

Otherwise, if you request that we delete your account, we will delete your account and all the information we have that is associated with your account, except for aggregated statistics based on de-identified information and inferences we have made (for example, the fact that you downloaded YouVersion, without identifying you or maintaining personal information associated with that account).","paragraph8":"Our deletion of your information and account will generally take no more than fourteen days from your request; however, cached information may take up to thirty days to delete.
