That led us to create the YouVersion Bible App, one of the first 200 free apps available when Apple launched their App Store in 2008.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">Since then, YouVersion’s Family of Apps has grown, but one thing remains the same: every product and feature that we provide is crafted with great care and intentionality. Our apps are not just electronic Bible readers—they were created to help you cultivate a deeper relationship with God every day, and to do that in a safe space alongside people you trust.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">You choose what you access.

They are free to individual users and free to our Bible publishing and content Partners. We do this because we never want money to get in the way of people experiencing the power of God’s Word.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">How can we afford to do this? As a digital mission of Life.Church, YouVersion is supported by Life.Church&#x27;s general budget and through contributions from our global Community who want to participate in our mission to help people use technology to draw near to God every day through Scripture and experience life transformation.</p><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information.</p></div><h2 class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-bold text-28 md:text-33 leading-comfy font-aktiv-grotesk mbe-4 mbs-4 id={id}" id="privacy-contents">Content</h2><ul><li><a class="text-yv-red underline" href="/privacy#brief-overview">Brief Overview</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#definitions">Definitions</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#information-we-collect">Information We Collect and How We Collect It</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#automatic-data-collection-technologies">Automatic Data Collection Technologies</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#disclosure-of-your-information">Disclosure of Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#managing-your-information">Deleting, Accessing, and Correcting Your Information</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#security-and-protection">Security and Protection</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#processing-of-data">Processing of Data</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#third-party-information-collection">Third Party Information Collection</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#users-from-outside-the-united-states">Users from Outside the United States</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#privacy-policy-changes">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a class="underline text-yv-red" href="/privacy#contact-information">Contact Information</a></li></ul><h2 class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-bold text-28 md:text-33 leading-comfy font-aktiv-grotesk mbe-4 mbs-4 id={id}" id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h2><div class="flex items-start flex-col space-y-3"><p class="text-text-light dark:text-text-dark font-aktiv-grotesk text-13 md:text-16">By accessing YouVersion, you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States.
