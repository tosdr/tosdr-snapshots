ThisAgreement governs matters of data protection with respect to Personal Data between the Parties, and shall be in force for as long as Parties Process Personal Data in connection with the Master Service Agreement (the “Agreement”), and it amends any prior agreement between the Parties with respect to data protection matters. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein or in the Agreement, shall take the meaning ascribed to them by Applicable Laws. <br/><br/>1. Client is either a Controller or Processor of Personal Data governed by GDPR and Applicable Laws (“Personal Data”). Client Processes Personal Data directly and through its Processors; Supplier is a Processor (a ‘service provider’) or a sub-processor for Client.  <br/>2. Supplier will Process Personal Data only pursuant to Client’s documented instructions, which may include the Agreement, any other agreement between the Parties with respect to the provision of the Supplier&#x27;s services to Client, and any other     instructions communicated in writing directly to Supplier. Supplier may also Process Personal Data where required by applicable laws to which Supplier is subject, in which case Supplier shall inform Client of that legal requirement before the relevant Processing of that Personal Data, unless prohibited from doing so by law.  <br/>3. Client instructs Supplier to Process the Personal Data for the following purposes: (i) providing the Services, including also fraud prevention, product improvement, and auditing; (ii) fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and any other agreement or lawful instruction; (iii) as required by law. <br/>4. Supplier may only Process the types of Personal Data, relating to such categories of Data Subjects, as are detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong> below. <br/>5. Supplier will maintain an updated list of its sub processors, which will be made available to Client, and Client shall have the right to object, on reasoned grounds, to any sub processor within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such sub processor’s processing. In the event that Client, acting reasonably and in good faith, objects to such processing, then the Client may terminate the portion of the Agreement that requires the employment of said sub processor. Supplier shall ensure that the arrangement between Supplier and each sub-processor is governed by a written contract including terms which offer at least the same level of protection for the Personal Data being Processed hereunder as those set out in this DPA and which meet the requirements of Article 28(3) of the GDPR. A current list of sub-processors is attached hereto as <strong>Appendix B</strong>. <br/>6. Supplier&#x27;s personnel engaged in Processing Personal Data are and will remain committed to confidentiality. Supplier takes not less than industry-appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of its Processing of Personal Data, and meets or exceeds the requirements of GDPR Article 32 and Applicable Laws, as described in <strong>Appendix C</strong> below. <br/>7. Supplier will assist Client in responding to requests for exercising Data Subjects&#x27; rights (GDPR Article 15-22; “Request”). Supplier will inform Client promptly if it receives a Request, and in any event within 72 hours of receiving the Request, and will not take any other action without Client’s authorization. Supplier will likewise assist Client with its obligations pursuant to applicable data protection laws, such as GDPR Articles 32-36, including also data security, data protection impact assessments, and breach notifications. Supplier will inform Client without delay, and in any event within 48 hours, if Supplier experiences or suspects a Personal Data Breach, and will provide full details to Client.<br/>8. Supplier will promptly delete and procure the deletion of Personal Data where so instructed by Client, unless and to the extent that retention is required by applicable laws. <br/>9. Where Supplier transfers EU Personal Data to a country outside the EEA which is not considered to provide adequate data protection, the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”)(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&amp;from=EN) shall apply. For purposes of the SCCs, module 2 (controller to processor) shall apply. In Clause 9 option 2 (general written authorisation) will apply, authorization period will be 14 days. In Clause 11 the optional language will not apply. In Clause 17 governing law will be the Irish law; In Clause 18 disputes shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland.

The appointed official has appropriate recognized information security credentials and qualifications.<br/>3. <strong>Access control</strong>. Access rights are assigned according to the principle that employees and third-parties are only granted the level of access they need toper form their activities (need-to-know principle) and only to those systems required for such activities. Access rights are granted according to defined(role-based) permissions. The access rights granted are reviewed regularly.Rights that are no longer required are withdrawn immediately. Access to systems is provided based on strong authentication policies.<br/>4. <strong>Physical access control</strong>. Secure areas are defined on the basis of information security and data protection requirements and protected against unauthorized access by appropriate physical safeguards, defined based on the protection needs of the information located or accessed within them.<br/>5. <strong>Encryption</strong>.Personal Data encryption at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS v1.2 or higher. <br/>6. <strong>Confidentiality</strong>.Controls are in place to maintain the confidentiality of Data in accordance with the Service Agreement; All employees and contract personnel are bound by our internal policies regarding maintaining the confidentiality of customer data and are contractually obligated to comply with these obligations.<br/>7.<strong>Resilience and continuity</strong>. a variety of tools and mechanisms are used to achieve high availability and resiliency.

Additional information about security provided by AWS is available at https://aws.amazon.com/security andhttps://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/overview-of-security-processes. The production environment within AWS, where customer Data and the services are hosted, is a logically isolated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Network access between production hosts is restricted, using firewalls to allow only authorized services to interact in the production network. Firewalls are in use to manage network segregation between different security zones in the production and corporate environments. Firewall rules are reviewed regularly. <br/>10. <strong>Incident response plan</strong>. Policies and procedures are implemented, designed to detect, respond to, and otherwise address incidents, including specific points of contact in the event of an incident, <br/>11. <strong>System testing and maintenance</strong>.
