                that User uploads, stores or submits to AUDIOTOOL (hereinafter „Content“) are generated by the User, not
                by AUDIOTOOL. Users‘ Content therefore remains in Users‘ sole property and responsibility.</p>

            <p>AUDIOTOOL does not claim any ownership rights in any Content deriving from User.<br>
                User acknowledges that Content uploaded or transmitted through AUDIOTOOL may be protected by copyrights,

                acknowledges that copying tracks or samples of someone else requires the author's prior permission.
                User must not upload, send, transmit or otherwise make available any Content in which User does not have
                the appropriate rights to do so. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public performance or
                other unauthorized use of copyrighted works by User may constitute an infringement of the copyright
                holder's rights and may result in civil litigation and criminal prosecution.</p>

            <h3 id="3">3 Information and Communication</h3>

                AUDIOTOOL
                services, for example through the FAQ. User can also send questions to AUDIOTOOL using the email

                AUDIOTOOL
                will generally send this information by email to the email address User provides. It is therefore in

                liability relating to the Content or to the Users´activities.</p>

            <p>User acknowledges and agrees that AUDIOTOOL cannot and does not generally review the Content created and

                connections

                state of communication technology, AUDIOTOOL cannot totally rule out the possibility of such
                curtailments occurring. This applies especially to Content and transmission media which are beyond

                AUDIOTOOL
                services. AUDIOTOOL always endeavours to keep such restrictions reasonable and as low as possible. When
                usage will be restricted or interrupted because of maintenance or development work, AUDIOTOOL will give
                User as much advance notice as possible - by email or other electronic means (e.g. an announcement on

                systems, where this is appropriate, particularly for the protection of telecommunication and data
                processing systems.</p>

                User can at the time

                end
                AUDIOTOOL offers a range of different release options that AUDIOTOOL considers as reasonable and
                practicable.</p>

            <p id="6.2">6.2 AUDIOTOOL lays no claim to usage or exploitation rights in relation to Users‘ Content.

                on audiotool.com User
                may want to change a license on Content he/she already uploaded and published. If User decides to
                further tighten
                copyrights on Content he/she already published, User agrees that this shall only apply to the use of the
                respective
                Content in future after the date of change in the license. A retrospective limitation of a given
                copyright is by
                definition not implementable.</p>

            <p id="6.5">6.5 User acknowledges that the tightest copyright license given by the author, will always be

                principles of
                conflict of laws (international private law).</p>

            <p>Should one or more provisions of the present Terms and Conditions be unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
                such
                provision(s) shall be deemed and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
                provisions under
                these Terms and Conditions. The remainder of the Term and Conditions will thus remain in full force and
                effect.</p>

            <h3 id="13">13 Termination of the Agreement</h3>

            <p id="13.1">13.1 User may terminate this Agreement by giving notice of two weeks. To terminate the
                agreement, User should contact
                our Service department at the address below or send an email to team -at- audiotool.com.</p>

            <p id="13.2">13.2 AUDIOTOOL has the right to terminate the agreement with User without notice if User
                culpably violates these
                terms and conditions or applicable legislation and AUDIOTOOL can no longer be expected to reasonably
                adhere to the
                Agreement. AUDIOTOOL is also entitled to a statutory notice of termination by giving two weeks' notice
                to terminate
                this agreement. The notice of termination will be sent by email to the email address User provided.</p>

            <p id="13.3">13.3 If AUDIOTOOL terminates the agreement, User will only be able to re-register for AUDIOTOOL
                services with
                AUDIOTOOL's express consent. AUDIOTOOL Users are not permitted to grant access to AUDIOTOOL services to
                former
                AUDIOTOOL Users to whom AUDIOTOOL has sent a notice of termination.</p>

            <p id="13.4">13.4 Once the termination becomes effective, User will no longer be able to use AUDIOTOOL
                services. When the
                agreement comes to an end, AUDIOTOOL will initially block content User has stored. The content will be
                deleted
                within six months after the agreement comes to an end.</p>

            <p id="13.5">13.5 This does not affect Users' right to terminate the agreement on compelling grounds.</p>

            <p id="13.6">13.6 AUDIOTOOL reserves the right at any time to suspend, discontinue, terminate or close down
                its Website and/or
                Services (or any part of it), temporarily or permanently, without notice. User agrees that, AUDIOTOOL
                and its
                respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors,
                officers and
                shareholders shall not be liable to User or to any third party for any suspension, discontinuance,
                termination or
                close down of AUDIOTOOL and/or Users‘ possibility to use or access AUDIOTOOL.</p>

            <h3 id="14">14 Changes to the terms and conditions, changes to features</h3>

            <p id="14.1">14.1 In view of the constant state of change of Internet-based services, AUDIOTOOL reserves the
                right to modify our
                terms and conditions, features and prices. This shall apply particularly if the changes do not result in
                any
                fundamental legal or economic disadvantage to the User, for example in the event of changes to the
                registration
                process, changes to contact information or the inclusion of additional services.</p>

            <p id="14.2">14.2 AUDIOTOOL will give Users adequate notice of any important changes to these terms and
                conditions or to features
                or prices. This information will be sent by email to the email address that User provides.</p>
