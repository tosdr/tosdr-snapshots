                                If you are creating a Teleparty with participants from multiple countries, you should double-check that the show you want to watch together is available to everyone on the same streaming service. You can use <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/" target="_blank"

                                As a general tip you should consider watching Netflix originals, which are available
                                in

To cancel your subscription, follow these steps:
                                <br />    
                                    1.) Click on the TP button in the top right of the browser<br />

Your account will revert to the free version of Teleparty at the start of the next billing cycle, where you can continue to host free watch parties and enjoy all of the other free features.
