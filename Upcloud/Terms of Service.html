If the Relevant Personal Data needs to be transferred outside the EEA in a country that is not recognised by the European Commission as providing adequate level of protection for personal data, then the Customer accepts that UpCloud performs the international transfer of the Relevant Personal Data in accordance with the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (processor-to-processor module) entered into by UpCloud (as data exporter) and the relevant subprocessor (as data importer).</p><h4>11. Audits</h4><p>11.1. Upon written request of the Customer, UpCloud agrees to make available to the Customer and, where relevant, to the End-Customer, the information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA, and allow for and contribute to audits by the Customer or an established third-party auditor approved by UpCloud (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and agreed by both Parties (“<b>Mandated Auditor</b>”), of UpCloud’s systems and premises where the processing of Relevant Personal Data takes place, in order to assess UpCloud’s compliance with this DPA. UpCloud shall permit the Customer, or, where relevant, a Mandated Auditor to inspect and audit UpCloud’s relevant records solely pertaining to the Relevant Personal Data, and to inspect and audit processes and systems related to the processing of the Relevant Personal Data. UpCloud agrees to co-operate in respect of such audits. All audits by the Customer, or, where relevant, by Mandated Auditor are subject to a thirty (30) days’ prior written notice.</p><p>11.2. Where an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets of UpCloud (or its Affiliates or other customers) or otherwise pose a threat to intellectual property rights of UpCloud, the Customer shall employ a Mandated Auditor to carry out such audit. Whenever a Mandated Auditor is used, the Customer shall procure such Mandated Auditor’s acceptance to be bound to confidentiality to UpCloud’s benefit by way of such confidentiality undertaking as accepted by UpCloud.</p><p>11.3. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the Customer is allowed to conduct one (1) audit in every twelve (12) months. Any audit must be conducted during the normal business hours of UpCloud and in a way that does not cause substantial disturbance to UpCloud’s business operations. The Customer shall bear all costs and expenses relating to the audits conducted hereunder and pay a reasonable compensation to UpCloud for the work required to assist in the audits.</p><h4>12. Data Breaches</h4><p>12.1. UpCloud shall notify the Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any Data Breach, providing the Customer with sufficient information which allows the Customer to meet its obligations to report a Data Breach under the Data Protection Laws. Such notification shall at a minimum:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px">(i) describe of the nature of the Data Breach, including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Relevant Personal Data records concerned;</p><p style="padding-left: 40px">(ii) communicate the name and contact details of UpCloud’s contact point where more information can be obtained; and</p><p style="padding-left: 40px">(iii) description of the measures taken by UpCloud to address the Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</p><p>12.2. UpCloud shall cooperate with the Customer and, where relevant, the End-Customer, and take commercially reasonable steps to assist in the investigation, mitigation and remediation of the Data Breach.</p><h4>13. Deletion and Return of Personal Data</h4><p>13.1. For deletion and return of the Relevant Personal Data, the Customer shall primarily use the functionalities of the Service through the Control Panel.</p><p>13.2. The Customer agrees that within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, or after the Customer has permanently ceased to use the Services, UpCloud shall delete and procure deletion of all copies of the Relevant Personal Data processed by UpCloud or any subprocessor, unless UpCloud is obliged to retain copies of the Relevant Personal Data pursuant to applicable laws or orders of Governmental Authority.</p><h4>14. Liability</h4><p>14.1. Each Party’s liability for: (i) damages incurred by a data subject and (ii) administrative fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority, in connection with the processing of the Relevant Personal Data under this DPA shall be defined in accordance with Articles 82 and 83, respectively, of the GDPR, or another corresponding and applicable provision of compulsory Data Protection Laws.</p><p>14.2. Otherwise the Parties’ liability for a breach of the DPA shall be subject to Section 19 (Limitation of Liability) of the main body of the Terms of Service.</p><h4>15. Term</h4><p>15.1. This DPA remains in force until UpCloud ceases to process the Relevant Personal Data pursuant to the Agreement, whereafter this DPA shall automatically expire.</p><section id="appendix1"> <b>APPENDIX 1 – UpCloud Subprocessors</b><br /></section><p>UpCloud may utilise its Affiliates (some of which are located outside the EEA) in the provision of the Service, as may be necessary for the provision of the Services ordered by the Customer.</p><p>UpCloud’s Operations Team members may need to work with or handle resources containing Customer Data when maintaining UpCloud’s data centre infrastructure or resolving issues reported by the Customer (e.g. moving storages from one physical host machine to another physical host machine in the same data centre). As the Article 4 of the GDPR provides a very extensive definition for ‘processing‘, such actions can be deemed as processing under the GDPR even though they do not entail accessing the Customer Data. Therefore UpCloud considers some of its Affiliates as subprocessors regardless of the data centre(s) the Customer has selected.

Scope.</b> This service level agreement (“<b>SLA</b>”) is an integral part of the Agreement between UpCloud and the Customer. This SLA does not apply to: (i) Free Trials; (ii) UpCloud website; (iii) APIs of the Service; and (iv) the Control Panel.</p><p><b>2. Service Guarantee.</b> Subject to the exemptions set out in Sections 1 and 8 of this SLA, we will guarantee you the availability of the Services. For all unscheduled interruptions in the provision of the Service that last longer than five (5) minutes, you will be entitled to an SLA-compensation in accordance with this SLA. The availability guarantee is applied on a per Service-item basis and is not applicable to such Service-items that are not directly affected by the interruption. For example, if you have five virtual servers and one of them is unavailable, the SLA-compensation will be calculated based on that one server’s downtime and not based on your entire Service portfolio.</p><p><b>3. Scheduled Interruptions.</b> We will notify you by e-mail or by publishing a notice on UpCloud’s website about scheduled interruptions in the provision of the Service at least 24 hours prior to the interruption, with the exception of important security updates and patches which we may deploy without prior notice.</p><p><b>4. Error Notifications.</b> If you detect an interruption in the Service, you have to notify us by sending an e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9cf3e9e8fdfbf9efdce9ecfff0f3e9f8b2fff3f1">[email&#160;protected]</a>. The interruption in the Service is deemed to begin when the failure starts to affect your use of the Service, and to end when the failure has been corrected. We will maintain a system status page at<a href="https://status.upcloud.com/?_ga=2.231260956.2047200324.1681193158-1397398912.1667313581"> https://status.upcloud.com/</a> where we will post information about identified interruptions and their resolution status.</p><p><b>5. Payment of Compensation.</b> If you are eligible for an SLA-compensation under this SLA, you must claim the SLA-compensation within 15 (fifteen) days after the failure has been corrected by contacting our Support Team at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c4b7b1b4b4abb6b084b1b4a7a8abb1a0eaa7aba9">[email&#160;protected]</a> and requesting the SLA-compensation. The SLA-compensation will be deposited to your Account in the form of Credits and it may not be exchanged for cash or other forms of payment.</p><p><b>6. Amount of SLA-compensation.</b> The amount of the SLA-compensation will be 50 (fifty) times UpCloud’s service fees charged for the interrupted Service-item allocated for the period of time when the use of that Service-item was interrupted. The maximum SLA-compensation for an individual interruption shall be limited to an amount equal to the service fees charged by UpCloud for the interrupted Service-item during 30 (thirty) calendar days immediately preceding the interruption. The total sum of aggregated SLA-compensations during any 12-month period shall be limited to an amount equal to the average monthly service fee charged by UpCloud for the interrupted Service during that 12-month period multiplied by 2,5.</p><p><b>7. Sole Remedy.</b> The SLA-compensation set out above will be your sole remedy for any interruptions in the Service. In case of a disagreement over the amount of the SLA-compensation payable to the Customer, UpCloud’s decision on the issue will be binding on the Parties until and unless a competent court rules otherwise.</p><p><b>8. Exemptions from Service Guarantee.</b> The following situations will be exempt from UpCloud’s service guarantee and thus not subject to SLA-compensation:</p><ol><li>Scheduled interruptions and deployment of important security updates and patches.</li><li>Force Majeure events.</li><li>Failures caused by errors in Third-Party Products utilised by the Customer within the Service.</li><li>Failures in products or services which are not part of the Service or provided by UpCloud.</li><li>Failures caused by the Customer’s actions contrary to user instructions or resulting from the Customer’s operating systems or application software used within the Service.</li><li>Interruptions in the Service relating to the Customer’s violation of or failure to comply with these Terms or a User’s violations of the Acceptable Use Policy.</li><li>Failures caused by hostile actions of third parties, such as denial-of-service attacks.</li><li>Interruptions relating to actions UpCloud is obliged to take pursuant to applicable laws or Governmental Authority’s orders.</li><li>Interruptions resulting from the Customer not having sufficient balance of Credits on the Account for the use of the Service at the time of the interruption.</li></ol><section id="acceptable-use-policy"><h2 style="margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 0.5em">Acceptable Use Policy</h2></section><p><b>1.
