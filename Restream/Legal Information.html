Especially when it comes to customer data and its verification through the Restream Live Video Streaming Service. But it is still advised to engage services of a legal counsel to have a better understanding of GDPR compliance and the liabilities that come along with it for your organization. The following compliance guide is the practices, procedures and upgrades introduced in the internal working of Restream to make its services GDPR complaint.<br><br><b>  Here is a summary of GDPR sections that are applicable to users of Restream services.</b><br><br><br><b>  Cookies</b><br><br>            GDPR only allows collection of user data for a legal reason.

Restream has taken steps to provide full control to the end-users about their data that they have submitted for identity verification for login. This can be deleted via their account settings or contacting a Customer Service Representative via chat or email.<br><br><b>  Restream Plan for GDPR Compliance</b><br><br>            Restream Users and Enterprise partners should feel confident that we are both knowledgeable and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that are under our control. This directive set by the European Union, a legislation that set forth guidelines regarding how information is collected and how it is processed and used.<br><br>            The GDPR legislation was formed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. Empowering all EU citizen’s data privacy in the process, and to reshape how organizations approach data privacy in a secure and transparent manner.<br><br>      At Restream, we deploy commercially reasonable efforts to assist our users, businesses and our clients. To help them understand, what the GDPR means for their businesses and to assist them in establishing a compliant process of their own. Considering that aspect, we have made great improvements to our Restream platform to ensure that we stand at par with the critical components of GDPR measures.<br><br><b>  The Restream Process:</b><br><br>            Let us say that Daniel Streamer is a potential customer and lives in France.

BACKGROUND</b><br><br>  Restream Inc. provides Restream Live Video Streaming Services for EU based enterprises that can provide accounts for employees and other individuals. According to the GDPR such process requires the implementation of data processing agreement (<b>  “DPA”</b>  ) and, in case of international transfers, standard contractual clauses (<b>  “SCC” or “UK SCC”</b>  ) between the Processor and the Controller. Annex A of this DPA forms the SCC or UK SCC between Controller and Processor.<br><br>  This DPA and SCC applies to the extent where data is regarded as personal data by EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR). Restream Inc. representative in terms of GDPR is Restream Estonia OÜ, the legal entity established in Estonia, address Telliskivi tn 60a/8, 10412, registry code 16183126.<br><br>  The client hereby instructs Restream Inc. to process the data as described in this DPA.<br><br><b>2. PARTIES</b><br><br>  Client (<b>  “Data Controller”</b>  or<b>  “Controller”</b>  ) and Restream (<b>  “Data Processor”</b>  or<b>  “Processor”</b>  )<br><br><b>3. PERSONAL DATA</b><br><br>  3.1. The personal data of individuals transferred by the Controller to the Processor during the implementation of Restream Live Video Streaming Services.<br><br>  3.2. No biometrics or other type of special categories of data is processed to provide Restream Live Video Streaming Services. <br><br>  3.3. Categories and Purposes of Data Processing:<br><br>  3.3.1. Enterprises (Controllers) can create multiple accounts for employees and other individuals. During the sign up of the accounts, the Controller transfer to Processor usernames and email addresses. Any other personal data (ip address, password hash encrypted, timezone created_at time, google_token, blog_posts_read, stripe_id for Restream to verify payment was made for accessing the service, selected_language, two_factor_auth) is created automatically during the sign-up process and is not, therefore, part of this DPA.<br><br>  3.3.2. Video stream and screenshot images are never stored or captured by the Processor unless the Client requests otherwise. In the latter situation, the content is stored for 30 days period. Therefore the Processor does not by default process any personal data attached to the video content.<br><br><b>4. SERVICE</b><br><br> This DPA covers Restream’s Live Video Streaming Services provided by the Processor.<br><br><b>5. CONTROLLER OBLIGATIONS</b><br><br>  5.1. Controller is responsible for having valid legal grounds for the use of employees or individuals data while importing data subjects’ personal data to Processor.<br><br>  5.2. Controller is responsible for sufficient notifications and transparency in place for data subjects to be informed of the use of Restream Live Video Streaming Services.<br><br><b>6. PROCESSOR OBLIGATIONS</b><br><br>  6.1. Processor processes Controller’s data only for the purpose of providing, supporting and improving Processor’s services, using appropriate technical and organizational security measures.

The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws in the United States applicable to the processing of the personal data by Restream, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorizing access by public authorities, prevent Restream from fulfilling its obligations under these clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) GDPR, are not in contradiction with the clauses.<br><br>  4.2. The parties declare that they have taken due account in particular of the following elements: (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the content and duration of the contract; the scale and regularity of transfers; the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the nature of the personal data transferred; any relevant practical experience with prior instances, or the absence of requests for disclosure from public authorities received by the data importer for the type of data transferred; (ii) the laws of the United States, including those requiring to disclose data to public authorities or authorizing access by such authorities, as well as the applicable limitations and safeguards; (iii) any safeguards in addition to those under these clauses, including the technical and organizational measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the United States. <br><br>  4.3.

Restream agrees to promptly notify the Client if, after having agreed to these clauses and for the duration of the DPA, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws not in line with the requirements, including following a change of the laws the United States a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements under paragraph 3.1. <br><br>  4.5. If the Client otherwise has reason to believe that Restream can no longer fulfil its obligations under the clauses, the Client shall promptly identify appropriate measures (such as, for instance, technical or organizational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the Client and / or Restream to address the situation, if appropriate in consultation with the competent supervisory authority. If the Client decides to continue the transfer, based on its assessment that these additional measures will allow Restream to fulfill its obligations under the clauses, the Client shall forward the notification to the competent supervisory authority together with an explanation, including a description of the measures taken. The Client shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.

If Restream is prohibited from notifying the Client and / or the data subject, Restream agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicate as much information and as soon as possible. Restream agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them upon request of the Client.<br><br>  5.3. To the extent permissible under the laws of the United States, Restream agrees to provide to the Client, in regular intervals for the duration of the DPA, the greatest possible amount of relevant information on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority or authorities, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). <br><br>  5.4. Restream agrees to preserve the information for the duration of the DPA and make it available to the competent supervisory authority upon request. <br><br>  5.5. Clauses 4.1 to 4.3 are notwithstanding the obligation of Restream to promptly inform the Client where it is unable to comply with these clauses. <br><br><b>  6. Review of legality and data minimization </b><br><br>  6.1. Restream agrees to review, under the laws of the United States, the legality of the request for disclosure, notably whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority and to challenge the request if it concludes that there are grounds under the laws of the United States to do so. When challenging a request, Restream shall seek interim measures with a view to suspend the effects of the request until the court has decided on the merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules.<br><br>  6.2.
