      <p>Prior to registering you for a newsletter subscription, we obtain your consent to email marketing by way of a so-called double opt-in process. This means, after you create your IDAGIO account, we send an email to the specified email address, in which we ask for confirmation that you wish to receive emails from IDAGIO. If you do not confirm this request, the data submitted in the respective request is erased or is stored for other purposes, where a legal basis or obligation for continued storage exists. In addition, we store the IP addresses you used as well as the times of the request and the confirmation. The purpose of the process is to verify you are the owner of the email address used to create the IDAGIO account, that you consent to email marketing and, if necessary, to be able to investigate a possible abuse of your personal data.</p>
      <p>The only mandatory information required to receive the newsletter is your email address. After you have provided confirmation, we will store your email address for the purpose of sending the newsletter.</p>
      <p>The newsletter is sent using the service provider, Braze.

Further information on the AppsFlyer service can be found in Part A, Section 7.7.</p>
      <p>Our newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”. This is normally a single pixel sized file which is accessed from the Braze and Appsflyer servers when the newsletter is opened. When the file is requested, firstly technical information is collected, such as information regarding the browser and your system as well as your IP address and the time of the request. This information is used to improve the content and technical delivery of the services using the technical data or the target groups and their usage behaviour. The data collected also includes a determination as to whether the newsletter has been opened, when it is opened and which links are clicked on.</p>

  <h4>1.2 GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Explanation and purpose of the processing:
      <p>We use Google Analytics on our websites, a web analytics tool from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies" which are stored on your PC and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie includes, for example, browser type/version, operating system used, screen resolution, referrer URL (the website visited prior to this one), anonymised IP address of the computer used to access the website, time spent on individual pages, time of server request, time spent on individual pages, files downloaded, videos watched, advertising banners clicked on, active orders, sequence of clicks etc. You can find more information on the cookies used by Google here.</p>
      <p>This information could, in some circumstances, be transmitted to one of Google's servers in the USA and stored there. Insofar as Google processes data outside the EU and the EEA, respectively, we make sure that an appropriate data protection level is achieved by way of EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
      <p>We use Google Analytics on our websites with an IP anonymisation tool. With this tool, your IP address recorded by Google Analytics is, in Member States of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, first abbreviated by Google and thus transmitted in anonymised form.</p>
      <p>Google uses the information collected on our behalf on the basis of a contractual agreement entered into between Google and ourselves, in order to statistically evaluate the use of the website for us in aggregated form, to create reports on the website activities and behaviour of users on our website and to provide us with other analysis services related to the website and its use. These reports assist us in designing our website and content according to the needs of users and in continuously improving it. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the scope of Google Analytics is not associated with other data from Google.</p>
      <p>We also use Google Analytics to analyse visitor streams across devices. This is performed in pseudonymous form on the basis of random user IDs assigned by us (Universal Analytics). You can deactivate the cross-device analysis of your use in the settings of your Google user account under “Privacy Settings”.</p>
      <p>The maximum retention period we have chosen for data associated with cookies or user IDs and advertising IDs is 14 months. After this time period has expired, the data will be automatically deleted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Prevention of storage of cookies:
      <p>You can prevent cookies being stored by adjusting your browser settings accordingly; moreover, you can delete stored cookies using your browser. Preventing or deleting cookies may render, in some circumstances, the use of certain functions of the website impossible or inconvenient.</p>
      <p>In addition, you can deactivate the Google Analytics function using a browser add-on which you can download here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. To do this, you must install that browser add-on on all devices you use. This prevents the analysis information from being sent to Google. Alternatively, you can set a so-called opt-out cookie by clicking on the link which prevents data being collected by Google Analytics in future. Please note, however, that on deleting cookies in your browser settings, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted and must be set once more.</p>

  <h4>1.4 GOOGLE ADS</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Explanation and purpose of the processing:
        <p>We use Google Ads conversion tracking on our website, a tracking tool from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
        <p>Whenever you click on an advertisement displayed by Google, a cookie is stored on your computer for conversion tracking purposes. These cookies expire after 30 days and do not contain any personal data. If you arrive on our website via an advertisement displayed by Google, this enables Google and us to know that you have clicked on the advertisement and have thus been forwarded to this site. The information obtained with the aid of the conversion cookie serves the purposes of compiling conversion statistics for Google Ads customers in order to track the effectiveness of certain advertisements. These tell us the total number of users who have clicked on their advert and been forwarded to a particular page. However, we do not receive any information on individual users and their behaviour which we are able to trace back to a particular user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Prevention of storage of cookies:
      <p>You can prevent cookies being stored by adjusting your browser settings accordingly; moreover, you can delete stored cookies using your browser. Preventing or deleting cookies may render, in some circumstances, the use of certain functions of the website impossible or inconvenient. </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Explanation and purpose of the processing:
      <p>On our websites, we use remarketing tools from Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”).</p>
      <p>In this context, Facebook collects data, using a JavaScript code (“Facebook Pixel”) about users’ behaviour on websites on which the Facebook Pixel has been embedded. In this way, for example, the behaviour of users can be tracked after they have clicked on a Facebook advertisement and been forwarded to the respective advertiser’s website. This process helps us to analyse statistically the effectiveness of the advertising we purchase from Facebook and to optimise our advertising. If you have a Facebook account, Facebook might associate this data with your account and can thus create a direct connection to you. In the context of the data collection by the Facebook Pixel, data is sent to Facebook’s servers in the USA. Insofar as Facebook processes data outside the EU and the EEA, respectively, we make sure that an appropriate data protection level is achieved by way of EU Standard Contractual Clauses. More information about the collection and use of data by Facebook and your rights and options to protect your privacy in this respect can be found in the Facebook data policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.</p>
      <p>The processing of your data in connection with Facebook is performed on the basis of your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time by blocking Facebook Pixels. Revoking consent has no influence on the legitimacy of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent prior to the revocation.</p>

  <h5>4. COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN YOU BOOK THIRD PARTY SERVICES THROUGH OUR WEBSITE OR OUR MOBILE AND/OR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS</h5>
  <p>With your user account you can purchase third party services through the IDAGIO software which grant you access to contents which are provided through such third-party services (e.g. streaming of live concerts). Such third-party services are identified accordingly on our platform. In such cases, the respective third party is responsible for the offer, your purchase and the transaction of the service.  IDAGIO acts on behalf of the respective third party as a platform provider on the basis of a third-party data processing agreement. The technical processing of your purchase as well as the processing of your payment is performed by the service “Ticket Gretchen” of Ticket Gretchen GmbH, Mariahilfer Straße 109/20, 1060 Vienna, Austria. Ticket Gretchen GmbH processes your personal data (payment data and user ID) solely in accordance with and on our behalf and in its role as a subcontractor on the basis of a third-party processing agreement.

  <ul>
    <li>Country of purchase</li>
    <li>Time and date of purchase</li>
    <li>Your payment information, including credit or debit card number and other card information (together: “Payment Details”)</li>

  <p>Your Payment Details are sent directly to the payment services provider Ticket Gretchen on the basis of a third-party processing agreement but not to us or to the third party offering the service. Accordingly, this data is not stored by us. Ticket Gretchen communicates the last four digits of your credit or debit card number as well as the expiry date of the card to us. These digits can be displayed in your user account so that you can check at any time which payment method you are using to pay for your subscription.

This only applies to the collecting of such data. For the use of such data for the respective own purposes as outlined above the data controller is the third party and IDAGIO, respectively. IDAGIO and the third party offering its services through the IDAGIO Platform have concluded a joint data controlling agreement which specifies whom to contact to exercise your right as a Data Subject.

  <h5>5. COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN YOU USE OUR WEBSITE AND OUR MOBILE AND/OR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TECHNICAL PROVISION OF THE IDAGIO SERVICES</h5>
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin">
    <li>Explanation and purpose of the processing:
      <p>When you use our website or our mobile and/or desktop applications, we process the following personal data automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the IP address of your computer or other end device (e.g. tablet PC or smartphone)</li>
        <li>Information about the devices which you used our IDAGIO services with: type of device, individual device ID and operating system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The IP address as well as information about your devices are technically required for the retrieval and use of the website and the mobile and/or desktop applications. Without the processing of this data, the website and the mobile and/or desktop applications cannot be accessed and they cannot be displayed.</p>
      <p>If you use an end device which runs on the iOS operating system (Apple end devices), in place of the device ID, we use the so-called “Advertising Identifier” (IDFA). This is a unique but non-personalised and non-permanent identification number for a particular end device and is provided by iOS. We use this IDFA only as a device identifier but not to provide you with personalised advertising. You can activate the option “Limit Ad Tracking” in the iOS settings under “Privacy” - “Advertising” in order to prevent the IDFA being sent to us. You can delete the IDFA in the device settings at any time (“Reset Advertising Identifier”). By doing so, a new IDFA is generated which is not associated with the previously collected data. We would note that you might not be able to use all of the functions of our app if you make use of the option to limit the IDFA.</p>
      <p>In addition, we assign you an internal user ID for the purposes of managing your user account. This user ID also enables us to de-link certain personal information in the scope of some data processing procedures, in particular those involving third parties (e.g. in the scope of the billing process with our licensors).</p>
      <p>In addition, the user ID and IP address are processed by us for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to our website and our mobile and/or desktop applications</li>
        <li>Ensuring the comfortable use of our website and our mobile and/or desktop applications</li>
        <li>Analysis of system security and stability</li>
        <li>For other administrative purposes in the scope of providing our service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find more information on how we collect this data in Part A, Section 3. To process and structure this data in log files, we use the service Papertrail. More information on the Papertrail service can be found in Part A, Section 7.1.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Legal basis:
      <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) first sentence (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest in the processing is in technically enabling the retrieval of the IDAGIO services, ensuring a comfortable use of our services and ensuring system security and stability.</p>

    <li>Right to Object:
      <p>As far as data processing based on Art. 6 (1) first sentence (f) GDPR is concerned, you have a right to object, without prejudice to other rights. For more on this, see below (Part A Section 9, d): "Rights of the Data Subject")</p>
