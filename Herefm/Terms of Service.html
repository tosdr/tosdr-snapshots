<span class="c7">
Welcome!</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
We&rsquo;ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) so you&rsquo;ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and H3R3, Inc. (&ldquo;Here.fm&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here&rdquo;). So please read them carefully.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
By using Here.fm, our video conferencing tools, design tools, or any of our other products or services that link to these Terms (we refer to these collectively as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t agree with them, then don&rsquo;t use the Services.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.pwi6ddd3kc95">
<span class="c7">
1. Who Can Use the Services</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
By using the Services, you state that:</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_gii7waua08k3-0 start">
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You can form a binding contract with Here.fm</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction&mdash;including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You are not a convicted sex offender.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.wr5lesz6xick">
<span class="c7">
2. Rights We Grant You</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Here grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services&rsquo; benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies allow.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device&rsquo;s settings.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.75hn6l9ybplw">
<span class="c7">
3. Rights You Grant Us</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. Content can be images, files,
notes, messages, drawing or anything else that you add to a Here room. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Here and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. In short, you want to post images in a room or share a file with visitors to a room, and you need to grant us a right to the images or file in order to do that.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
While we&rsquo;re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service. You also agree to adhere to the Copyright and Safety sections of this agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, a room URL is not your content; all room URLs are the property of Here and can be changed at our sole discretion at any time.
</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.1pd96vs0tr3c">
<span class="c7">
4. The Content of Others</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Much of the content on our Services is produced by users and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Here reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot&mdash;and do not&mdash;take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Through these Terms and our Content Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services, or that our users&rsquo; use of our Services, will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.leaqjk9q39bm">
<span class="c19 c26">
5. Privacy</span>
</h2>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c20 c8">
You agree that Here may access, preserve and disclose your account information if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) as required by law or to comply with legal process; (b) as required to enforce our User Terms; (c) to provide you with customer support for the Services; (d) to respond to any claims that User Content or Organization Content violates the rights of other parties; or (d) to protect the rights, property or safety of Here and other Users on the Services or the Public at large</span>

6. Respecting Others&#39; Rights</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Here respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that:</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_cq1z61oi0nt-0 start">
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right.</span>

</ul>
<p class="c25">
<span class="c7">
7. Respecting Copyright</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Here honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if Here becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user&rsquo;s account.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please file a notice with our designated agent:</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c15">
email: </span>
<span class="c15">
copyright@here.fm</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Don&rsquo;t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c15">
If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at </span>
<span class="c11">

</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</span>
</li>

<span class="c4">
provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</span>

8. Safety</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can&rsquo;t guarantee it. That&rsquo;s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_49umsboyfwge-0 start">

</li>
<li class="c14">

You will not use or attempt to use another user&rsquo;s account, username, or password without their permission.</span>

9. Your Account</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Here account. So it&rsquo;s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don&rsquo;t use for any other account.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_dski29j4ptdw-0 start">
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You will not create more than one account for yourself.</span>

<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You will not share your password.</span>
</li>
<li class="c14">
<span class="c4">
You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.</span>

<span class="c15">
If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to Here Support</span>

<h2 class="c10" id="h.oh5frtij0s64">
<span class="c7">
10. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you&rsquo;re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c10" id="h.6hcebgqoxk3q">
<span class="c7">
11. Third-Party Services</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party&rsquo;s terms will govern the respective party&rsquo;s relationship with you. Here is not responsible or liable for a third party&rsquo;s terms or actions taken under the third party&rsquo;s terms.</span>

If you use any embedded YouTube functionality provided to you through Here's interface, you agree to be bound by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">YouTube's Terms of Service</a>.

12. Fees</span>
</h2>
<p class="c2">
<span>
We do not charge a fee to use the basic functionality of the Services. &nbsp;We reserve the right to charge for the Services in the future, and will provide you with ample notice before making any changes to our fee structure. &nbsp;You may have to pay a fee to use certain features of the Services that are not part of basic functionality. &nbsp;We may make additional virtual content available for purchase.</span>

<span class="c7">
13. Modifying the Services and Termination</span>
</h2>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
We&rsquo;re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
While we hope you remain a lifelong Here user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Here may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
<span class="c4">
Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Here continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 12-21 of the Terms.</span>
