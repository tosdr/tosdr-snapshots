                        claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Application or the use of the Application by any person using your account,
                        including any claim that your use of the Application violates any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party, and/or your
                        violation of these Terms.</p>

                    <h3>Exclusion of Liability</h3>
                    <p>In no event will Cirkled In be liable to you or any third party for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary or consequential or punitive
                        damages of any kind, or any loss of data, opportunities, reputation, goodwill, profits or revenues, related to the services (e.g. offensive or
                        defamatory statements, down time or loss, use or changes to your information or content) arising out of or in connection with the application
                        or any other application and/or content included on or otherwise made available to you through the application, regardless of the form of
                        action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or are aware of
                        the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for all causes of action and under all theories of liability will be limited to the amount you
                        paid to Cirkled In. This section will be given full effect even if any remedy specified in this agreement is deemed to have failed in its
                        essential purpose.</p>

                    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including
                        attorneys’ fees, costs, penalties, interest and disbursements) we incur in relation to, arising from, or for the purpose of avoiding, any
                        claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Application or the use of the Application by any person using your account,
                        including any claim that your use of the Application violates any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party, and/or your
                        violation of these Terms.</p>

                    <h3>Termination</h3>
                    <p>If you breach any of these Terms, we have the right to suspend or disable your access to or use of the Application. Account deletion/
                        suspension may result in deletion of any content associated with your account.</p>

                    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Cirkeld In regarding the use of the Application, superseding any prior
                        agreements between you and Cirkeld In relating to your use of the Application. If a court with authority over this Agreement finds any part of
                        it not enforceable, you and Cirkled In agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent.
                        If the court cannot do that, you and Cirkeld In agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of
                        this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that Cirkled In has waived its right to enforce this Agreement.
                        You may not assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Application) to anyone without our consent.
                        However, you agree that Cirkled In may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.
                        There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>

                    <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>You agree that the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Agreement and/or use of the
                        Application. We both agree that all of these claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts of King County, Washington, USA, and
                        we each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

                    <h3>Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Please let us know what you think of the Application and these Terms. When you provide us with any feedback, comments or suggestions
                        about the Application, you irrevocably assign to us all of your right, title and interest in and to your feedback, comments and suggestions.</p>

                    <h3>Questions and Contact Information</h3>
                    <p>Questions or comments about the Application may be directed to us by sending email to help@cirkledin.com.</p>

Dear Friend,

We have found a safe and secure digital place to capture and share kids' and students' activities and achievements at one place. Achievements in academics, sport, music and other extra curricular activities that tend to get forgotten in daily busy life. By recording these on regular basis at one place, we prepare our students for the future like college admission, internship or any other opportunity.

We thought you will also benefit from this platform. Please checkout the website https://www.cirkledin.com.

Thanks.
