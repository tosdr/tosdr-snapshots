<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits consumers in California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes, one time per year. A24 may share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com">DPO@a24films.com</a>, or send us a letter to A24 (Attn: Legal), 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001. Requests should include “Shine the Light Request” in the email subject line or the first line of the letter, and should include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Also, any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services and who have posted content or information on the Sites or Services can request that such information be removed by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com">DPO@a24films.com</a>. Requests must state that the user personally posted such content or information, and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view.</p>
<p>In addition, where provided for by applicable United States federal or state privacy laws, you may be entitled to exercise some or all of the rights described below with respect to your personal information:</p>
<ul><li>Access / Right to Know: You have the right to confirm whether we process personal information about you and to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.

Your selections are specific to the device, website, and browser you are using, so you should make your selections on every device and browser you use to access this website. Your selections are also deleted whenever you clear your browser’s cache.</li><li>Limit the Use of my Sensitive Personal Information: In relation to any sensitive personal information identified in Section 2 above, you can request that we limit our use and sharing of such information only to those uses which are necessary to carry out our relationship with you (such as providing our goods and services that you’ve requested, maintaining the quality of our services, or protecting our services against illegal activity), or as otherwise described in relevant privacy laws.</li></ul>
<p>We may deny certain requests, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your U.S. privacy rights, such as by denying you goods or services, charging you a different price or rates for goods or services, or providing you a different level of quality of goods or service.<br></p>
<p>How to Exercise Your United States Privacy Rights</p>
<p>Eligible individuals may request to exercise their privacy rights by submitting a request to us by either emailing us at <a href="mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com">DPO@a24films.com</a> or sending a letter to A24 (Attn: Privacy), 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001, or clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link at the bottom of this webpage.</p>

Our legitimate interests include, without limitation, those interests described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, such as the effective and lawful operation of our business, promoting our products and the Services, and operating, protecting, and customizing our Sites. We also process your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests when responding to your requests, and when such processing is necessary for us to comply with any legal obligations. You have the right to object to processing of your personal information based on our legitimate interests.</li><li>Legal Claims – it is possible that we may need to process your personal information in order to defend or establish a legal claim (for example, claims relating to the sale of our goods and services under contract law).</li></ul>

When processing is restricted, we can still store your information (for example, we keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be blocked to make sure the restriction is respected in future).</li><li>The right to object: You have the right to object to certain types of processing, in particular processing based on our legitimate interests. You also can object at any time to your information being used for direct marketing purposes (including profiling related to such direct marketing). </li><li>The right to refuse or withdraw consent: You have the right to refuse to provide, or to withdraw, your consent to processing of your personal information at any time with effect for future processing, when the processing is based on your consent.</li></ul>

<p><strong>8.3. Other Jurisdiction Privacy Rights</strong>.</p>

If available pursuant to applicable data protection law, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com">DPO@a24films.com</a> to make a request. We will respond in accordance with applicable data protection law.<br></p>
<p class="big-type">9. Retention Period for Personal Information.<br></p>
<p>We delete personal information within a reasonable period after we no longer need to use it for the purpose for which it was collected (or for any subsequent purpose that is compatible with the original purpose). We may archive personal information for a certain period prior to its final deletion, as part of our ordinary business continuity procedures. To determine the appropriate retention period with respect to any particular type of personal information, we rely on the following criteria: the necessity of the information to provide our services to our customers; the types and sensitivity of personal information being processed; regulatory requirements that we are subject to, including laws and regulations related to tax, employment, accounting, and securities; and whether a legal claim might be brought against us, for which the information would be relevant.<br></p>

<p class="big-type">10. No Children Under 13.</p>

<p>The Sites and Services are intended for a general audience and not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age.

When you provide personal information to us, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information by both A24 and its Service Providers, including to the United States and other countries that do not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission (this means that the Commission has not determined that the laws of the United States and other countries provide legal protection equivalent to European Union data protection laws). </p>
<p>Our transfers of personal information outside of the EEA or UK are subject to contracts (including the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses) with our data processors, sub-processors, and Service Providers, which require such recipients to treat personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p class="big-type">12. Data Security.</p>
<p>We take measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is never completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our Sites or Services.
</p>
<p class="big-type">13. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Service indicates your acknowledgment of the Privacy Policy then posted. If the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice.
</p>
<p class="big-type">14. Contact Us.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or would like to make a complaint about how we process your personal information, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com">DPO@a24films.com</a>, or send us a letter to A24, 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001.
