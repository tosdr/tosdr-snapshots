          <h1 class="headline">Terms of Use</h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>Effective Date: April 22, 2022.</p>
<p>Last Updated: October 4, 2023.</p>
<p class="big-type">1. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) set forth a legally binding agreement between you and A24 Films LLC (“<strong>A24</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>”), and govern your use of any website, mobile application, or online service location that posts a link to these Terms (each, a “<strong>Site</strong>”), and all features, content, subscriptions, products, and other services that we own, control and make available to you that mention or identify these Terms (collectively, with the Sites, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). These Terms govern your access to and use of the Service. <br></p>
<p>By visiting the Site or using the Service in any way, including by making any purchases or browsing the Sites, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations, and you acknowledge our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in our <a href="https://a24films.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the Service. WITHOUT LIMITING ANYTHING HEREIN, YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS MEANS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATED TO CONDUCTING THIS TRANSACTION ELECTRONICALLY, DISCLAIMERS OF A24’S WARRANTIES, DAMAGE AND REMEDY EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION, WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL, AND A CHOICE OF NEW YORK LAW (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN).</p>
<p>In some instances, both these Terms and separate terms and conditions (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”) will apply to your use of the Service. This may include promotions, sweepstakes/contests, subscription services, auctions, and loyalty and rewards programs, as well as return policies for certain transactions. We will notify you to the extent Additional Terms apply to your use of the Service. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless they expressly state otherwise.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time for any reason, which shall be effected by posting the updated Terms here. Your use of the Service after we post any changes to these Terms constitutes your agreement to those changes from the date of such changes. You agree to review these Terms periodically to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version. </p>
<p class="big-type">2. Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; Choice of Law</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. DO NOT USE THE SERVICE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING BINDING ARBITRATION TERMS (the “<strong>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</strong>”).<br></p>
<p><strong>A. We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</strong></p>
<p>You and A24 agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms, any Additional Terms, the Service, the Content, or our <a href="https://a24films.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate A24’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights), A24 may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. </p>
<p><strong>B. What is Arbitration.</strong></p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.</p>
<p><strong>C. Arbitration Procedures.</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service, the Content, or our <a href="https://a24films.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>”) in front of one arbitrator. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a> or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or A24 must do the following things:
</p>
<ol><li>Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a demand for arbitration at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/submit/" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com/submit/</a>. 
</li><li>Send three copies of the demand for arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.
</li><li>Send one copy of the demand for arbitration to the other party.</li></ol>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden, and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>D. Authority of Arbitrator.</strong></p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and A24, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and A24.</p>
<p><strong>E. No Class Actions.</strong></p>
<p>YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. You may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>F. Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong></p>
<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and A24 in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND A24 WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>
<p><strong>G. Choice of Law/Forum Selection.</strong></p>
<p>In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, NY.<br></p>
