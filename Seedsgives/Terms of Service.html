It is not intended to be investment or financial advice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Anonymous Gifts and SEEDS Awards, and Nurturance of the SEEDS-ETH Pool</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When gifts are made anonymously in cryptocurrency, in order to comply with AML/KYC legislation in the United States, SEEDS awards may not be sent.  Anonymous gifts will be designated to the general pool, as are recurring gifts, and will be allotted to needs through internal decision-making processes (about which more details are provided in our <a href="https://www.seedsgives.com/faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a>).  As with all gifts, 100% of the value given will go to those in need, and will be sent in SEEDS.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If a gift is of suspicious origin and/or there is any indication that awarding SEEDS, or sending a gift in SEEDS, may jeopardize the well-being of the Seeds community or the SEEDS-ETH pool, Seeds Inc. will take any necessary steps to set boundaries to prevent this, which may include delaying a SEEDS transfer, creating a vesting schedule for its disbursal, or, when no other option is available, preventing its transfer.  This may include instances in which there has been a change to a Request for Help such that it impacts the decision to allot funds from our general pool toward that Request for Help, e.g. the removal of the original requester from a project, etc.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Electronic Communications</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Visiting seedsgives.com or sending emails to Seeds constitutes electronic communications.

You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a Communication Service, you will not: defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or information; upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy of publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents; upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer; advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose, unless such Communication Service specifically allows such messages; conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters; download any file posted by another user of a Communication Service that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner; falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded; restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Communication Services; violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable for any particular Communication Service; harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses, without their consent; violate any applicable laws or regulations.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seeds has no obligation to monitor the Communication Services. However, Seeds reserves the right to review materials posted to a Communication Service and to remove any materials in its sole discretion. Seeds reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seeds reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Seeds's sole discretion.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any Communication Service. Seeds does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, Seeds specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized Seeds spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Seeds.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload the materials.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This agreement extends to the content of Requests for Help themselves.  When a user redeems a SEED to make a Request for Help, that user is solely responsible for the content of the request.  Seeds specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the content of Requests for Help and any actions resulting from your participation in giving to a Request for Help.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If an individual receiving SEEDS believes the amount received was calculated incorrectly (i.e. not reflective of the SEEDS market price at the moment the gift was made), we ask that they alert Seeds of the issue within 30 days of receiving the SEEDS.  A failure to do so constitutes an agreement that the amount of SEEDS received was correct.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Penalties for Dishonesty, Abuse &amp; Breach of Conduct</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If and when someone is behaving with hostility, showing abusive verbal or physical action or unkindness, Seeds reserves the right to require that they step away from engagement with the Seeds community in all forms, and/or request that they step away from the community unless or until they complete a 10-day Vipassana course.  Such a ban renders the offender ineligible for any Seeds-awarded bonuses, including but not limited to the SEEDS staking bonus and SEEDS sent in thanks for gifts, for its duration.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We also reserve this right if and when we discover that someone has been dishonest when completing a Request for Help form.  Any active Requests for Help within the system will then be rendered void, and any funds raised toward those will be delegated to another request or requests.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, if someone is found to be abusing the bonuses in ways damaging to the Seeds community (i.e. a person who is making larger gifts to receive larger bonuses and then quickly selling those rewards on the market), they may be asked to step away from the Seeds community as well.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If someone fails to honor their commitment to pay for a course on a monthly basis or is otherwise dishonest in alleging a disputed payment, following the model used with the intention of serving the highest good of all at Vipassana meditation courses, we also reserve the right to ask that they step away from the Seeds community (including as it pertains to making Requests for Help), and they may be subject to collection of unpaid fees, including any incurred through payment disputes they initiated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All such individuals may complete a <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index" target="_blank">free Vipassana course</a> at more than 200 centers worldwide.  If they do so and produce proof of the course’s completion, we will reconsider the ban.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Materials Provided to seedsgives.com or Posted on Any Seeds Webpage</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seeds does not claim ownership of the materials you provide to seedsgives.com (including feedback and suggestions) or post, upload, input or submit to any Seeds Site or our associated services (collectively "Submissions").

Seeds reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Seeds in asserting any available defenses.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Arbitration</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Seeds agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Liability Disclaimer</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS.
