<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">1.1 The SignalRGB Platform offers its users smart-device software and hardware products designed to provide immersive gaming and video experiences.  This is accomplished through the SignalRGB Platform by enabling its users ("<strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Members</strong>" or "<strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Customers</strong>" or "<strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Subscribers</strong>") to utilize screen-analysis technology with paired computer peripheral devices such as keyboards and mice to produce RGB LED and other lighting effects that respond to on-screen events.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">1.2 Members alone are responsible for their use of the SignalRGB Platform.

Neither Whirlwind FX nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the SignalRGB Platform  will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, breach of third-party warranties, computer or peripheral device damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the SignalRGB Platform, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with Customers or potential customers or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the SignalRGB Platform, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Whirlwind FX has been informed of the possibility of such damage. The limitations of damages set forth in this Agreement are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Whirlwind FX and you.  </strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">10.2 You agree that under no circumstances shall Whirlwind FX be held accountable for damages of any kind, legal or otherwise; injuries (physical, psychological, emotional or otherwise); disagreements, controversies or disputes; or any other harms or potential harms arising out of your use of the SignalRGB Platform and any meetings between Members and Customers or potential customers to provide Member Content or any other services. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Whirlwind FX from any harms or potential harms or any damages, legal or otherwise, that may arise out of the meeting of a Member and third-party for the provision of Member Content. Likewise, under no circumstances is Whirlwind FX liable for any harms or damages or potential harms or damages arising out of a meeting of, between, or among a Member, Customer, Subscriber or any third-party for <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">any</em> reasons including those other than the provision of Member Content or any other service described under this Agreement, or via the SignalRGB Platform.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">11. Indemnification and Data Privacy</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">11.1 You agree to release, defend (at Whirlwind FX's option), indemnify, and hold Whirlwind FX and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies, (ii) your improper use of the SignalRGB Platform or any SignalRGB Services, (iii) your interaction with any third party, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, participation or use as set out in (but not limited to) Paragraph 10.2 above, (iv) Whirlwind FX's Collection and Remittance of any required taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Whirlwind FX and its affiliates and principals from any damages or liabilities arising out of any breach of data privacy laws or regulations with respect to Customers, potential customers, or any individual from whom you collect data, including personal data. This includes the European Union Data Protection Directive (95 46 EC) and the General Data Protection Regulation and other similar laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which you operate or provide services.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">You agree to comply with all data and personal privacy laws, regulations and directives, including those of the European Union and all other jurisdictions in which you reside, operate or provide services, and that it is solely your duty to ensure compliance with such laws, regulations and directives, and not that of Whirlwind FX.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States, but bring any claim against Whirlwind FX in the United States.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.2 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. Whirlwind FX is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Whirlwind FX's customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">AAA</strong>") using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules. Specifically, the process provides:</p>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased" class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">www.adr.org</a>);</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">
<li class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party's individual claim.</li>
</ul>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.3 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Whirlwind FX each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact Whirlwind FX's customer service team by <u class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">emailing us</u>. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased" class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.4 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and Whirlwind FX mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the SignalRGB Platform, the Member Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration (the "Arbitration Agreement"). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Whirlwind FX agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.5 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and Whirlwind FX each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.6 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and Whirlwind FX acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.7 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and Whirlwind FX acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and Whirlwind FX</strong> <strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">12.8 <em class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Severability</em>. In the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">13. Feedback</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">13.1 We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the SignalRGB Platform ("<strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">Feedback</strong>"). You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the <u class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">"Contact"</u> section of the SignalRGB Platform, or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">14. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">14.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12 must be brought in state or federal court in the State of California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in the State of California.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC"><strong class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15. General Provisions</strong></p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines, these Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Whirlwind FX and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Whirlwind FX and you in relation to the access to and use of the SignalRGB Platform.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Whirlwind FX as a result of this Agreement or your use of the SignalRGB Platform.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.5 Whirlwind FX's failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.6 You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without Whirlwind FX's prior written consent. Whirlwind FX may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.7 Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this Agreement, will be in writing and given by Whirlwind FX via email, SignalRGB Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS and social media applications).</p>
<p class="astro-Y5PY4VQC">15.8 If you have any questions about these Terms please email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3a494f4a4a55484e7a4d525348564d53545e5c4214595557">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
