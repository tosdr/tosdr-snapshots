<h3 id="2.-account%2C-password%2C-security%2C-and-phone-use" tabindex="-1">2. Account, Password, Security, and Phone Use</h3>

You are the sole authorized user of your Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login and password provided by you or given to you by Manychat for accessing the Services. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Account, even if not authorized by you.  Users are responsible for the content users upload to their Account and use of any user’s Account, and Manychat expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password or Account or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to contact Manychat immediately.</p>
<p>The person signing up for the Services will be the contracting party (“<strong>Account Representative</strong>”) for the purposes of these Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding Account we provide to the Account Representative in connection with the Services; provided, however, that if you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, your employer shall be the Account Representative. As the Account Representative, you are solely responsible for complying with these Terms of Service and only you are entitled to all benefits accruing thereto.

<p>Each Trial provides access to the Services at the price advertised (if any) for an initial, introductory period (the “<strong>Trial Period</strong>”) beginning at the moment you confirm your acceptance of the Trial by submitting valid payment details that are accepted by us.

<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND Manychat CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND Manychat TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p>
<p>You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to your use of the Services, you will contact us by submitting your dispute or claim via <a href="https://manychat.com/support">www.manychat.com/support</a>, and you and Manychat will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for 30 days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery), such matter will be deemed a “Dispute” as defined below.  Except for the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief described under the “Binding Arbitration” section below, should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you may have been entitled to them otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> You and Manychat agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to your use of the Services (collectively “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. <strong>This means that you and Manychat both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a claim against Manychat in “small claims” court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> You and Manychat agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. <strong>This means that you and Manychat both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and Manychat agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of class action proceeding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Administration and Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution’ section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless you and Manychat agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed USD$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Manychat submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing, and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds USD$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision and Governing Law.</strong> The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the “Disclaimer of Warranties” section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>
<p><strong>Fees.</strong> Each party’s responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and are set forth in the AAA Rules.</p>
