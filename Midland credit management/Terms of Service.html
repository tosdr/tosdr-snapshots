<li><strong>11. PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</strong> These Payment Terms and Conditions (the “Payment Terms and Conditions”) are part of this TOU and govern any payment transaction you initiate on the MCM Website (each, a “Payment Transaction”). If you choose to use the MCM Website to make a Payment Transaction, you accept and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions.
<ul class="add-list-top">
<li><strong>11.1  Scope:</strong> As used herein, the words “bank account” refer to the account held by a bank, securities firm, or other financial institution from which payment will be made when you make a Payment Transaction. The words “your bank” mean the bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that holds your account and/or issued your credit or debit card. Making a Payment Transaction will enable you to pay your account(s) online. MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service, and specific payment methods, to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time.</li>
<li><strong>11.2  Payment Authorization (Including Automatic Payments):</strong> To make a Payment Transaction, including automatic payments (if eligible), you must designate a valid major credit card, check, or electronic check (“Payment Method”). Each time you initiate a Payment Transaction, you authorize us or our agent to draw a check or draft, initiate an automated clearing house (“ACH”) debit, and/or charge your Payment Method, in your name to the bank account you specify, payable to us or to our agent, in the amount of the Payment Transaction, on the date(s) specified (&#8220;Billing Date&#8221;) of the month(s) of payment according to the schedule (one-time or recurring) that you have affirmatively elected to enroll in for your account. Your transaction must be payable in U.S. dollars. By paying using your designated Payment Method, you agree that: (a) you have read, understand and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions, and that this agreement constitutes a &#8220;writing signed by you&#8221; under any applicable law or regulation; (b) you consent to the electronic delivery of the disclosures contained in these Terms and Conditions; (c) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to make any inquiries or take any other action we consider necessary to validate your bank account or any dispute involving your payment, which may include engaging with third-party account validation providers to validate your bank account, ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide against third party databases; (d) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to initiate one or more drafts or ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account; and (e) you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments, debit your debit card, and/or charge your credit card, and to initiate any debit or credit entries to your bank account in the amount of such payments or corrections.</li>
<li><strong>11.3  Charges:</strong> Before you make your payment, make sure you have enough money in your bank account to cover the payment. For each transaction, your bank may assess its customary per-check or item-handling charge, if any. Your bank may also assess its customary charge for each dishonored check or draft. If any transaction (check, demand, draft, debit, or charge debited or drawn by us or our agent in connection with your Payment Transaction) is not honored by your bank, we have the right to collect the amount from you as permitted by applicable law. If this happens, we may cancel your right to make Payment Transactions on the MCM Website.<br />
<span class="paragraph-spacer">For certain accounts, you may have a separate agreement with a participating bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that allows a line of credit to be accessed in the event that your account contains insufficient funds to make payment to us. You should refer to the appropriate agreement relating to that line of credit for the terms and conditions that govern its use.</span></li>
<li><strong>11.4  Payment:</strong> Any request or order to settle or make a Payment Transaction shall require MCM’s confirmation of acceptance, and may also require additional verification or information from a third-party account verification provider and additional verification or information from you before acceptance by MCM. All amounts are denoted in US Dollars ($). MCM utilizes third party payment processors, and you hereby agree that MCM may charge your chosen payment method for any Payment Transaction and for any applicable taxes. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you in connection with any credit card, debit card, or other payment method utilized in connection with a Payment Transaction with MCM. MCM does not assess fees or interest to a consumer’s balance throughout the period of active repayment (except those awarded by a court upon agreement with the consumer or after due process of law); however, missed payments will invalidate any agreed upon arrangement. Interest on the account, if applicable, which had been deferred while payments were being received may be added back to the account after payments ceased. MCM also reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the MCM Website if you fail to pay any amounts when due. You shall reimburse MCM for all reasonable costs incurred (including reasonable attorney’s fees) in collecting past-due amounts.</li>
<li><strong>11.5  Third-Party Processors:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any third party payment processor’s terms and conditions and may be required to establish an account with a third party payment service provider in order to complete a Payment Transaction. You may also be required to abide by additional instructions from and to agree to further terms and conditions with MCM regarding payment, retrieving data, and receiving other services. If there is a conflict between this TOU and such other or third party terms and conditions, this TOU shall control as it relates to the subject matter of this TOU.</li>
<li><strong>11.6  Current Information:</strong> It is your responsibility to make sure that your Payment Method information and contact information are current at all times during the term of the payment plan you specify in your Payment Transaction.</li>
<li><strong>11.7  Payment Processing for Online Payments:</strong> With limited exceptions, we will endeavor for Payment Transactions to be processed within 24 hours of receipt. Payment Transactions made at or before 2:00 pm PST may be credited to your account the same day. Payment Transactions made after 2:00 pm PST may be credited to your account the following business day. You are solely responsible for making payments sufficiently available prior to the due date, and you are solely responsible for actions taken on your account resulting from a late payment.</li>
<li><strong>11.8  Turning Off Automatic Payment or Voiding Your Plan:</strong> To cancel automatic payments on your payment plan, please contact us directly at the phone number at the bottom of the page. You may also void your plan by logging into your account located on the MCM Website, or by calling the same number. Such cancellation or termination shall be effective at the time of cancellation or termination. To cancel, change, or modify your payments or plan, please call or log-on at least two (2) Business Days before the Billing Date, unless otherwise permitted under applicable law, or your payment may be debited and/or charged for the then due payment. If you have entered into an agreement on a pending civil action regarding the underlying debt or a court has approved your payment plan and it, or the agreement itself, requires additional actions by either party in the event of your non-payment or default, then your cancellation of online automatic payments will be honored. However, this may not affect your legal rights or your obligations to pay as agreed. &#8220;Business Day&#8221; means Monday through Friday, excluding official U.S. government holidays and official MCM corporate holidays.<br />

<li><strong>11.9  Customer Service:</strong> Payment Transactions that we process using your Payment Method, will be identified as &#8220;Midland Credit Management, Inc.&#8221; (or similar identifier) on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution holding your account. All questions relating to any transactions made using your bank account by us should be initially directed to us.

You may also view your transaction history for your payment at any time in the Account Details screen.</li>
<li><strong>11.10  Transaction Errors and Advisability of Prompt Reporting:</strong> If you believe that any Payment Transaction initiated by MCM (or its agent) with respect to your bank account is erroneous, or if you need more information about any such transaction, you should contact us as soon as possible. Notify us at once if you believe the password associated with your account has been lost or stolen, or if someone has attempted (or may attempt) to make a transfer from your bank account to complete a payment using your account without your permission. We reserve the right to cancel the ability to pay using the MCM Website for any reason at any time. You also should contact your bank for the Payment Method.</li>
<li><strong>11.11  Our Liability for Improper Transactions or Payments:</strong> Federal law limits your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous unauthorized transaction from your bank account based on how quickly you report it to your financial institution. As general rule, you should report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank within 60 days after the questionable transaction FIRST appeared on your bank account statement. You should contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply to your account and any unauthorized transactions, including any limits on your liability. We will not be liable to you in the following instances:
<ul class="add-list-top">
<li class="nested-list-item">&#8211; If, through no fault of ours, your account does not contain enough money to complete the transaction;</li>
<li class="nested-list-item">&#8211; If the funds in your account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting the transaction; or</li>
<li class="nested-list-item">&#8211; If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>11.12  Disclosure of Payment Information to Third-Parties:</strong> To protect your privacy, we will not disclose any information about your online payment transactions to any person, except as follows:
<ul class="add-list-top">
<li class="nested-list-item">1. as necessary to complete transactions, including without limitation to validate any bank account with a third party account verification provider such as Bank of America’s U.S. Account Validation service using the National Shared Database, to verify the bank account prior to completion of certain web-based transactions;</li>
<li class="nested-list-item">2. to validate or verify the existence and condition any dispute involving payment, including with a third party, such as a financial institution or credit bureau (or, for Massachusetts residents, a consumer reporting agency as defined in chapter 93 of the Massachusetts General Laws);</li>
<li class="nested-list-item">3. to comply with government agency or court orders;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>11.13  Termination:</strong> MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time. You may terminate your participation in this service, but you must do so by writing to us at the address disclosed in the Section of these Payment Terms and Conditions entitled &#8220;Customer Service.&#8221; For automatic payments, see the section of these Payment Terms and Conditions entitled &#8220;Cancellation of Automatic Payments.&#8221; If you close your account, you agree to notify us first and to stop initiating transactions, and pay all agreed upon payments</li>
<li><strong>11.14  Prior Agreements and Assignments:</strong> These Payment Terms and Conditions terminate and take the place of all prior agreements you may have with us relating to any Payment Transactions. We have the right to assign these Payment Terms and Conditions to a subsidiary or affiliate company at any time.</li>
<li><strong>11.15  Note for Massachusetts Residents:</strong><br />

<span class="paragraph-spacer"><strong>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong> IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION <strong>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT YOU OR WE MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</span></li>
<li><strong>16. ENFORCEMENT:</strong> MCM wishes to maintain the MCM Website as helpful resources for all of its users. As it relates to MCM, MCM reserves the right to view, monitor, and/or record activity on the MCM Website (in accordance with applicable law) and to comply with government or court appointed authorities when necessary. Actual or attempted unauthorized use of the MCM Website may also result in criminal and/or civil prosecution, including, without limitation, punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 under U.S. federal law. You shall therefore not, nor shall you permit any third party to, disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure established by MCM for use of or with the MCM Website. Moreover, you also acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this TOU by you may cause irreparable injury to MCM and/or its licensors, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and MCM and/or its licensors would not have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that MCM and/or its licensors (or on their behalf) shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this TOU. Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that MCM or its licensors post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to MCM to enforce any provision of this TOU.</li>
<li><strong>17. TERMINATION:</strong> MCM also reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraud, illegal activity, or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOU, to terminate this TOU with you (including any registered account) and your right to access and use the MCM Website. You acknowledge and agree that MCM shall have the sole right to determine in its reasonable discretion whether you are engaging in any unauthorized activity and/or violating any term or conditions of this TOU. MCM shall also not be responsible or liable for any damages or loss, such as loss of sales or profits, as a result of any termination of this TOU in accordance with this section. You may also terminate at any time by ceasing to use the MCM Website. But, all applicable provisions of this TOU will survive termination, as outlined below. Any licenses from MCM and any right to use the MCM Website shall immediately cease upon termination of this TOU. The provisions concerning feedback, MCM&#8217;s ownership rights, warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, governing law, enforcement, termination, and the miscellaneous terms will survive the termination or expiration of this TOU for any reason.</li>
<li><strong>18. GOVERNING LAW:</strong> This TOU has been made in and will be construed and enforced solely in accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of California. Without limiting and subject to the arbitration provisions set forth in this TOU, the state or local courts in the State of California will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all controversies in connection with this TOU, and you hereby consent to such exclusive and personal jurisdiction and venue. Any claim you might have against MCM relating to performance under this TOU must be brought within two (2) years after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. In addition, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this TOU and that each party has the right to seek attorney&#8217;s fees in any proceeding. You also acknowledge and agree that any applicable state law implementation of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (including any available remedies or laws) shall not apply to this TOU and is hereby disclaimed.</li>
<li><strong>19. SPECIFIC PROGRAMS; OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</strong> Additional notices, terms, and conditions, including, without limitation, MCM’s Web Privacy Policy, and MCM&#8217;s Privacy Notice, may apply to the use of the platforms or online solutions available through the MCM Website. You agree to abide by such other notices, terms, and conditions (as applicable). If there is a conflict with this Agreement, MCM&#8217;s obligations, if any, with respect to its services, programs, and/or products are governed solely by the terms, conditions, notices, and agreements pursuant to which they are provided, and nothing should be construed to alter such terms, conditions, notices, and agreements. Nevertheless, your end use of the MCM Website shall be pursuant to this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>20. ENGLISH VERSION PREVAILS:</strong> In the event this TOU is translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English language version shall prevail.</li>
<li><strong>21. MISCELLANEOUS:</strong> The relationship between you and MCM is and shall be that of independent contractors and nothing in this TOU shall be construed or used to create or imply any relationship of partners, joint ventures, or employer and employee. You may not assign or otherwise transfer this TOU or the license granted hereunder or delegate any of your duties specified herein, in whole or in part, without MCM&#8217;s prior written consent. Any attempt of assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this TOU shall be void, of no effect, and a material breach of this TOU. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MCM may assign this TOU in whole or in part. Moreover, MCM may delegate its rights and responsibilities or use contractors or agents to fulfill its obligations under this TOU. Failure by MCM to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of that or any subsequent default or failure of performance. In the event any provision of this TOU is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of this TOU, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of this TOU nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision. Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This TOU and MCM&#8217;s Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein, represent the entire agreement between you and MCM with respect to subject matter herein, and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between you and MCM with respect to the MCM Website. Please note that MCM reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this TOU and by which the MCM Website are extended to you by providing notice of such changes on this webpage or providing in writing or electronically a copy of such revised terms (or notice thereof). MCM also has the exclusive right to provide updates, upgrades, and/or changes to any aspect of the MCM Website at any time. Your continued use of the MCM Website following any such change will be deemed acceptance of any change to this TOU or the MCM Website.</li>
