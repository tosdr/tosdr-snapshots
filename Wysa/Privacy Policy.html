<p style="font-size: 24px;line-height: 28px;">What data do we process when you use the Wysa Digital Front Door Service?</p>
<p>
Wysa Digital front door application allows your Institution to triage you and your dependents to authorised care and support resources. The service redirects you to authorised support resources based on your pronouns, country, service group, language choice, support choice and self-reported mood assessments. Support resources include the Institution’s EAP, the Wysa App and other Institution provided services. Access to the Wysa front door service will be via your Institution provided Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism. Where required and on behalf of your Institution, we may integrate our App and Services with your Institution’s authentication mechanism such as Single Sign On (SSO). SSO enables you to use your Institution credentials to sign-in and access authorised Wysa App and Services and other third-party services. Wysa App will redirect you to your Institution’s SSO web page during your first access. The SSO processing is done by your Institution to verify your identity and direct you to the Wysa App. Your personal information, submitted during sign-in, is not transferred or stored in the Wysa system. Wysa will receive a one-time unique and encrypted identifier, which will be used to generate a random user identifier to associate you to the App and Services. Wysa will keep track of your login status and inform your Institution of any change to allow your Institution to manage future SSO requests. If you have any questions about your use of SSO please contact your Institution directly. No personal data is collected or processed during your use of the Wysa digital front door application and service. Wysa shall share population-level and aggregated analytics on App engagement and use with your Institution. You can delete your data at any time by selecting the “Reset my data” option available within the App.

We will maintain appropriate agreements with your Institution before any data processing or sharing.
</p>
<p>
We will also generate reports for your Institution. Only aggregated and anonymised data, at a population or cohort level, will be used for the Institution’s reporting needs. These reports will be generated and shared with your Institution as downloadable files via secure analytic dashboards. Your individual insights will never be shared with your Institution without your consent.
</p>
<p>
We may provide anonymised or agreed upon minimal user level data with some of our Institutions. This would be for provisioning of Services and/or where it helps the Institutions provide better care for you.

We adhere to privacy by design principles and minimize and limit processing of any personal identifiers. We ensure compliance to US HIPAA by enforcing administrative, organisational and technical controls to safeguard the privacy and security of any health data that we may process

<div id="aiChatbot" class="detail">
<p class="text">
<p style="font-size: 24px;line-height: 28px;">How does the Artificial Intelligence chatbot work and is it safe to use?</p>
<p>
At Wysa, we use proprietary Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU) algorithms (“AI”) to understand your messages.
NLP/NLU algorithms are classification techniques that are used to understand what you write. This allows the AI to maintain a conversation with you and guide you to appropriate resources. Our values require that our AI used within the App is transparent, trusted, safe and privacy protecting. All the AI used in our Apps are “FIXED” or “CLOSED”, and all chatbot responses to the user are created with clinical input and subjected to detailed safety testing before being deployed. There are no generative (those that 'create' the response to the user on the fly) or adaptive models (i.e. those that continually adapt or learn every time on their own) in use. The algorithms run at conversational nodes within a decision-tree structure.
</p>
<p>
The primary purpose of the AI-based processing is
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
to provide an interactive safe-by-design approach to converse and journal via text with the chatbot.
</li>
<li>
to detect and retain limited context from your messages to personalize and provide empathetic and safe conversations.
</li>
<li>
to detect at-risk situations, such as any SOS, self-harm and abuse triggers, so as to signpost users to clinically validated supportive resources and helplines.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Wysa complies with UK NHS Digital’s DCB 0129 clinical risk management standards to ensure a safe-by-design approach to our AI-based services.

<div id="generativeAI" class="detail">
<p class="text">
<p style="font-size: 24px;line-height: 28px;">How do we use Generative AI technology?</p>
<p>
We use third-party Generative AI technology services for generating static, quality and clinically verified content scripts that provide a high performing, safe and improved user experience with our AI based Services. No personal data gets shared with these third-party services.
</p>
<p>
Generated content needs to pass our safety and quality guardrails before being accepted for use. All generated content scripts are rigorously quality checked for copyright and plagiarism, clinically validated using a therapist-in-the-loop for safety, privacy, quality and performance. Only validated content gets released within our App and Services. We will transparently inform you when we use Generative AI based features within the App.

Where applicable, We will provide additional Terms of Use and Privacy notices to transparently keep you informed about any generative AI based data processing.

<p style="font-size: 24px;line-height: 28px;">How long do we retain your data including personal data?</p>
<p>
We have built proprietary algorithms that detect personal identifiers, that you may voluntarily submit in English during your conversation with AI Coach. These detected identifiers get irreversibly removed within 24 hours within our system.
</p>
<p>
We may retain one copy of your data even after your subscription ends or Institution contract ends if it is reasonably necessary. This could be in any of the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
to comply with applicable legal and statutory requirements;
</li>
<li>
at the request of a returning subscriber;
</li>
<li>
to respond to your requests
</li>
<li>
based on contractual obligations with your Institution;
</li>
<li>
in our backup for a time-bound period;
</li>
<li>
to fulfill processing that is in our legitimate interest.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Where not specified we retain your data for a maximum of 10 years since the last update and as per our internal information retention policies.
</p>
<p>
Your emergency contact information, if any provided, will be deleted after fifteen (15) days at the end of the Wysa emotional well-being professional subscription. If you renew the subscription within those fifteen (15) days, the emergency contact information will not be deleted.

</li>
<li>

</ul>
