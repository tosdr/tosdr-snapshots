WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY OR WHEN YOUR USAGE REACHES A THRESHOLD) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.

The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined<!-- --> <span>Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.

YOU AND RAILWAY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Railway are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.

If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Railway to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Railway agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts<!-- --> <span>located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.</span></p><p class="leading-7 mb-6"><span>(h) <em>Severability</em>.

This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Railway.</span></p><p class="leading-7 mb-6"><em><u>Miscellaneous</u></em>. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Railway may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.<!-- --> <span>The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Railway agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Railway, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Railway, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Railway in any respect whatsoever.</span></p><p class="leading-7 mb-6"><span>Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Railway agree there are no third-party
