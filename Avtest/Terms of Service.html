Any contractual and legal deadlines shall be delayed accordingly. Possibly resulting additional work or other costs incurred through delayed or not provided co-operation may be invoiced by AV-TEST separately.</p><h5>5 Change Requests</h5><p class="indent"><strong>5.1</strong>&nbsp; Each of the parties shall be entitled to request in writing changes to the Contractual Services.

Customer shall examine the offer for realization without delay after submission by AV-TEST.</p><p class="indent"><strong>5.3</strong>&nbsp; Changes in services shall be documented in writing by a corresponding adaptation of the agreement.

In this case AV-TEST shall notify Customer of the discontinuation of further Contractual Services with fourteen (14) days' notice. The rights of AV-TEST regulated herein shall apply irrespective of further contractually agreed or legal rights and entitlements of AV-TEST, including enforcement of damage caused by delay.</p><h5>8 Deficiencies in the Quality of the Services</h5><p class="indent"><strong>8.1</strong>&nbsp; Customer shall inform AV-TEST immediately in written or electronic form if he notices that a Contractual Service does not comply with the agreement. This shall be done in such way, that the provision of services contrary to the agreement notified to AV-TEST shall be specified in as much detail as possible.</p><p class="indent"><strong>8.2</strong>&nbsp; In as far as AV-TEST is responsible for the service contrary to the agreement and Customer has complied with his obligation to information according to Paragraph 8.1, AV-TEST shall be entitled at first to render the Contractual Service in question without additional cost to Customer within an appropriate period and in compliance with the agreement, in as far as performance of the service is possible and expedient.</p><p class="indent"><strong>8.3</strong>&nbsp; In as far as subsequent performance of the Contractual Service is impossible or is not successful in essential parts for reasons AV-TEST is to be held responsible for within the reasonable period of grace fixed by Customer, Customer shall be entitled to terminate the respective individual agreement without notice for an important reason. In this case AV-TEST shall be entitled to remuneration for the services rendered on the basis of the individual agreement up to the effectiveness of the termination.</p><p class="indent"><strong>8.4</strong>&nbsp; Further entitlements due to deficiencies in the quality of the Contractual Services shall be excluded. The right to enforce damage claims within the framework of Paragraph 9 remains unaffected.</p><h5>9 Liability</h5><p class="indent"><strong>9.1</strong>&nbsp; Subject to the regulation in Paragraph 9.2 AV-TEST is liable for damages due to any legal basis for amounts corresponding to the following provisions:</p><p class="indent-double"><strong>a.</strong> Liability of AV-TEST for damages which are caused by AV-TEST intentionally or by gross negligence shall be unlimited by their amounts;</p><p class="indent-double"><strong>b.</strong> AV-TEST shall bear limited liability as to the amount in case of foreseeable, typical damages occurring due to violation of essential duties under contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) by slight negligence. The term “cardinal obligation” signifies such duties in an abstract manner, the fulfilment of which shall permit orderly execution of the agreement in the first place and the compliance with which the contractual partner must be able to trust at any time;</p><p class="indent-double"><strong>c.</strong> Any further liability for damage claims shall be excluded, in particular liability for the violation of non-cardinal obligations by slight negligence or liability independent of negligence.</p><p class="indent"><strong>9.2</strong>&nbsp; The above liability limitation shall not apply in cases of mandatory statutory liability as well as on assumption of a guarantee or of culpably caused physical injury.</p><p class="indent"><strong>9.3</strong>&nbsp; Customer shall be obliged to implement appropriate measures for the prevention and minimization of damages.

Paragraph 14.3 shall remain unaffected.</p><p class="indent"><strong>14.5</strong>&nbsp; Confidential Information must not be disclosed to third parties by the receiving party without prior written agreement of the other party, unless</p><p class="indent-double"><strong>a.</strong> this is required by statutory legal requirement or by court order or by order of an authority and the receiving party has informed the other party without delay in writing concerning its respective obligation and has allowed the other party the possibility to take action against the disclosure.</p><p class="indent-double"><strong>b.</strong> the confidential information is made available to the consultants of the receiving party in context with the execution of the individual contract and the consultant has first given the receiving party his commitment to secrecy in writing or if he is already bound by law to a professional obligation to maintain confidentiality.</p><p class="indent"><strong>14.6</strong>&nbsp; Unless deviating agreement has been reached in the respective individual agreement the Performance Results handed over by AV-TEST to Customer shall be deemed Confidential Information of AV-TEST until released by AV-TEST and must not be published and/or made accessible to third parties in any other way.</p><p class="indent"><strong>14.7</strong>&nbsp; Upon termination of the agreement both parties shall return the Confidential Information received from the other party or they shall destroy it in an appropriate way.
