<strong>General Terms</strong>

<strong>Protect Private Info Service</strong>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">If purchased, the Protect Private Info Service will regularly use your Information to scan online data source websites (the "Data Sites") for personal information about you. Sometimes these websites are called people search sites. If online personal information about you is identified at these Data Sites, we will submit opt-out requests on your behalf to remove it ("Opt-out"). You can go to the BrandYourself site at any time to see if online personal information about you was found at these websites and whether the opt-out was successful. </p>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">We may change the Data Sites that are being scanned at any time without notice to you.</p>
</li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t">
<strong>Limited Authority to Act on Your Behalf</strong>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">In order to submit an Opt-out request to remove your information from Data Sites, we may need to interact with Data Sites on your behalf. You expressly authorize BrandYourself, its agents, servicers, and its employees, to act as your personal representative in order to submit Opt-out requests to Data Sites and:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha m-20-l">
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t">obtain information on your behalf;</li>

<strong>No Guarantee</strong>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">BrandYourself does not guarantee that the Service will find a user’s online personal information at any of the Data Sites, or that it will scan all Data Sites if a user’s online personal information is not present. We do not guarantee that the Service will be effective, that an Opt-out request will be honored or responded to, or that all Opt-out requests for a user’s online personal information will be equivalent. We do not guarantee that an Opt-out request will prevent all or any future uses or disclosures of a user’s online personal information by a Data Site, that we will identify all instances of a user’s online personal information that are eligible for Opt-out, or that the Data Sites will not retain copies of a user’s online personal information.</p>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">Some of the Data Sites may have multiple databases and may acquire and aggregate personal information about individuals on an ongoing basis. The Opt-out request we submit on your behalf may not be effective for all sources of online personal information maintained by the Data Site, or for online personal information acquired by the Data Site after we submit the Opt-out request. In addition, BrandYourself may not locate all entries or the correct entries of your online personal information that are eligible for Opt-out. Not all of these Data Sites offer the same type of Opt-out options. Further, in some instances, even if we are able to effectively submit an Opt-out request on your behalf to a Data Site, that Data Site may still maintain your online personal information in its records. In other instances, a Data Site may fail to honor or properly respond to an Opt-out request.</p>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">You understand and agree that BrandYourself is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any of these Data Sites, and that BrandYourself makes no representations, warranties or guarantees related to such Data Sites. You expressly agree that BrandYourself will not be liable to you under any circumstances for any actions or inactions of these Data Sites, or for our failure for any reason to exercise effective Opt-outs on your behalf. You understand and agree that BrandYourself is not a credit repair organization as defined under federal or state law, including the Credit Repair Organizations Act.</p>
