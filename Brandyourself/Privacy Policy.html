<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">Protecting Consumer Privacy is a core tenet of our mission at BrandYourself. We believe consumers should be able to enjoy the web without worrying about their privacy, safety or security.</p>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">For BrandYourself, that means not only building tools to help consumers protect their privacy against other companies, but also considering your privacy in every decision we make internally. We consider privacy in every decision we make from structuring our own business model to designing our technology. We also strive to offer transparency in everything we do.</p>
<p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b">While privacy policies are inevitably dense and filled with legalese, we wanted to pull out a few important elements that form the backbone of how our policy operates.</p>
<ol>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>You are not the product:</strong> BrandYourself never sells or monetizes your data to a third party. Period. Our business model has alway been simple. We charge a subscription fee for our premium products/services. We made a decision early on to never use the data of our users to build or grow another revenue stream, especially one our users can’t see. Since we do not monetize our data, there is no incentive to build rich data profiles on our users or abuse your data in anyway. Our goal is to protect your data, not give it away.</p></li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>We protect your data at all costs:</strong> BrandYourself takes every precaution to limit the data we do have on users and to keep that data as secure as possible. While in an ideal world we could limit that data to zero, we need some data for our product to actually function and provide you with value. For example, we need to scan your social media posts for our “clean up social media” feature to work. That said, we only use/store data deemed absolutely necessary for a function to work for only as long as we need it to fulfill those functions. Here are some of the measures we take to safeguard your data:</p>
<ol>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>Technical measures:</strong> Any information we store is transmitted in AES 256-bit end-to-end encryption format using SSL technology, and is deleted once it is no longer needed. We use up-to-date software and operating systems and firewall protection.</p></li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>Administrative measures:</strong> Access to your PII is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to access it based on their job descriptions. These personnel are properly vetted, background checked and trained and given only as much access control as necessary to do their jobs.</p></li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>Physical Measures:</strong> All servers are kept in a secure location. Access to PII is not permitted via the Internet except using an encrypted virtual private network.</p></li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>Cookies:</strong> We strive to use only the absolute minimum amount of cookies required to make your experience seamless. For example, while many sites store lots of unnecessary cookies that track behavior, we only store ones that are critical to your experience, such as ones that allow you to return to BrandYourself without having to log-in every single time. And if you ever want to clear your cookies (from or BrandYourself or from any other company), <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-how-to-clear-cookies.html">here’s how to do it</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="m-20-b m-20-t"><p class="m-20-l m-20-t p-0-b"><strong>YOU are in control:</strong> You always have the right to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e7c1c4d6d6d2dcc1c4d6d6d0dcc1c4d6d6d5dcc1c4d6d6d5dcc1c4d6d6d6dcc1c4d6d6d3dcc1c4d6d6d1dcc1c4d1d3dcc1c4dedfdcc1c4d6d6d3dcc1c4ded0dcc1c4d6d6d7dcc1c4d6d7d7dcc1c4d6d5d6dcc1c4d6d6d6dcc1c4d6d6d0dcc1c4d6d6d3dcc1c4d6d6d2dcc1c4d6d7d6dcc1c4d6d7dfdcc1c4d6d7d5dcc1c4d3d1dcc1c4dededcc1c4d6d6d6dcc1c4d6d7dedc">request what information</a> we have about you, <a href="/account-settings">opt out of any marketing messaging</a> in your account settings, or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4e2e7f5f5f1ffe2e7f5f5f3ffe2e7f5f5f6ffe2e7f5f5f6ffe2e7f5f5f5ffe2e7f5f5f0ffe2e7f5f5f2ffe2e7f2f0ffe2e7fdfcffe2e7f5f5f0ffe2e7fdf3ffe2e7f5f5f4ffe2e7f5f4f4ffe2e7f5f6f5ffe2e7f5f5f5ffe2e7f5f5f3ffe2e7f5f5f0ffe2e7f5f5f1ffe2e7f5f4f5ffe2e7f5f4fcffe2e7f5f4f6ffe2e7f0f2ffe2e7fdfdffe2e7f5f5f5ffe2e7f5f4fdff">delete your account</a>.
