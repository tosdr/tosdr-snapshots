The inclusion of any link does not imply affiliation, endorsement, or adoption by CCC of the site or any information contained therein. You should review third parties' terms of use and privacy policies before you use their services. </p>

      <p>14.2 Your transactions and other dealings with third party merchants or advertisers that are found on or through the Services, including "click to purchase", "co-registration" and other similar programs, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, are solely between you and such merchant or advertiser.</p>
      <p>15. TERMINATION</p>

      <p>15.1 We may, at any time, without notice to you, terminate your license to use the Services and the Site, or block your access to the Services if:</p>
      (i) we believe in our sole discretion that you may have violated these Terms or have otherwise engaged in any activities that may harm or damage the reputation, rights, person, or property of CCC, our users, or any other person;
      (ii) requested by law enforcement or other government agencies.

      <p>15.2 If applicable law requires us to provide notice of termination or cancellation, we may give prior or subsequent notice by posting it on the Site or by sending a communication to your email address that we have for you in our records.</p>
      <p>16. SEVERABILITY</p>

      <p>16.1 If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
      <p>17. NO WAIVER</p>

      <p>17.1 The failure of any party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms, including any failure to act with respect to a breach, will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or that party's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We suggest that you print out a copy of these Terms for your records.</p>
      <p>18. HEADINGS</p>

      <p>18.1 Section headings are included in the Terms for convenience only. They are not to be considered a part of these Terms, and are not intended to be a full and accurate description of the contents hereof.</p>

      <p>19. PAID PLANS</p>
      <p>When you purchase a CCC premium subscription, you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and that payments will be made to Casting Call Club LLC by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for CCC is terminated by you or by CCC.</p>

      <p>If your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") is declined for payment of your subscription, you must provide new Payment Information or your subscription will be canceled. If you provide new Payment Information and are successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. You may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period and the cancellation will take effect on the next billing period. Your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.</p>

      <p>UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION.</p>

      <p>20. VIRTUAL GOODS</p>
      <p>CCC does not guarantee that the Virtual Goods will continually be offered, including cccCoins or awards such as Silver, Gold or Bronze or for any particular length of time. CCC may modify its Virtual Goods at its sole discretion, and such modifications may make some or all Virtual Goods more or less common, desirable, effective, or functional. CCC may immediately suspend or terminate Virtual Goods for any or no reason, in its sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. The number of Virtual Goods required to use other Virtual Goods (e.g., cccCoins needed to award another user) may be increased or decreased, any Virtual Good may be withdrawn, and restrictions on any Virtual Good redemption may be imposed at any time, even though such changes may affect the value or utility of the Virtual Good, or the ability to obtain certain Virtual Goods. In accumulating Virtual Goods, users may not rely upon the continued availability of any Virtual Goods.</p>

      <p>Virtual Goods have no monetary value (i.e., are not a cash account or equivalent), and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Goods cannot be sold to other users, and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services. Users have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in promotional or purchased Virtual Goods, which remain CCC digital content subject to the CCC’s User Agreement. Virtual Goods are non-refundable. Virtual Goods awarded to other users will not be returned (e.g., if you award another user, you cannot take that award back). You may not sell, barter, or trade any Virtual Goods, or offer to sell or trade any Virtual Goods. Any such attempted transfer will be null and void.</p>

      <p>21. ADULT CONTENT</p>
      <p>No pornographic content of any kind. Sorry. We kept getting legal notices.</p>
