</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our Services continue to grow and change. Please refer to our Site for further information about the Services we provide.
</p>
<h3>1.2. Limitations of our Services</h3>
<p>
We offer Services to help our users find dental professionals and dental opportunities in their communities. However, except where specifically provided in these Terms, in any applicable Additional Terms, or on the Site itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>We do not employ any Candidates and are not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Client, Candidate, or other user of the Site or Services.</b>
Clients are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable Ban-the-Box, Fair Chance, payroll, tax and minimum wage laws).
</p>
<p>
<b>Client and Candidate content is primarily user generated. We do not control or vet user-generated content for accuracy, and we do not assume and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Candidates or Clients on or off the Site. We do not assume and expressly disclaim any liability that may result from the use of information provided on our Site.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>We do not refer or recommend Clients or Candidates nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the services provided by Candidates or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Clients or Candidates whether in public, private or offline interactions. Any screening of a Client or Candidate and his, her or its information by Princess Dental Staffing is limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the individual’s or entity’s suitability as an Client or Candidate.</b>
</p>
<p>
We are not an employment agency, and we do not secure or procure employees for any Clients, nor do we secure or procure opportunities for employment for any Candidates.
</p>
<p>
We do not control, monitor, supervise, or oversee the quality, timing, hours, pay, legality, or any other aspect of services delivered by Candidates, nor do we require Candidates to accept or work any jobs or deliver any services at all.
</p>
<p>
We do not provide any medical, dental, diagnostic, treatment or clinical service or engage in any conduct that requires a professional license.
</p>
<p>
We may offer certain Registered Users the opportunity to verify certain information such as their email address, cell phone number, or, in the case of licensed dental professionals, their state license information. If we indicate that certain information has been verified, it means that the user has complied with the process we have established for verifying such information. However, we do not guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant, that the information is accurate or that it belongs to the Registered User who supplied it.
</p>
<p>
Candidates who opt to voluntarily provide information regarding their vaccination status agree that we may share this information with Clients and/or other Users of the site. Furthermore, vaccination status is user generated and we do not control or vet this user generated content. We do not guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant as to, the accuracy of such information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please review carefully the Release of Liability Form Third-Party Content and Conduct that appears in Section 9 below for important limitations on Princess Dental Staffing’s liability to which you are agreeing by using the Site and Services.</b>
</p>
<h3>1.3. User Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
<b>Registered Users are solely responsible for interviewing, vetting, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate Client or Candidate for themselves.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Each Client is responsible for complying with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish, including verifying the age of the Candidate they select as well as that Candidate’s eligibility to work in the US. Conformity to payroll laws, tax and minimum wage laws, worker’s compensation laws, liability insurance requirements, etc. are all the responsibility of the Client.</b>
</p>
<p>
If employment relationships are established, clients are responsible for paying Candidates upon completion of work. Individual Candidate pay rates vary and are displayed in the Candidate’s profile. Payment should be issued at the end of the completed shift, or as allowable by law. A maximum of 10 business days after work is completed is permitted for check processing and delivery.
</p>
<p>
For all Temporary assignments there is a 4-hour minimum. Once the Candidate arrives on time at the location for a scheduled temporary shift, unless cancelled online within a reasonable amount of time prior, 4 hours of pay is due. If a Candidate fails to meet the temporary job eligibility requirements as posted, Princess Dental Staffing is to be notified immediately. After a review, and with the consent of Princess Dental Staffing, Candidates who accept assignments that they are not qualified for may not be entitled to the 4-hour minimum.
</p>
<p>
Candidate hours are not to be penalized due to patient no-shows, unfilled schedules, or events beyond their control unless mutually agreed upon by both the Client and the Candidate. If a Candidate is late for a temporary assignment, the assignment may be canceled by the Client without penalty. If an Employer is late in opening the facility by the start time of a temporary assignment, the Candidate may abandon the assignment without penalty. Users who do not uphold their responsibilities for temporary job assignments may be prohibited from continued participation in them.
</p>
<p>
Princess Dental Staffing does not advise nor determine appropriate tax classifications for Candidates providing services in Client offices. Clients compensating Candidates as independent contractors do so under their own jurisprudence and must follow federal and state guidelines defining such classification. Princess Dental Staffing does not collect any governmental or legal forms from Candidates. Clients are required to maintain their own records on Candidates that have earned wages during the year from the Client (W-4's and W-9's are not available through Princess Dental Staffing). It is Client's responsibility to attain and file any necessary documents to comply with applicable employment laws in their area.
</p>
<p>
Please see a qualified accountant or attorney for recommendations on how to make more informed hiring and employment decisions.

<h3>4.1 Princess Dental Staffing May Order and Use Background Screenings About You</h3>
<p>
By registering for and using the Site or Services as a Client or Candidate, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Princess Dental Staffing has the right, but not the obligation, to use a third-party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background screenings on you for the purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users (“Preliminary Membership Screens”), which may, in the case of certain Candidates, be deemed to be an employment purpose under the FCRA. Subject to certain additional disclosures and authorizations, if applicable to you as a Candidate, Princess Dental Staffing may order these screenings when you register with Princess Dental Staffing and thereafter in connection with your continued use of our Services and/or interaction with our Site (such as by contacting or communicating with other members, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).
</p>
<p>
These Preliminary Membership Screens may also regulated by FCRA, and the background reports resulting from these services may be considered “consumer reports” under FCRA.
</p>
<p>
You understand and agree that Princess Dental Staffing may review the information provided by the third-party consumer reporting agency and that Princess Dental Staffing retains the right to terminate your Princess Dental Staffing registration based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently changed or corrected. If Princess Dental Staffing terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you access to a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Princess Dental Staffing does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it (and not Princess Dental Staffing) within the time period specified in your notice. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Princess Dental Staffing is under no obligation to reinstate any accounts it may have terminated even if the information that led to the termination is subsequently changed or corrected.
</p>
<p>
<b>
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND USING OUR SITE, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CANDIDATE, SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING TO PERFORM THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING.
</b>
</p>
<h3>4.2. Princess Dental Staffing May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and Warranties</h3>
<p>
By registering as a Candidate or Client, and, if applicable to you as a Candidate, subject to your additional authorization, you authorize Princess Dental Staffing, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Service, Princess Dental Staffing reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your registration data is accurate and that the representations and warranties in Section 2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also true (“Verification Checks”). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data.
</p>
<p>
You agree that Princess Dental Staffing may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation suspending and/or terminating your membership, should it determine that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of these Terms or are otherwise unsuitable for Princess Dental Staffing.
</p>
<p>
You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Princess Dental Staffing does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in a Verification Check. We do not typically communicate the results of a Verification Check to any third party, though we reserve the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes in accordance with applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
<b>
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CANDIDATE SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING TO PERFORM THE VERIFICATION CHECKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING.
</b>
</p>
<h3>4.3 Important Limitations About Background Checks; Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification Checks</h3>
<p>
<b>SPECIAL NOTICE FOR MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE:</b>
Criminal County Searches conducted in Massachusetts and New Hampshire as part of the Criminal Records Check and the Criminal+MVR Records Check (for individuals who are believed to have lived in one or both of these states during the seven years preceding the background check request) search only the Superior Court and a single District Court in the county seat or its equivalent for each county listed below. Criminal records (including misdemeanors and felonies) from other courts in these states will not be searched.
</p>
<p>
This is an illustrative, non-comprehensive, list of certain state and county limitations of the background checks offered through Princess Dental Staffing; additional limitations may apply in certain jurisdictions, including on the federal level. For example, for many states only certain registered sex offender information is reported, and for many states, only a subset of felony convictions are reported (and not any misdemeanors, charges or arrest records).
</p>
<p>
In addition to legal and reporting system limitations of background checks, each check is performed with the authorization of the person being checked, using information he or she provides, such as home address, social security number, date of birth, and name. If a candidate provides incorrect information, the check might be run with inaccurate identifying data, which can impact the validity of the criminal check. Finally, criminal records are not always reported accurately or promptly, and human and electronic error can result in inaccurate or incomplete reporting. Consequently, even the most comprehensive background check offered may not disclose the existence of all criminal records in all jurisdictions.
</p>
<p>
If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless Princess Dental Staffing from any loss, liability, injury, death, damage, or costs that may result from your use of, reliance on, or sharing of the information contained in a Background Check regardless of the cause, including, without limitation, due to the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.
</p>
<p>
You expressly acknowledge that Princess Dental Staffing has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users. To the extent Princess Dental Staffing performs such checks on certain Registered Users, the checks are limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those users have provided or of their eligibility to use the Services.
</p>
<h2>5. Termination</h2>
<p>
Princess Dental Staffing reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to all or part of the Princess Dental Staffing Site and/or Services, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your account with Princess Dental Staffing, with or without notice for any reason or no reason in its sole discretion, including without limitation if Princess Dental Staffing should determine that you are not eligible to use the Services, have violated any terms stated herein or in any of the Additional Terms, are not suitable for participation as a Registered User, have mis-used or mis-appropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a “mirrored,” competitive, or third-party site. Upon termination, Princess Dental Staffing shall be under no obligation to provide you with a copy of any content posted by or about you on the Site. If we terminate your registration, we have no obligation to notify you of the reason, if any, for your termination.
</p>
<p>

<h2>13. Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
<h3>13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
<p>
This Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement”. Unless you opt-out in accordance with the opt-out procedures set forth in Section 13.8 below, you agree that all claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise that have arisen or may arise between you and Princess Dental Staffing or a Princess Dental Staffing Affiliate, whether relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through
<b>final and binding arbitration, rather than a court,</b>
in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Your rights will be determined by a
<b>neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.</b>
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<h3>13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</h3>
<p>
<b>YOU AND PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AGAINST PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PRINCESS DENTAL STAFFING USERS.</b>
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
</p>
<h3>13.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>
Princess Dental Staffing is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us at Princess Dental Staffing, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 11445 E Via Linda, Ste 2-629, Scottsdale, AZ 85259.
</p>
<h3>13.4 Arbitration Procedures</h3>
<p>
If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved
<b>only by binding arbitration and not in courts of general jurisdiction.</b>
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (collectively referred to as the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and excluding the JAMS Class Action Procedures. For information on JAMS, please visit its website, https://www.jamsadr.com/. Information about JAMS’s Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the JAMS consumer arbitration page, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. If there is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
</p>
<p>
To commence an arbitration against Princess Dental Staffing, you must write a demand for arbitration that includes a description of the dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. You should send three copies of the Demand, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS at 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600, Orange, CA 92868, and send one copy to Princess Dental Staffing, Inc., 11445 E Via Linda, Ste 2-629, Scottsdale, AZ 85259. For more information, see the JAMS arbitration rules and forms, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.
</p>
<p>
The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or Princess Dental Staffing may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Princess Dental Staffing subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Princess Dental Staffing, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Princess Dental Staffing users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Princess Dental Staffing user to the extent required by applicable law.
</p>
<h3>13.5 Costs of Arbitration</h3>
<p>
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Princess Dental Staffing will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Princess Dental Staffing will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Princess Dental Staffing for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Princess Dental Staffing on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS rules.
</p>
<h3>13.6 Confidentiality</h3>
<p>
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
</p>
<h3>13.7 Opt-Out Procedure</h3>
<p>
You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new Princess Dental Staffing users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you use our Site or Services for the first time. If you are already a current Princess Dental Staffing user and previously accepted the Princess Dental Staffing Terms prior to the introduction of this Arbitration Agreement, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than January 17, 2017. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Princess Dental Staffing, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 11445 E Via Linda, Ste 2-629, Scottsdale, AZ 85259. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Princess Dental Staffing account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Princess Dental Staffing will likewise not be bound by these arbitration provisions. All other terms of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. Princess Dental Staffing users who accepted a previous version of these Terms that included an arbitration agreement, and who did not timely opt out of that arbitration agreement, remain bound by the last arbitration agreement that they accepted. Upon receipt of a valid Opt-Out Notice, Princess Dental Staffing will provide the opting out user with a copy of the arbitration agreement from the last version of the Terms that the user accepted, if any exists.
</p>
<h3>13.8 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, such change shall not be effective until at least 60 days from the date of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Princess Dental Staffing prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Princess Dental Staffing prior to the effective date of removal.
</p>
<h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
These Terms, and all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including Delaware’s statutes of limitations governing your claim, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>
Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Princess Dental Staffing must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware.
</p>
<p>
You and Princess Dental Staffing agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
</p>
<h2>15. Consent to Electronic Communication</h2>
<p>
By using the Site or Services of Princess Dental Staffing, you agree to allow Princess Dental Staffing to communicate with you electronically, and you consent to electronic delivery of notices, documents, or products (including, without limitation, reports or copies of Background Checks and Preliminary Membership Screens) from Princess Dental Staffing via the Princess Dental Staffing Site, mobile application, online messaging platform, or e-mail. You also agree to check your Princess Dental Staffing account, alerts, and messages, and the e-mail account reflected on your Princess Dental Staffing on a reasonably regular basis to stay apprised of important notices and information about your account.
</p>
<h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, Client, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. Each Affiliate (as defined in Section 1.2) is expressly made a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce this Agreement directly against you. This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
</p>
<h2>17. Severability</h2>
<p>
If a court decides that any term or provision of these Terms other than Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section 13.2 are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of Section 13 shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
</p>
