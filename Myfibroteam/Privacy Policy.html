    <h3 id="share">How We Share Your Personal Information</h3>

    <p><strong>With Other Members of the Social Network</strong></p>
    <p>
      Part of our mission is to make it easy for you to find and connect with other people facing the same health

      can be seen by the other registered members of the social network. When you provide posts, comments, or share
      other content members can see that information. Therefore, it is important that you only share information
      that you are comfortable having become public to other members of the network. Please note, you do not have to
      use your real name as your user ID and you do not have to share a photo of yourself if you do not wish to do so.

    <h3 id='store_information'>Where We Store the Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      Our Platform is hosted and operated in the U.S. and, as a result, the information you submit to us will

      laws where you reside. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and consent that any personal information

      We may transfer the personal data we collect about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy
      to countries that have not been found to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European
      Commission. In particular, we may transfer your personal data to third parties, including to parties
      located in the U.S. We use appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal information to third party

    <p>
      After you have deleted your account, we may store your information in an anonymous or aggregated form
      where that information would not identify you personally. In some cases, we retain your information as

    <h3>U.S. State Privacy Laws Addendum</h3>
    <p>
      This addendum applies to individuals who reside in states that have adopted consumer privacy laws. Because of
      differences in certain state laws, this supplement is broken into two sections, California (CCPA) Specific
      Notice, applicable to California residents only, and an Other State Specific Notice, applicable to residents
      of one or more states with consumer privacy laws requiring such information (collectively
      "<strong>U.S. State Privacy Laws</strong>"). 
    </p>

    <p><strong>A. California (CCPA) Specific Notices</strong></p>
    <p>
      This section applies to you only if you are a California resident. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as
      amended (CCPA) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information.
      For purposes of this section, references to "<strong>personal information</strong>" shall include
      "<strong>sensitive personal information</strong>," as these terms are defined under the CCPA.
    </p>

    <p class='text-underline'>Processing of Personal Information</p>
    <p>
      In the preceding 12 months, we collected and (where indicated below) disclosed for a business purpose the following
      categories of personal information and sensitive personal information (denoted by *) about California residents:
    </p>

    <p>
      The specific business or commercial purposes for which we collect your personal information and the categories
      of sources from which we collect your personal information are described in the
      "<a href='#use_personal_information'>How We Use Your Personal Information</a>" and
      "<a href='#information_about_you'>Information We Collect About You</a>" sections above. In addition, the
      criteria we use to determine how long to retain your personal information is described in the
      "<a href='#store_data'>How Long We Store Your Data</a>" section above.
    </p>

    <p class='text-underline'>Sale and Share of Personal Information</p>
    <p>
      The CCPA defines "sharing" to include disclosing or making available personal information to a third party for
      purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. We disclose your personal information with third parties (such
      as marketing and advertising networks and social platforms) for behavioral advertising or with other third party partners.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>MyHealthTeam does not disclose, sell, share, or rent your personal information to third parties in
      exchange for money. Further, we do not "sell" or "share" any personal information about individuals who we
      know are under the age of 16.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class='text-underline'>Additional Rights Under the CCPA</p>
    <p>
      In addition to the rights described in the "<a href='#privacy_rights'>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</a>"
      section, you may also have additional rights under the CCPA, regarding how your personal information is processed.
      However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Opt Out of Sharing of Personal Information</strong><br>
        You have a right to direct us not to "share" your personal information, as that term is defined under the
        CCPA. For information on how we process opt-out preference signals, see the section above,
        "<a href='#cookies'>Use of Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies</a>."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</strong><br>
        You have a right to direct us to limit our use and/or disclosure of sensitive personal information to only
        what is necessary to perform the Services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average resident.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nondiscrimination</strong><br>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You may exercise your rights by contacting us using the methods described in the
      "<a href="#exercising_rights">Exercising Your Rights</a>" section below.
    </p>

    <p><strong>B. Other U.S. State Specific Notice</strong></p>

    <p>
      The U.S. State Privacy Laws provides residents of certain states with specific rights regarding
      their personal information. In addition to the rights described in the
      "<a href='#privacy_rights'>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</a>" section, this section describes additional
      rights under the U.S. State Privacy Laws and how to exercise those rights.
    </p>

    <p class='text-underline'>Additional Rights Under the U.S. State Privacy Laws</p>

    <p>
      In addition to the rights described in the "<a href='#privacy_rights'>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</a>"
      section, depending on your state of residency, you also have additional rights under the U.S. State Privacy Laws:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising:</strong> You may have a right to direct us not to process or
        disclose your personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising. You may exercise your rights by
        contacting us using the methods described in the "<a href="#exercising_rights">Exercising Your Rights</a>" section below.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p id='exercising_rights'><strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong></p>
    <p>
      To exercise your rights described above, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@myhealthteam.com">privacy@myhealthteam.com</a>
      or send us a written request via mail at the address listed in this policy. Before we respond to your request,
      we will ask you to verify your identity. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information
      that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
      authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand,
      evaluate, and respond to it. Only you, or an authorized agent, may make a verifiable consumer request related
      to your personal information. We may request that your authorized agent have written permission from you to
      make requests on your behalf and may need to verify your authorized agent's identity. You may also make a
      verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>
    <p>
      We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more
      time (up to an additional 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you
      have an account with us, we will deliver our written response via email to that account. If you do not have
      an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically. The
      response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. If you are
      in a jurisdiction that recognizes your ability to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your
      attempt to assert a right under applicable US State Privacy Laws, you may file an appeal of our decision
      refusing your request to exercise your rights under this Privacy Notice.
