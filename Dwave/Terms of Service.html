<p>D-Wave will respond to clear notices of infringement consistent with Canadian law, and its response to such notices may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content, terminating the accounts of repeat infringers, and/or making good-faith attempts to contact the User who posted the content at issue so that the User may, where appropriate, take action to oppose any such notice.</p>

<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be indefinite, invalid, illegal or otherwise voidable or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will not fail on account thereof, and the balance of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. These Terms of Use (and any applicable EULA) constitute the entire agreement between you and D-Wave governing your use of the Website, Services, Materials and/or Software and supersede any prior agreements between you and D-Wave on such subject matter. You may also be subject to other terms and conditions when you access other websites or other portions of the Website, Services, Materials and/or Software (if specified) or if you access, download or purchase non-D-Wave Services or Materials. The failure or delay of D-Wave in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms of Use or elsewhere shall not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. You may not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use, or any right granted hereunder, without D-Wave's written consent. D-Wave's rights under these Terms of Use are freely transferable by D-Wave.
