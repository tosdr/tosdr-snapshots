<p>
<u><b>YOUR AGREEMENT WITH WEBMAGIC</b></u></p>
<p>
Welcome to WebMagic. By using WebMagic offerings, including its products, software, web sites, services

additional rules may be posted on those forums, and if so, are incorporated into these Terms of Use to the extent these forum rules
are not in conflict with these Terms of Use. <u>If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from
using or accessing this site.</u> By accepting this agreement, you agree that this Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy will
