WebMagic Privacy Policy
</h2>
<section>
<b>Updated: May 31, 2018</b>
<p>
<i>Note: Our privacy policy has been updated for the first time in several years. Effectively immediately, children under the age of 16 in Europe are not permitted to use our site (up from 14). For other regions, the minimal age had been lowered from 14 to 13. Other changes are fairly minor. We've added additional disclosure information in general -- particularly in regards to third party cookies and services, access to your own data, as well as further information on how we
handle people that we believe are intentionally trying to misuse our systems. We also added emphasis to the fact that information you upload to the site for public consumption (ie: message forums or comments added to pages or videos) can not often be deleted. In such cases, we can usually assist in removing content in these posts specifically referencing your real name or contact information (except in some extremely rare cases of public warnings of alleged misdeeds by a user
against other users deemed required for the protection of the community).</i></p>
<p>
<u><b>Introduction</b></u></p>

<u><b>Use of your Personal Data</b></u></p>
<p>
WebMagic collects, stores and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and to deliver the services you have requested.</p>

that may be offered.</p>
<p>
WebMagic may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from WebMagicand its affiliates.</p>

Our Privacy Policy exists to protect all our visitors and our sites--not the rare individual with evil intent.
If we, in our sole discretion, believe that any visitor(s) has or has had dishonorable intentions against us or other users on our network,
we reserve the right to use any of your information in any way we see fit, in particular in ways to protect us, our other
users, and society as a whole, and to inform and educate our other users. This includes any users who we suspect are spamming us
or our users, data mining our sites, attempting fraud against us or our users, harassment of us or our users, or any other activity
which we deem to be anti-social. In the past, we have felt the need to take this action against well less than 1/10 of 1% of our
visitors. When it does happen, it usually involves a visitor trying to bring harm to message forums or other users on message forums.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Additional Parties</b></u></p>
<p>
We do not share your contact information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent, except potentially in cases of limited and specific law enforcement or government request. However, you hereby grant us consent to share your information as we deem necessary for the safety of our company, sites, and other users if we believe you are using our services to attempt to defraud us or others. Historically, we have made such determinations in less than one in 10,000 users,
and only shared data in a small subset of those cases.</p>
<p>

<p>
WebMagic may from time to time contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of

or phone number) is not transferred to the third party. </p>
<p>
WebMagic may share your data with trusted partners to help perform payment processing, security services,
statistical analysis, email servicing, postal mail, customer support, surveys, direct marketing, or to arrange for deliveries. Service providers
will only be provided such information as is related to their roles in assisting WebMagic. Except as authorized by you,
all such third parties are
prohibited from using your personally identifiable information except to provide these services to WebMagic,
and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. </p>
<p>

Google and Yahoo. Their own privacy policies likely apply to this sponsored content.</p>
<p>

to third parties; provided that, to the extent permitted by law, WebMagic may use or
disclose personal information: (a) for compliance purposes, such as for customs control, security, and legal support; (b) in connection
with legal requests from (i) governmental authorities or (ii) third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (c) to perform
payment or identity verifications, debt reporting or collection, or to otherwise protect the rights or property of WebMagic,
its officers, employees, customers, affiliates, or end users, or (d) if we sell or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets
related to any website that we own or operate or any product or service that we offer, in which event, we will require such third party
to honor our current Privacy Policy, until the third party provides you with notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and permits you to
exercise any rights you may have under applicable law to limit disclosures of information about you.</p>
<p>
Beyond the policies listed herein, WebMagic will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by
law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process
served on WebMagic or its sites; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WebMagic; and (c) act under exigent circumstances
to protect the personal safety of users of WebMagic, or the public.</p>

specific requests regarding working to remove any such information. We will review such requests on a case-by-case basis.
Please do not ask us to delete messages in bulk that you posted to public message forum threads, as it is typically not possible to
