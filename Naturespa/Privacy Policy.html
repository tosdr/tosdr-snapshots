                <p>The request to opt-out from the mailing list shall be honored immediately. You may not be able to opt out of all information sharing, however, such as information sharing with credit card processors in connection with products or services that you order from us. While we offer you some control over marketing communication, certain transactional, relationship, and legally required communications will not be affected by the choices you have made about marketing communications.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to release and disclose any personal information relative or provided by you to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary to comply with any applicable law or at the request any governmental entity or agency.</p>

                <h4>SECTION 2 – CONSENT AS BASIS</h4>
                <p>How do you get my consent?</p>
                <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, you consent to our collecting your personal information and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
                <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
                <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
                <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, at any time, by contacting us at email address <a href="mailto:support@naturespashowerpurifier.com">support@naturespashowerpurifier.com</a>, by following the opt-out instructions in the email or newsletter, or by sending mail to Customer Service Team with address at Prestige Alliance Limited 48 Bi-State Plaza #617, Old Tappan, NJ 07675. You may not be able to opt out of all information sharing, however, such as information sharing with credit card processors in connection with products or services that you order from us. Certain transactional, relationship, and legally required communications will not be affected by the choices you have made about information sharing. Depending on the service, collection and use of your Personal Data may be required for the services to work.</p>
                <p>We collect and process your Personal Data for a variety of purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain cases, separate consent is not required, including:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>For the performance of our contractual obligations to you;</li>
                  <li>To meet legal obligations or compliance with laws, regulations, court orders, or other legal obligations or to assist in an investigation; or</li>
                  <li>For Legitimate Interests or to operate our business and provide the services, other than in performing our contractual obligations to you for our company’s "legitimate interests" for the purposes of applicable law - except where overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of Personal Data.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can, at any time, request to edit, update, access or delete your information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@naturespashowerpurifier.com">support@naturespashowerpurifier.com</a>. We shall, promptly following receipt of notice, delete Personal Data from our records and, upon completion of all transactions, comply with all reasonable instructions with respect to the deletion of any remaining Personal Data. We will not retain data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. You may request for a copy of your Personal Data, free of charge and in an electronic format. You may request for all Personal Data to be provided in a commonly used and machine-readable format and once obtained, you have the right to take the same to another company.</p>
                <h4>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h4>
                <p>We may disclose your Personal Data for the purposes as described in the prior sections of this Privacy Policy, and in the following ways:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To Affiliates and Partners: With companies or ventures that are owned or controlled by us, and internally within our company, in order to provide and improve services, for marketing purposes, and for advertising.</li>
                  <li>To Service Providers and Vendors: With business partners, marketing partners, and vendors to provide, improve, and personalize our services.</li>

                  <li>For Legal Compliance, Law Enforcement, and Public Safety Purposes: With law enforcement, government or regulatory bodies, lawful authorities, or other authorized third parties in order to comply with laws, regulations, court orders, or other legal obligations or to assist in an investigation, to protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights or safety of third parties, to enforce our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or agreements with third parties, or for crime-prevention purposes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform certain services they provide to us. Certain third-party services, such as payment gateways and other transaction or payment processors are required to abide by security standards imposed on them, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all payment processors that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. All direct payment gateways we utilize adhere to PCI-DSS, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, to safeguard card data handling.</p>
                <p>Whilst we shall not store your credit card information, such payment gateways and other transaction or payment processors, under PCI-DSS, may store your purchase transaction data for only as long as is necessary to complete the transaction and thereafter for only as long as it is required by law.</p>
                <p>Such third-party payment gateways and other payment transaction processors and other third parties have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
                <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
                <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
                <p>Once you leave our Site or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
                <h4>SECTION 5 – ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TELEMARKETING AND TEXT MESSAGES</h4>
                <p>By providing your prior express consent/opt-in in accordance with applicable law, you consent to receive communications from us electronically. Although we may choose to communicate with you by other means, we may also choose to solely communicate with you electronically by e-mail or by posting notices on the Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we send to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>
                <p>Where you provide “prior express written consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) or any applicable law, you consent to receive telephone calls, including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology and text and SMS messages to the telephone number(s) that you provided from us listed in and hyperlinked to the consent. Message Frequency Varies. The mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered Messages. Consumers may request up to a maximum of twenty (20) messages per month, with no more than three (3) text messages in one day.</p>
                <p>You understand that the text messages we send may be seen by anyone with access to your phone. Accordingly, you should take steps to safeguard your phone and your text messages if you want them to remain private.</p>
                <p>If you wish to stop receiving text messages from us, reply to any text message we have sent you and simply text “STOP”, “END” or “QUIT”. You may also request to stop receiving text messages by calling us or emailing us using the following information:</p>
                <p>By email: <a href="mailto:support@naturespashowerpurifier.com">support@naturespashowerpurifier.com</a>.<br>By Phone: <br>United States &amp; Canada TF: 855 378 9408</p>
                <p>If at any time you need our contact information or information on how to stop text messages, reply to any text message we have sent you and simply text HELP or click here for support. Message and Data Rates May Apply to any text/SMS communication.</p>
                <h4>SECTION 6 - LINKS</h4>

                <p>If you provide us with sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card information, then such information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with an AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we use generally acceptable commercially standards to protect your personal information.</p>
                <h4>SECTION 8 – BREACH</h4>
                <p>Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we shall notify you, as soon as it is reasonably possible under the circumstances but in any event no later than within 72 hours after becoming aware, of any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data ("Security Breach") likely to result in a high risk of adversely affecting individuals’ rights and freedom. Such notification shall include: (a) a detailed description of the Security Breach, and (b) the type of data that was the subject of the Security Breach and we shall communicate (i) the name and contact details of our data protection officer or other point of contact where more information can be obtained; (ii) a description of the likely consequences of the Security Breach; (iii) a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by us to address the Security Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects; and (iv) additionally in such notification or thereafter as soon as such information can be collected or otherwise becomes available, any other information you may reasonably request relating to the Security Breach.</p>
                <p>We shall take prompt action to investigate the Security Breach and shall use industry standard, commercially reasonable, efforts to mitigate the effects of any such Security Breach in accordance with its obligations hereunder and, subject to your prior written agreement, to carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the Security Breach. Unless required to do so under applicable Privacy Law, we shall not release or publish any filing, communication, notice, press release, or report concerning any Security Breach. We shall also report such Security Breach as may be required by law to relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware, where feasible.</p>
                <h4>SECTION 9 – GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION</h4>
                <p>Where personal data originating in the European Economic Area is processed outside the European Economic Area, in a territory that has not been designated by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection pursuant to applicable Privacy Law, we agree that the transfer shall be undertaken pursuant to SECTION 6 above, which we shall maintain in full force and effect.</p>
                <p>We have data processing agreements in place to ensure compliance with all relevant Directives. All processing is performed in accordance with the highest security regulations.</p>
