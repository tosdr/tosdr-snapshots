		<h1> MARU/BLUE COOKIE POLICY </h1>

<p>
This Cookie Policy (the ”Policy”) describes how Maru/Blue Canada Inc. and Maru/Blue US LLC (collectively “Maru/Blue”, “us” or “we”) uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and store information when you visit this website (the “Site”). For additional information on our privacy practices, please visit our <a href="https://www.marublue.net/privacy">privacy policy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Should you have any questions regarding this Policy, you can contact our Privacy Officer by email at <a href="mailto:mailto:privacy@marublue.net">privacy@marublue.net</a>, or by mail at:
</p>

<p>
2 Bloor Street East, Suite 1600<br/>

Attention: Privacy Officer<br/>

</p>

<h2> WHAT ARE COOKIES? </h2>

<p>
When you visit the Site, Maru/Blue or a third party may send you a cookie. Cookies are small text files that may be placed in your browser directory on your computer or mobile device. When a website is accessed, a cookie that is placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed the cookie. Cookies are extremely common and used on most websites. Each cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value (usually a unique number). For a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they operate, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
</p>

<h2> WHY ARE COOKIES USEFUL? </h2>

<p>
In general, the purpose of cookies is to improve the performance of the Site and your experience while visiting the Site. Cookies help make your visits easier by recognizing you upon return and providing a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to do useful things; for example, cookies allow us to find out whether you have visited the Site previously. Cookies help us make the Site work more efficiently, enable extra functionality, and provide us with additional information about your visit. Cookies also allow us to track overall Site usage and determine areas that users prefer.
</p>

<h2> FIRST PARTY AND THIRD PARTY COOKIES </h2>

<p>
Our Site may place first party cookies and allow third parties to place cookies on your device. The difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who serves the cookie. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them. Their use enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of visitors to the Site. Third party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by Maru/Blue). While we may allow third parties access to the Site to place these cookies on users’ devices, for example by embedding functionality such as Social Media widgets, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the cookies, nor do we retain access to that data. Some third party cookies have the ability to track your browsing activity across sites, such as ad networks which are intended to deliver relevant, targeted ads to you and services delivered on external websites. This information is controlled wholly by those third parties in accordance with their respective privacy policies. We do not share your personal information with the third parties for their own use.
</p>

<h2> SESSION AND PERSISTENT COOKIES </h2>

<p>
Our Site may place session and persistent cookies on your device. Whereas the difference between a first party and third party cookie relates to the party controlling the initial placement of the cookie on your device, the difference between a session and a persistent cookie relates to the length of time the cookie lasts. Session cookies are cookies that typically last for as long as you are using your browser, also known as a browser session. When you end your browser session, the cookie expires. Persistent cookies, as the name implies, are persistent and will last after you close your browser. This allows for quicker and often more convenient access to our Site among other functionality.
</p>

<h2> LINKING OF COOKIE DATA WITH OTHER DATA </h2>

<p>
Information gathered through usage of a cookie is not generally linked to any direct personal identifiers (e.g., your name or e-mail address). Once you submit personal data on our sites however (e.g., by signing up to receive information from us, become a customer, etc.), we may link such personal data with cookies or other data that are associated with your visit(s) to our Site. This linkage allows us to create a ‘profile’ of your preferences so that we may tailor Site content, offers, and promotions to your interests.
</p>

<h2> DISABLING, DELETING, OR OPTING OUT OF COOKIES </h2>

<p>
If you do not want to have cookies placed on your device by third parties, many of them offer ways to opt-out. Most web browsers allow you to view and control most cookies through browser settings. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser to decline cookies. You may also delete existing cookies through your browser. Information on deleting/controlling cookies for specific browsers can be found at <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Please note that if you delete cookies, or visit from another browser or device, you may need to set your preferences again including opt-out preferences. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. In particular, you may have limited access to some areas or be transitioned to a different experience.Please note that if you delete cookies, or visit from another browser or device, you may need to set your preferences again including opt-out preferences. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. In particular, you may have limited access to some areas or be transitioned to a different experience.
</p>

<h2> SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES </h2>

<p>
There are other technologies that perform a similar function to cookies. These include web beacons and clear gifs, local shared objects (also known as “LSOs” or “Flash cookies”), and digital fingerprints. These technologies may be used in conjunction with cookies to help us generate additional functionality and data:
<ul>
<li>Web beacons/clear gifs – When we send you newsletters or other messages we use these technologies so that we can track email open and click rates, which in conjunction with cookies helps us understand your interests and send you more relevant, targeted messages.</li>
<li>Digital fingerprinting – When you become a member of our Market Communities, we use “digital fingerprinting” technology to help us uniquely identify you, and to ensure the integrity of survey results by suppressing duplicate accounts, fraudulent surveys, and fraudulent responses. To create the digital fingerprint, we use third party technology to collect data points about your computer and to generate a unique identifier by combining those data points. This digital fingerprint cannot reveal your personal identity on its own, and your personal information is not transferred to any third party via the digital fingerprint without your consent.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> DO NOT TRACK SIGNAL </h2>

<p>
Some browsers allow you to send a ‘Do Not Track’ request when you visit a website. Aside from the cookie related settings listed above, this Site does not process Do Not Track signals sent by your browser.
</p>

<h2> CHANGES TO THIS POLICY </h2>

<p>
Maru/Blue encourages you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed of how we manage your personal information. If any changes are made to this Policy, Maru/Blue will revise the “Last Updated” date that is indicated on the Policy.
</p>

<p><strong>Last Updated: January 16, 2019</strong></p><p>You currently have the following cookies set on this site: </p><h2>server</h2>
<p>
Our application sets a cookie called 'server' whenever you access anything that might require you to be directed to the
same server in our cluster for all the pages in your visit.  It contains only the name of our server, and no tracking or
other IDs.   E.g. it might contain "www32" indicating you are on our server called www32 for your session.
</p>
<p>
This cookie contains no tracking information, is not used by our research or other software in any way other than to
check that you are correctly staying on the same server during your session, and is deleted automatically at the end of
your session.
</p>
<h2>Raa_Authenticated_Token / authkey</h2>
<p>
This cookie is set when you log in to one of our sites, and maintains your login session with us. 
</p>
<p>
This cookie does not do any tracking on its own - but it contains a reference to the user account you have on the site
you logged in to.  Your activities on the site (when logged in) may be logged or analysed in accordance with the terms
&amp; conditions of that site.  Only the web site you logged in to can 'see' this cookie - and it cannot be used to
log you in or track your activity on any other web site.
</p>
<p>
The cookie will be deleted either at the end of your session or, if you ticked a "remember me" box, then at a point a
few months after you log in.
</p>
<h2>eDR_eGP_PanelSite</h2>
<p>
This cookie is created by our site infrastructure in order to maintain information across your session.   
</p>
<p>
If you log in, additional information from your account may be linked to this cookie, and used in accordance with the
terms and conditions you agreed to when you registered.  This cookie is automatically deleted at the end of your
session.
</p>

<h2> eps </h2>

<p>
Our polling/voting feature (ePollingStation) uses a separate cookie to keep track of which polls you have participated
in, and when.
</p>
<p>
This uses a permanent cookie called 'eps' which is created when you answer a poll.   It stores only the ID of each
poll you have answered, and the date+time you answered it.  It does not store what answer you gave to the poll, or any
other information about you or your browsing history.
</p>
<p>
This cookie exists only to ensure you aren't offered the same poll too often on a site, and to show you the results 
for polls you have already answered.  A cookie is used because our platform - for speed/efficiency reasons - queues the
answer you gave before inserting it into our analysis databases.  Before your answer has been imported the cookie is the
only way the system knows to show you the answers instead of displaying the same question again.
</p>
<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is used on this site and will also set cookies of its
own.   Google Analytics provides important information about how people access the site - like which pages are most
popular.
</p>
<p>
It sets four cookies, the names of which start with "__utm".  They keep track of the pages you visit and provide this
to Google for inclusion in analytics reports.
</p>
<p>
Please note that it is not possible for us (or anyone except Google) to join your analytics data with anything
identifiable about you.  This data can only be used on its own in aggregated non-identifiable form.
