</h3>

<p>Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.</p>

Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>

  Categories of personal information collected, used, sold, or shared
</h4>
<p>In this section we summarize the categories of personal information that we've collected, used, sold, or shared and the purposes thereof. <strong>You can read about these activities in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.</strong></p>

<h5>Information we collect: the categories of personal information we collect</h5>
<p>We have collected the following categories of personal information about you: identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, employment related information and inferences drawn from other personal information.</p>

  <p>
    We do not collect sensitive personal information.
  </p>

<p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.</p>


<h5>What are the purposes for which we use your personal information?</h5>
<p>We may use your personal information to allow the operational functioning of this Website and features thereof (“business purposes”). In such cases, your personal information will be processed in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly within the limits of compatible operational purposes.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information for other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.</p>
<p>We won’t process your information for unexpected purposes, or for purposes incompatible with the purposes originally disclosed, without your consent.</p>


<h5>How long do we keep your personal information?</h5>
<p>Unless stated otherwise inside the “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” section, we will not retain your personal information for longer than is reasonably necessary for the purpose(s) they have been collected for.</p>


<h5>How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal information we collect?</h5>
<p>We collect the above-mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or indirectly, from you when you use this Website.</p>
<p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms on this Website. You also provide personal information indirectly when you navigate this Website, as personal information about you is automatically observed and collected.</p>

  <p>Finally, we may collect your personal information from third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or with the functioning of this Application and features thereof.</p>

<h5>How we use the information we collect: disclosing of your personal information with third parties for a business purpose</h5>

  <p>For our purposes, the word “third party” means a person who is not any of the following: a service provider or a contractor, as defined by the CCPA.</p>
  <p>We disclose your personal information with the third parties <b>listed in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.</b> These third parties are grouped and categorized in accordance with the different purposes of processing.</p>

    <h5>Sale or sharing of your personal information</h5>
<p>For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic means, a consumer's personal information by the business to <strong>a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration</strong>”, as defined by the CCPA.</p>
<p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>
<p>For our purposes, the word “sharing” means any “sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a business and a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising for the benefit of a business in which no money is exchanged”, as defined by the CCPA.<br />
Please note that the exchange of personal information with a service provider pursuant to a written contract that meets the requirements set by the CCPA, does not constitute a sale or sharing of your personal information.</p>

<h6>Your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information and how you can exercise it</h6>
<p>We sell or share your personal information with the third parties <b>listed in detail in the section titled “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data” within this document.</b> These third parties are grouped and categorized in accordance with the different purposes of processing.<br /><br />You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information.

<p>If you want to submit requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information via a user-enabled global privacy control, like the Global Privacy Control (“<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">GPC</a>”), you are free to do so and we will abide by such request in a frictionless manner (as defined in the CPRA regulations). The GPC consists of a setting or extension in the browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the GPC signal. If you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download">participating browser</a> or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC is available <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We use any personal information collected from you in connection with the submission of your opt-out request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out request.</p>
<p>Once you have opted out, we are required to wait at least 12 months before asking whether you have changed your mind.</p>

  Your privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and how to exercise them
</h3>

<h4>The right to access personal information: the right to know and to portability</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the categories of personal information that we collect about you;</li>
  <li>the sources from which the personal information is collected;</li>
  <li>the purposes for which we use your information;</li>
  <li>to whom we disclose such information;</li>
  <li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>

<p>You also have <b>the right to know what personal information is sold or shared and to whom.</b> In particular, you have the right to request two separate lists from us where we disclose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the categories of personal information that we sold or shared about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared; </li>
  <li>the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose and the categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a business purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.</p>

<h4>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Website, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>
<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.</p>

<h4>The right to correct inaccurate personal information</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.</p>

<h4>The right to opt out of sale or sharing of personal information and to limit the use of your sensitive personal information</h4>
<p>You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You also have the right to request that we limit our use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.</p>

<h4>The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other rights (the right to non-discrimination)</h4>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.</p>
<p>However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.</p>

  <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>
<p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
  <li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>

<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.</p>
<p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p>

  <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>
<p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.</p>
<p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
