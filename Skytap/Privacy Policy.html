                        <p></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3> 
						
			<p>Skytap considers your privacy paramount, and we take great care in keeping private and secure the personally identifying information that we gather related to users of our Website and/or Services and other third parties related to our business. This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the information that we collect or process related to when You use our Services, Website and/or other products, as well as how we use, disclose, protect, and share Your information, and where required by applicable law, the information we gather about individuals in the ordinary course of conducting our business. Except where indicated otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services that are not under Skytap’s control; those parties’ services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
			<p>Certain jurisdictions worldwide have enacted laws related generally to processing the personal information about individuals.</p>

			<ul class="mb-5">
				<li>
					<p>If you are located in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation effective 25 May 2018 (“GDPR”) applies to information about you while you were in the European Union (“Personal Data” under GDPR) that Skytap may collect. (NOTE: as the definition below states, “GDPR” as used in this Privacy Policy also will refer to the UK General Data Protection Regulation if you are located in the United Kingdom because, for purposes of this Privacy Policy and in general, these two forms of distinct and potentially applicable Data Protection Legislation are materially the same.) In that case, and under GDPR, you are defined as a “Data Subject,” Skytap is a “Data Controller” for Personal Data that Skytap obtains and “Processes,” and this policy explains your rights with respect to that Personal Data. (For clarity, Skytap’s primary Services offering provides a virtualized server environment for Skytap customers to process and control data within their own virtualized server workloads. This customer data may or may not be Personal Data. If the customer data the customers process includes Personal Data, then in that situation, between Skytap and the customer, Skytap is a Data Processor, and the customer is the Data Controller. However, in this circumstance, Skytap’s role is passive, and it does not collect or meaningfully use the customer’s data.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If you reside in California, The California Consumer Privacy Act, codified at Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), including any other future amendments as well as any final implementing regulations adopted either by the State of California Privacy Protection Agency (collectively, “CCPA/CPRA”) also now protects “Personal Information” that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with, or reasonably can be linked (directly or indirectly) with a specific individual (“Consumers”) or household in California.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Definitions</h3>
			<p><strong>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
			<div class="pl-4">
				<p><strong>Account</strong> means a unique account created for you to access our Services or parts of our Services.</p>
				<p><strong>Affiliate</strong> means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where “control” means ownership of 50% or more of the shares, equity interest or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors or other managing authority.</p>
				<p><strong>Business</strong>, for the purpose of CCPA/CPRA, refers to Skytap as the legal entity that collects Consumers’ personal information and determines the purposes and means of the processing of Consumers’ personal information, or on behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers’ personal information, that does business in the State of California.</p>
				<p><strong>CCPA/CPRA</strong> refers to California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”).</p>
				<p><strong>Consumer</strong>, for the purpose of the CCPA/CPRA, means a natural person who is a California resident. A resident, as defined in the law, includes (1) every individual who is in the USA for other than a temporary or transitory purpose, and (2) every individual who is domiciled in the USA who is outside the USA for a temporary or transitory purpose.</p>
				<p><strong>Cookies</strong> are small files that are placed on your computer, mobile device or any other device by a website, containing the details of your browsing history on that website among its many uses.</p>
				<p><strong>Data Controller</strong>, for the purposes of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), refers to Skytap as the legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.</p>
				<p><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Website and/or Services such as a computer, a cellphone or a digital tablet.</p>
				<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong> (DNT) is a concept that has been promoted by US regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.</p>
				<p><strong>GDPR</strong> refers generally to both of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the variant adopted by the United Kingdom post-“Brexit”.</p>
				<p><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., a Data Subject or a Consumer depending on the applicable regulation).</p>
				<p>For the purposes of GDPR, Personal Data means any information relating to you such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.</p>
				<p>For the purposes of the CCPA/CPRA, Personal Data means any information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a “Consumer”. Also, for clarity, CCPA/CPRA refers to Personal Data as “Personal Information.”</p>
				<p><strong>Services</strong> refers to the virtualized Infrastructure as a Service that Skytap makes generally available for subscription to companies via “<a href="http://cloud.skytap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud.skytap.com</a>”, and that is augmented and supported by “<a href="http://help.skytap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help.skytap.com</a>”, and “<a href="http://learn.skytap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn.skytap.com</a>”.</p>
				<p><strong>Service Provider</strong> means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of Skytap. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by Skytap to facilitate the Website and/or Services, to provide the Services on behalf of Skytap, to perform services related to the Website and/or Services or to assist Skytap in analyzing how the Website and/or Services are used. For the purpose of the GDPR, Service Providers are considered Data Processors.</p>
				<p><strong>Skytap</strong> (also referred to as either “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy) refers to the owner/operator of the Website and Services, Skytap, Inc., 255 S King St, Ste 800, Seattle, WA 98104, <a href="tel:206-866-1162">206-866-1162</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>Usage Data</strong> refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Website and/or Services or from the Website and/or Services infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).</p>
				<p><strong>Website</strong> refers to <a href="http://www.skytap.com">www.skytap.com</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>You</strong> means the individual accessing or using the Website and/or Services, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Website and/or Services, as applicable.</p>
			</div>
			<p>If GDPR applies to you and your Personal Data, under GDPR, you can be referred to as the Data Subject or as the user when you are the individual using the Website and/or Services. If CCPA/CPRA applies to you and your Personal Information, under CCPA/CPRA, you can be referred to as the Consumer as the individual using the Website and/or Services.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h3>How the Privacy Policy Addresses the Requirements of GDPR and CCPA/CPRA and Any Other Privacy and Data Protection Regulations that Apply in the Future</h3>
			<p>This Privacy Policy was originally written, revised, and adopted by Skytap with regard to GDPR because GDPR was the first comprehensive and general privacy regulation enacted world-wide that potentially applied to Skytap. California followed GDPR by enacting CCPA, which later was amended by CPRA. Thus, for general purposes and simplicity, (1) the term “Personal Data” in this Privacy Policy more often also will refer to “Personal Information” under CCPA/CPRA and other applicable regulations, (2) the term “Data Subject” in this Privacy Policy will also refer to the persons protected under CCPA/CPRA as a “Consumer”, and (3) the term “Controller” in this Privacy Policy will refer to the persons and organizations regulated by CCPA/CPRA or other regulations (as CCPA/CPRA defines each of these organizations as a “Business”, unless a provision of this Privacy Policy or another related on-line disclosure linked to this Privacy Policy specifically and uniquely refers to CCPA/CPRA, in which case the CCPA/CPRA specifically defined terms from that other regulation may be used instead.</p>

			<h3>Skytap as a GDPR Data Processor</h3>
			<p>Skytap primarily provides its customers with virtualized hosting infrastructure, has limited knowledge of customer data within that infrastructure, and only processes hosted data in accordance with the customer’s instructions. Skytap is a Processor of hosted customer data. The customer is the Controller for that hosted customer data.</p>
			<p>Skytap hosts information under the direction of its customers and may have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes technically through the customers’ use of Skytap’s virtualized infrastructure technology as a subscription service offering, which is part of the Services from Skytap. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their request to the Skytap customer (the Data Controller).</p>
			<p>Similarly, Skytap has no direct control over the data collected by its customers. Skytap customers choose the geographical regions for the storage of data for which they are the Controller, are directly responsible for the security, configuration, and administration of their Skytap environments, and are responsible for adhering to legal and regulatory requirements for the data which they collect and process as a Controller.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Skytap as a GDPR Data Controller</h3>
			<p>In some circumstances, such as during the account registration process for customer use of Skytap Services, Skytap collects and maintains Personal Data. This data is collected and maintained solely for the offer and maintenance of Skytap Services for customer use, and for the relevant communications and uses detailed within this policy. For these purposes, Skytap is the Controller. Skytap also collects Personal Data of the Data Subjects with whom it interacts or wishes to interact with for its general business purpose including sales and marketing of the Skytap Services</p>
			<p>The collection and processing of your Personal Data for direct use and administration of our Services is based on contractual obligation, necessary to provide You with access and use of the Services.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Personal Data We Collect</h3>

This may include purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties, that is combined with information we already have about You, to create more tailored marketing content and Services related to You.</p>
			
			<h4>How We Use Personal Data</h4>
			<p>This section describes how Skytap uses the Personal Data that we collect to operate our business and to provide you our Website and/or Services, including improvements to the same, and in the personalization of your experiences with the same. We may also use the data to communicate with you, providing account information, security updates and Services information. We may transfer personal information to companies that as a service to us help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers and our agreements with our vendors. Additionally, data is used to market our Services, to comply with applicable laws and legal processes, to enforce our terms and conditions, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain.</p>
			<p><strong>To provide a requested service or carry out a contract with you</strong></p>
			<p>We use data collected from you in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customer Support: to diagnose and repair technical issues and provide other customer care and support services.</li>

			<p>We use data collected from you in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Service Personalization: to include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and user experience enjoyment, and automatically tailor your Service experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests, and locations. To better understand how to access and control the Personal Data collected for these types of processing, please see the <a href="#access-and-control"><strong>Access and Control</strong></a> section below.</li>

For example, we use error reports to improve security features of our Website and/or Services, and usage data to determine new features or Services to prioritize.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where we rely on legitimate interest for processing your information, we carry out a ‘balancing test’ to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests before we go ahead with such processing. You can find out more about the information in these balancing tests by contacting us using the details below.</p>
			<p><strong>Where we have your consent</strong></p>
			<p>We use data we collect to communicate with you in a variety of formats and to tailor those communications to you. Examples include inviting you to participate in surveys, email subscriptions, and promotional communications from Skytap, by email, SMS, physical mail, or telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, please visit the <a href="#access-and-control"><strong>Access and Controls</strong></a> section of this privacy statement.</p>
			<p><strong>Automated decision making</strong></p>
			<p>Skytap employs automated decision making (also known as “profiling”) in the processing of your data in <span style="text-decoration:underline">very limited ways</span>, and only in accordance with the specifications of this Policy and applicable laws. For example, we may auto-assign customer support personnel to respond to your inquiries, based on Your organization or employer, and necessary details of that contract, or auto-assign a regional contact to assist you, based on your location. These actions are necessary to provide you with our Services and related support.</p>
			
			<p>Similarly, some automated decision making is used, with your consent, to determine appropriate communications to You, as detailed above.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4>Reasons We Share Personal Data</h4>
			<p>This section describes how Skytap may share and disclose Personal Data. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of data, and Skytap does not control how they choose to share or disclose Information.</p>
			<p>Skytap may share your Personal Data with your consent, or as necessary to complete a transaction or provide Services you have requested or authorized. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you elect to use connected third-party applications, we may share Personal Data with companies who provide those applications. In those cases, we encourage you to review and understand the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties, over whom we have no control.</li>
				<li>We may disclose generic, aggregated (pseudonymized) demographic information, not linked to any specific Data Subject, regarding Skytap visitors and users to our business partners, trusted affiliates, and suppliers or agents working on our behalf.</li>
				<li>We may use third-party service providers to help us operate or administer the Website and/or Services. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or to assist in protecting and securing our services and systems may need access to Personal Data to complete those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use Personal Data they receive from us for any other purpose.</li>
				<li>We may disclose Personal Data to a third-party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
				<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate, we may disclose Personal Data: (a) under applicable laws, including laws outside Your country of residence; (b) to comply with a subpoena or other legal process; © to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
			<p>Skytap has adopted reasonable security measures to protect Personal Data against loss, theft, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access control, and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Skytap uses industry standard encryption to facilitate the exchange and transmission of data. Skytap only processes Personal Data in compliance with the purposes for which it has been collected, in accordance with this Policy.</p>
			<p>In the event that Personal Data is acquired by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification, we will promptly notify the affected Data Subject. Notice will be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and any measures necessary for Skytap or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of a system. Skytap may delay notification if we, or a law enforcement agency, determine that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. In such case, notification will not be provided unless and until we or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Data Retention</h3>
			<p>We only retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for us to use your information as described above or to comply with our legal obligations. Please be advised that this means that we may retain some of Your information after you cease to use our Services. For instance, we may retain your data as necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as for tax and accounting purposes.</p>
			<p>When determining the relevant retention periods, we take the following factors into account:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved;</li>
				<li>legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</li>
				<li>our legitimate interest where we have carried out a balancing test;</li>
				<li>statute of limitations under applicable law(s);</li>
				<li>(potential) disputes;</li>
				<li>if You have made a request to have your information deleted; and</li>
				<li>guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Otherwise, we securely erase your information once this is no longer needed.</p>

Skytap has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles regarding the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) under the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.

			<br>
			
			<p><strong>Application of Standard Contractual Clauses or EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension, and/or Swiss DPF</strong></p>
			<p>Skytap’s default mechanism for addressing personal data transfers is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>EU-U.S. DPF</strong> – For data transfers from the EU to the U.S., as of October 9, 2023, Skytap’s certification under the EU-U.S. DPF.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>UK Extension</strong> – Although Skytap has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Government has not yet adopted an adequacy decision with respect to the UK Extension and, therefore, it is not yet in force. Upon the date of the UK Extension’s entry into force, for personal data transfers from the UK to the U.S., Skytap’s certification of the UK Extension.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Swiss-U.S. DPF</strong> – The Swiss Government is currently engaged in discussions with the U.S. on a framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) substantially similar to the EU-U.S. DPF. When available, Skytap will certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles regarding transfers of personal data from Switzerland to the U.S. When the Swiss Government adopts an adequacy decision with respect to the Swiss-U.S. DPF, on the date of its entry into force, for personal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S., Skytap’s certification of the Swiss-U.S. PDF.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Until entry into force of the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Skytap will offer the Standard Contractual Clauses with provisions to meet the adequacy and security requirements of the UK and Switzerland. Notwithstanding Skytap’s default mechanism for internal data transfers, Skytap will continue to offer the Standard Contractual Clauses for personal data transfers from the EU, the UK, and Switzerland to the U.S., if requested by a Customer.</p>

			<h3>CCPA/CPRA Privacy Notice Skytap General Disclosures and Your Rights</h3>
			<p>This privacy notice section for California residents supplements the information contained in Skytap’s Privacy Policy and it applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California.</p>
			<p><strong>Categories of Personal Information Collected</strong></p>
			<p>We have described the Personal Information that we may collect and process above in the main portion of this Privacy Policy. We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular Consumer or Device. The following is a list of categories of personal information which we may collect or may have been collected from California residents within the last twelve (12) months.</p>
			<p>Please note that the categories and examples provided in the list below are those defined in the CCPA/CPRA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact collected by us, but reflects what Skytap in good faith believe of that information from the applicable category Skytap may have collected. For example, certain categories of personal information would only be collected if You provided such personal information directly to Skytap.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Category A: Identifiers.</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> A real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.<br>
			<strong>Collected:</strong> Yes, from Consumers who visit the Website or are administrative users of the Skytap Services.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)).</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> A name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver’s license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, or health insurance information. Some personal information included in this category may overlap with other categories.<br>

			<br>

			<h4>Category D: Commercial information.</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Records and history of products or services purchased or considered.<br>

Skytap only collects personal information in relation to “business-to-business” activities, and so the ultimate purchaser of products or services is a business for which the individual “consumer” is acting, and these businesses more typically are separate legal entities. Skytap does collect information about purchase history of such legal entities, as represented through the individuals who act for such commercial legal entities.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Category E: Biometric information.</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics, or activity patterns used to extract a template or other identifier or identifying information, such as, fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, or exercise data.<br>

			<br>

			<h4>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity.</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Interaction with our Website and/or Services.<br>

			<br>

			<h4>Category J: Inferences drawn from other personal information.</h4>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Profile reflecting a person’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.<br>

			<p>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity</p>

			<p>We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly understood. We do allow Service Providers to use your personal information for the business purposes described an agreement we have with the Service Provide or in our Privacy Policy.</p>

			<h3>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h3>
			<p>We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly understood. We do allow Service Providers to use your personal information for the business purposes described in an agreement we have with the Service Provide or in our Privacy Policy. CCPA/CPRA, however, adds specific requirements for third parties to be a “Service Provider” to otherwise avoid transfer of Personal Information to these third parties being deemed a “Sale” under CCPA/CPRA. As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, “sell” and “sale” mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a Consumer’s personal information by the Business to a third party for valuable consideration.</p>
			<p>Because Service Providers we partner with (for example, our analytics providers) may use technology on the Services that results in sale of personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA law. If you wish to opt out of this use of your personal information that could result in potential sales as defined under CCPA/CPRA, you may do so by following the instructions below.</p>

			<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap considers your privacy paramount, and we take great care in keeping the information of our users private and secure. This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the information that we collect or process when you use our services, websites and/or products (the “Services”), as well as how we use, disclose, protect, and share your information. Except where indicated otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services that are not under Skytap’s control; those parties’ services are governed by their own privacy policies.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are located in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation effective 25 May 2018 (“GDPR”) applies to information about you (“Personal Data” under GDPR) that Skytap may collect. (NOTE: “GDPR” as used in this Privacy Policy also will refer to the UK General Data Protection Regulation if you are located in the United Kingdom because, for purposes of this Privacy Policy and in general, these two forms of distinct and potentially applicable Data Protection Legislation are materially the same.) In that case, and under GDPR, you are defined as a “Data Subject,” Skytap is a “Data Controller” for Personal Data that Skytap obtains and “Processes,” and this policy explains your rights with respect to that Personal Data.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, The California Consumer Privacy Act, codified at Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., including future amendments as well as any final implementing regulations adopted either by the State of California Department of Justice Office of The Attorney General or the California Privacy Protection Agency (collectively, “CCPA”) also now protects “Personal Information” that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with, or reasonably can be linked (directly or indirectly) with a specific individual (“Consumers”) or household in California. If you think Skytap is processing your Personal Information, please see the section in the Policy below with the heading “Your Rights Under California Privacy Statutes” for more information about Skytap and CCPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><b>Terminology Used in This Privacy Policy Will Align More with GDPR Unless Referring Specifically to a CCPA Requirement</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy has been written, revised, and adopted by Skytap with regard to GDPR, that the EU enacted before California enacted CCPA. Thus, for general purposes and simplicity, (1) the term “Personal Data” in this Privacy Policy will also refer to “Personal Information” under CCPA, (2) the term “Data Subject” in this Privacy Policy will also refer to the persons protected under CCPA, which CCPA defines as “Consumers,” and (3) the term “Controller” in this Privacy Policy will refer to the persons and organizations regulated by CCPA that CCPA defines as a “Business,” unless a provision of this Privacy Policy or in another related on-line disclosure linked to this Privacy Policy is unique to CCPA, in which case the CCPA specifically defined terms may be used instead.</span></p>
			<p><b>Your Rights Under California Privacy Statutes</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cal. Civ. Code Section § 1798.83, commonly referred to as California’s “Shine the Light” law, permits users of our Sites that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to </span><a href="mailto:privacy@skytap.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@skytap.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or write us at: 255 South King Street, Suite 800 Seattle, WA 98104.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap is preparing its processes, technology and disclosures related to managing regulated Personal Information as needed to comply with CCPA by the extended deadline (or its successor as of January 1, 2023, The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 or “CPRA”). Other than CCPA’s regulations related to “Sale” of Personal Information and certain disclosures related to Personal Information of “Consumers” (California residents) seeking employment with or employed by Skytap, Skytap will not become subject to most of CCPA’s requirements under two exemptions, until January 1, 2023. The first of the two CCPA exemptions applies to the remainder of CCPA’s obligations related to any applications by Consumers for, and any resulting, employment with, Skytap and commonly is referred to as “the Employee Personal Information Exemption.” The Employee Personal Information Exemption is codified in CCPA at Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.145(m)(1). The second of the two CCPA Exemptions deferring for Skytap most of CCPA’s obligations applies to businesses collecting Personal Information in the process of doing business with other businesses, and commonly is referred to as “the Temporary B2B Exemption.” The Temporary B2B Exemption is codified in CCPA at Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.145(n)(1).</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap does not sell data about its customers or their employees.&nbsp; CCPA, however, adds specific requirements for third parties to be a “Service Provider” to otherwise avoid transfer of Personal Information to these third parties being deemed a “Sale” under CCPA. Like most companies, managing vendor or other third-party access to Skytap information is a complicated and continuing effort. In this ongoing process, if Skytap determines its relationships with any third-party having access to CCPA Personal Information risks being a “Sale” for lack of meeting the Service Provider definition or satisfying another CCPA exception to a “Sale,” Skytap will promptly act to remediate that relationship by aligning it with CCPA’s Service Provider requirements or otherwise to prevent the relationship resulting in a Sale under CCPA. Again, Skytap has never wanted and Skytap does not want to sell to or provide any Personal Information to any third party for their own exclusive marketing purposes.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap’s required CCPA disclosures that Skytap believes are not subject to the Employee Personal Information Exemption (and that are provided in order to comply with the UK and EU versions of GDPR for employee and employment candidate related Personal Data) are located </span><a href="#ccpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The linked disclosure in the previous sentence relating to employee and candidate Personal Data/Personal Information will be modified as needed to comply generally with any other future applicable data protection and privacy regulations (for example, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act or “VCDPA,” which becomes effective January 1, 2023).</span></p>
			<p><b>Definitions of Data Controller and Processor Under GDPR</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Controller is an agency, entity, or legal person who determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data.</span></li>
				<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Processor is an agency, entity, or legal person with responsibility for processing Personal Data on behalf of a Controller.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Skytap as a GDPR Data Processor</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap primarily provides its customers with hosting infrastructure, has limited knowledge of customer data within that infrastructure, and only processes hosted data in accordance with the customer’s instructions. Skytap is a Processor of hosted data. The customer is the Controller for that hosted data.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap hosts information under the direction of its customers and may have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes technically through the customers’ use of Skytap’s virtualized infrastructure technology as a subscription service offering, which is part of the Services from Skytap. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Skytap customer (the Data Controller).</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Skytap has no direct control over the data collected by its customers. Skytap customers choose the geographical regions for the storage of data for which they are the Controller, are directly responsible for the security, configuration, and administration of their Skytap environments, and are responsible for adhering to legal and regulatory requirements for the data which they collect and process as a Controller.</span></p>
			<p><b>Skytap as a GDPR Data Controller</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some circumstances, such as during the account registration process for customer use of Skytap Services, Skytap collects and maintains Personal Data. This data is collected and maintained solely for the offer and maintenance of Skytap Services for customer use, and for the relevant communications and uses detailed within this policy. For these purposes, Skytap is the Controller.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection and processing of your Personal Data for direct use and administration of our Services is based on contractual obligation, necessary to provide you with access and use of the Services.</span></p>
			<p><b>Personal Data We Collect</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definition of Personal Data</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal Data” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”). An identifiable person is one who can be identified by referencing an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information you give us</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap requires some of your Personal Data to effectively operate, while providing you the best experiences with our Services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you perform transactions with Skytap, such as place an order, create a Skytap account, administer your organization’s dashboard access, or register for a newsletter. This data may include name, username, title, address, organization or employer, phone number, and/or email address.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information we collect automatically</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As is true of most websites, we also gather certain information automatically when you visit our website, mobile application, or interact with our Services. This information is used to analyze aggregated trends and to administer our Services, and may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, the type of device you use, operating system and version, device identifier, where the application was downloaded from, usage information, events that occur within the application, performance data, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Please see the </span><a href="#cookies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies and Similar Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section below for more details.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information we receive from third parties</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or from third parties. This data helps us to update, expand, and analyze our records, identify new customers, and identify Services that may be of interest to you. This may include purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties, that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and Services.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile App</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you download and use our Services, we may automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version and the device identifier (or “UDID”).</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within our mobile application we may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update the services, or to notify you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.</span></p>
			<p><b>How We Use Personal Data</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This section describes how Skytap uses the Personal Data that we collect to operate our business and to provide you our Services, including improvements to those Services and in the personalization of your experiences. We may also use the data to communicate with you, providing account information, security updates and Service information. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers. Additionally, data is used to market our Services, to comply with applicable laws and legal processes, to enforce our terms and conditions, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide a requested service or carry out a contract with you</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use data collected from you in the following ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Support: to diagnose and repair technical issues and provide other customer care and support services.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Notifications: to communicate Service and account notifications to you. For example, we may contact you by phone, email, or other means to inform you of account status, usage, and billing details, and to notify you when security updates are available.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security, Safety, and Dispute Resolution: to protect the security and safety of our Services and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing the Services: to carry out your transactions with us and to provide our Services to you, such as the account administration, authorization, and audit tools provided within our Services.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we have a legitimate interest</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use data collected from you in the following ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Personalization: to include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and user experience enjoyment, and automatically tailor your Service experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests, and locations. To better understand how to access and control the Personal Data collected for these types of processing, please see the </span><a href="#access-and-control"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access and Control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section below.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Operations: to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions about, and report on the performance of our business.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Improvement: to continually improve our Services, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features of our Services, and usage data to determine new features or Services to prioritize.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we rely on legitimate interest for processing your information, we carry out a ‘balancing test’ to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests, before we go ahead with such processing. You can find out more about the information in these balancing tests by contacting us using the details below.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we have your consent</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use data we collect to communicate with you in a variety of formats and to tailor those communications to you. Examples include inviting you to participate in surveys, email subscriptions, and promotional communications from Skytap by email, SMS, physical mail, or telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, please visit the </span><a href="#access-and-control"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access and Controls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section of this privacy statement.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated decision making</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap employs automated decision making (also known as “profiling”) in the processing of your data in very limited ways, and only in accordance with the specifications of this Policy and applicable laws. For example, we may auto-assign customer support personnel to respond to your inquiries, based on your organization or employer, and necessary details of that contract, or auto-assign a regional contact to assist you, based on your location. These actions are necessary to provide you with our Services and related support.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, some automated decision making is used, with your consent, to determine appropriate communications to you, as detailed above.</span></p>
			<p><b>Reasons We Share Personal Data</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This section describes how Skytap may share and disclose Personal Data. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of data, and Skytap does not control how they choose to share or disclose Information.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap may share your Personal Data with your consent, or as necessary to complete a transaction or provide a Service you have requested or authorized. For example:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you elect to use connected third-party applications, we may share Personal Data with companies who provide those applications. In those cases, we encourage you to review and understand the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties, over whom we have no control.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose generic, aggregated (pseudonymized) demographic information, not linked to any specific Data Subject, regarding Skytap visitors and users to our business partners, trusted affiliates, and suppliers or agents working on our behalf.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use third-party service providers to help us operate or administer the Services. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or to assist in protecting and securing our services and systems may need access to Personal Data to complete those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use Personal Data they receive from us for any other purpose.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose Personal Data to a third-party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we believe to be necessary or appropriate, we may disclose Personal Data: (a) under applicable laws, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with a subpoena or other legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>How We Protect Your Information</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap has adopted reasonable security measures to protect Personal Data against loss, theft, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access control, and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Skytap uses industry standard encryption to facilitate the exchange and transmission of data. Skytap only processes Personal Data in compliance with the purposes for which it has been collected, in accordance with this Policy.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that Personal Data is acquired by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification, we will promptly notify the affected Data Subject. Notice will be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and any measures necessary for Skytap or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of a system. Skytap may delay notification if we, or a law enforcement agency, determine that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. In such case, notification will not be provided unless and until we or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.</span></p>
			<p><b>Data Retention</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for us to use your information as described above or to comply with our legal obligations. Please be advised that this means that we may retain some of your information after you cease to use our Services. For instance, we may retain your data as necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as for tax and accounting purposes.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When determining the relevant retention periods, we take the following factors into account:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved;</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">our legitimate interest where we have carried out a balancing test;</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">statute of limitations under applicable law(s);</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">(potential) disputes;</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you have made a request to have your information deleted; and</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, we securely erase your information once this is no longer needed.</span></p>
			<p><b>Your Rights as a Data Subject</b></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a number of rights when it comes to your Personal Data. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.</span></p>

			<h4><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h4>
			<p>Skytap and our partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users‘ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies and similar technologies at the <a href="/how-to-manage-cookies/">individual browser level</a>. However, if you choose to disable any of these, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Below we have included additional information on the types of cookies and technologies that Skytap uses. To manage cookies and similar technologies for your browser, see our page on <a href="/how-to-manage-cookies/">How to Manage Cookies</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you that amount to a request for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. These cookies do not store any Personal Data.</li>
				<li>Performance Cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All of the information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore pseudonymous.

				<li>Functionality Cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization, such as playback of tutorial videos, and customer support chat functionality.

				<li>Targeting Cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by us or our advertising partners. They may be used to build a profile of your interests and show you content in which you may be interested. Generally, they do not store any Personal Data, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. However, we sometimes use these cookies to do individualized tracking down to the name for marketing purposes. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted content.

				<li>Other Similar Technologies: In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our Services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. If you block these at the browser level, you will experience less targeted content, and may also experience performance issues when visiting our website or using our Services.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>International Data Transfers</h4>
			<p>Skytap may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live. We deploy the following safeguards when transferring Personal Data originating from the European Union or Switzerland to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:</p>
			<h5>European Union Model Clauses</h5>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Skytap participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, unless and until EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is reinstated by the EU following invalidation by the EU Court, Skytap will rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses and the following is informational only.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap provides this notice and disclosure to comply with the CCPA, UK GDPR, and EU GDPR with regard to Personal Data collected related to applications for and actual employment on behalf of Skytap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCPA and both of the two GDPR’s (EU and UK) define the same subject matter, but using different terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information about individual people that the regulations protect are referred to by EU and UK GDPR as “Personal Data” and by CCPA as “Personal Information.” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disclosure for simplicity will use the GDPR term “Personal Data,”</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it applies equally to Personal Data under the EU and UK GDPR versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The individual persons who are and whose Personal Data are subject to protection under the EU and UK versions of GDPR are referred to under GDPR as “Data Subjects” and under CCPA as “Consumers.” </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disclosure for simplicity will use the GDPR term and refer to the individuals as “Data Subjects.”</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thus, references to Data Subjects in this disclosure will mean Consumers for purposes of CCPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under CCPA, the Personal Data identified in the Table below is shared with “Service Providers” who do not use the Personal Data for any purposes other than providing contracted services to Skytap, and Skytap’s Service Providers include employee benefits management companies, benefits providers, providers of payroll, human resources information systems, compensation benchmarking analytics providers, job applicant tracking software.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skytap retains the Personal Data below for a duration that depends on whether the Data Subject is only an applicant for employment or Skytap employs the Data Subject or an applicant that is not hired immediately for an open position might be suitable for a future open position. Certain categories of Personal Data are retained for longer durations if the potential exists to rehire the Data Subject after their employment with Skytap ends.</span></p>

Some service providers use APIs to pull data securely from Skytap systems, but not all of the data is usable for benchmarking purposes, and only usable data is anonymized or de-identified, and all of the raw data is promptly, and security destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Obtain and verify background checks on job applicants and employees *.</span></li>
