<p>The express waiver by DEEZER of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>

If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

<p>The express waiver by DEEZER of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>
<p>Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by DEEZER shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Service nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of DEEZER.</p></div>

<p><b>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</b></p>
<p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out <a href="http://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new">here</a>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Deezer Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms set forth above.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we may terminate your use of the Service.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3">Article 19 –  Assignment</h3>
<p>DEEZER may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the DEEZER Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy without DEEZER’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void and ineffective.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3">Article 20 –  Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service, any supplemental policies and any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein (including DEEZER’s Privacy Policy), contain the entire understanding of you and DEEZER, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and DEEZER with respect to the Deezer Service.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3">Article 21 –  No Waiver</h3>
<p>The failure of DEEZER to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of DEEZER’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>
<p>The express waiver by DEEZER of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>
<p>Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by DEEZER shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Service nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of DEEZER.</p>
