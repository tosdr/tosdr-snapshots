How We Use Information Collected Through Digital Citizenship Quizzes</strong></p><p>Quizzes provided by Common Sense Education are available at the end of each lesson in the Digital Citizenship Curriculum. Each quiz includes 4-6 questions that have varied formats: multiple choice, drag and drop to complete a sentence, and drag and drop sorting. The quiz is autograded and students can see their results immediately. The quizzes are intended to assess student understanding after the teacher has completed the corresponding lesson.</p><p>Common Sense quiz reports (for the entire class and individual student) are only accessible to a teacher who is authenticated with Google Classroom and who requests specific quiz reports on specified students authenticated with Google Classroom. Common Sense uses the data collected through Digital Citizenship Quizzes exclusively for the purpose of providing the CS Digital Curriculum services to the school districts using Common Sense's free online educational services. Common Sense works with the following third party service providers to provide Google Classroom integrated quizzes through the Digital Citizenship curriculum:</p><ul><li><strong>Learning Locker</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Learning Locker is a Learning Record Store (LRS) database-driven application and analytics tool designed specifically for the learning sector. Common Sense uses Learning Locker to store, sort and share data as recorded using the xAPI specification from Google Classroom. Learning Locker may collect and store the following information including, but not limited to: Google User ID, quiz_id, quiz name, start time, start date, quiz completion, stop time, stop date, quiz duration, quiz questions, alphanumeric answers, quiz grade, and quiz ranking. Please read Learning Locker’s <a class="link" href="https://www.ht2labs.com/privacy-policy/" target="_new">privacy policy</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Google Classroom</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google and part of the G Suite for Education to help schools streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students. Students using Google Classroom can view assignments, submit homework, and receive grades from teachers to help them stay on track and organized. The G Suite for Education core services are the heart of Google’s educational offering to schools. The core services include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts and Vault. Please read Google Classroom’s <a class="link" href="https://gsuite.google.com/terms/education_privacy.html" target="_new">privacy policy</a> for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The Google Classroom service provides Common Sense with a Google Classroom authenticated teacher’s class roster of student Google IDs. Only authenticated teachers can access student first and last names associated with Google IDs for quiz reporting purposes. Common Sense requests authorization from teachers to access their Google Classroom class roster of student Google IDs in order to combine all the specified student Google IDs present in the class roster with their respective Common Sense quiz submission data and quiz grades in order to generate class and individual student quiz reports for teachers. All quiz reports are generated on-demand by the Google Classroom authenticated teacher and are not stored or retained by Common Sense. When a teacher requests a "class roster" or individual “student” quiz report, Common Sense loads the teacher’s specified Google IDs from our third-party service provider Learning Locker and matches student IDs with Google Classroom to create and display a class roster quiz report for the entire class, or individual student report to produce a Google Classroom listing that includes student names paired with quiz scores.

If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your Personal Information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law (including the GDPR).</p><p><strong>What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data or you withdraw consent? </strong>Where we <em><strong><u>need</u></strong></em> to process your Personal Information either to comply with law, or to perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. Similarly, if we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, you are entitled to withdraw your consent, but if you do, we may not be able to provide certain services or features to you. We will keep you informed of when your access to service or features depends on your consent.</p><p><strong>Our newsletters</strong>. EEA+ Users who are Adult Members, and other EEA+ Users over the age of 18, can opt-in to receiving our newsletters. Please note, however, that you may continue to receive ‘service-related’ and other non-marketing emails from us, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or this Policy.</p><p><strong>How do you get consent from parents of Children when we are required to do so?</strong> We use the term "Children" to refer to younger kids for whom collecting parental consent is required under applicable laws. For example, under Article 8 of GDPR, when Personal Information is collected under the lawful base of consent (as provided by Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR) in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a Child parental consent is required. The age range that requires parental consent varies per Member State but in no event can be higher than 16 years of age. If parental consent is required in respect of any processing of a Children’s Personal Information, that Child must provide their parent’s email address. We use that email address to contact the Child’s parent to ask for their consent to the relevant processing – we also explain to the parent:</p><ul><li>what Personal Information we collect about their Child;</li><li>how we use it and why; and&nbsp;</li><li>how the parent can revoke their consent and/or ask that we delete their Child’s Profile and their Personal Information.</li></ul><p>If at this stage, the parent gives us their consent, we will carry out the processing. If not, we won’t.</p><p><strong>What rights do EEA+ parents have? </strong>If you are a parent of a Child who is an EEA+ User, and we need your consent to certain processing of your Child’s Personal Information, please contact us if you:</p><ul><li>believe your Child is participating in an activity on the Services that uses their Personal Information without the parental consent required by law; and/or</li><li>no longer wish for your Child to participate as a member of the Services,</li></ul><p>We will delete your Child’s Profile, and any parental contact information we may hold, on request. If you wish to exercise these rights, you can do so through our Privacy Requests Portal.</p><p id="Personal-Data-from-Third-Party-Sources"><strong>Personal Information from Third Party Sources.</strong> In addition to the Personal Information that we collect directly from you we also collect certain of your Personal Information from the following categories of third party:</p><ul><li>Single Sign-On providers – we may receive certain Identity Data, Contact Data, and Service Personalization Data relating to Educator Members who register for, and access the Services using, a Single Sign-On Service.</li><li>Fundraising Tools – we derive or receive Donor Analysis Data from certain commercial- and publicly-available sources, which we use to enrich the profiles of our current and prospective donors (example of such data sources are the iWaves PROscores, CoreLogic, VeriGift, Larkspur Data databases).</li></ul><p><strong>International transfers</strong>. We are headquartered in the United States. The Personal Information that we collect from and about you will be stored and processed in the United States and may be stored and processed in other countries outside of the EEA+. However, it is our policy to ensure that adequate contractual or other safeguards are applied to Personal Information transferred outside of the EEA+ where required by the GDPR. If you have questions about the safeguards applied to your Personal Information, you may contact us at <a class="link" href="https://commonsense.force.com/membersupport/s/contactsupport" target="_new">Contact Support</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id="Glossary"><strong>GLOSSARY</strong></p><p>The capitalized terms used throughout this Policy have the following meanings:</p><p><strong>Apps:</strong> All other Common Sense Media applications that link to this Privacy Policy beyond <a href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org">www.commonsensemedia.org</a>.</p><p><strong>Controller:</strong> The physical or legal person determining the purposes and means of collecting and processing Personal Information.</p><p><strong>Data Incident Response Plan: </strong>A Common Sense Media internal plan outlining the steps to respond to incidents that may compromise the security of Personal Information.</p><p><strong>Privacy Policy or Policy:</strong> This legal document which discloses how we collect or receive, use, store, and manage Personal Information, and what your choices and rights are over your it. Profile: The account profile you create to use our Services.</p><p><strong>Single Sign-On Service:</strong> A third-party account of yours (e.g., your Google account) that you select for open authentication into our Services instead of you creating and using a password to log into the Services.</p><p><strong>Services:</strong> The Common Sense Media website, <a href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org">www.commonsensemedia.org</a>, and all other applications, services, and websites that link to this Privacy Policy. Terms of Use: Our disclaimer and agreement for users of our Services.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> Visitors who complete the membership registration process through our Services. Members join an active and vibrant community of families and educators interested in the impact of media on their children and students and can engage in activities not available to Non-Members, such as creating user reviews on media products, participating in surveys and polls, and saving favorites to a personal page. If you are not currently a Member, you may <a class="link" href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/user/register">click here</a> to register, or <a class="link" href="https://www.commonsense.org/user/register">here</a> if you are an educator, and become eligible for our Services' features. You can also subscribe to Common Sense Media, which gives you one year of unlimited access to all our media ratings and reviews.</p><p><strong>Visitors:</strong> Individuals who visit our Services but who do not complete the membership registration process.</p><p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Information about an identified or identifiable natural person.

Child or Children: Younger kids for whom collecting parental consent is required under applicable laws. For example under COPPA in the United States, children for these purposes are considered to be individuals under the age of 13. This age range may vary in other countries and regions. Where consent is required or recommended for a particular purpose or practice, we aim to get parental consent for youth in accordance with the age designated by the country they are in.</p><p><strong>Teen:</strong> Older kids for whom collecting parental consent is not required under applicable laws. In the U.S. a Teen would be a kid that is 13 or older yet under 18. This age range may vary in other countries and regions, but in all cases, an individual over 18 is not considered a Teen.</p><p><strong>GDPR:</strong> The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the so-called ‘UK GDPR’</p></div>
