Site and App. Laws regarding the sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages are complex and constantly changing. The politics, policies and procedures regarding such sales and transportation are different in every state. That being said, title to the alcoholic beverages passes to you upon purchase in either California, Arizona or Washington. In the event that BevMo! may ship wine or other alcoholic beverages to your state in accordance with a state privilege requiring the payment of state taxes, you will be charged the state taxes (including the sales tax), if any, assessed by your state for that transaction; otherwise either California, Arizona or Washington sales tax will be assessed on the sale. Title to all product intended for shipment to federal property and Indian reservations passes to the customer when the goods are picked up by the common carrier, and California sales tax will be collected on all such purchases. When your order is approved by your credit card company, you own the goods. If you choose shipping as a delivery method, you are asking us to engage a common carrier to deliver your order to you. We make no representations about the legality of shipping alcoholic beverages. Our Site lists those states where common carriers will deliver alcohol. You are responsible for compliance with all laws regarding such shipments. Please note that customers in Washington or Arizona who place orders of alcoholic beverages for shipment within the state will have their orders fulfilled from one of our in-state retail locations and will be charged state tax accordingly.</span></div><div dir="auto" class="css-146c3p1 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="margin-bottom:12px;text-align:left;color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">By arranging for transportation of the alcoholic beverages, BevMo! is providing a service to, and acting on behalf of you.

In such case, you agree to reimburse Gopuff for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Gopuff will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the paragraph below. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CURRENT OR FORMER USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OR OTHER ENTITY. To the maximum extent allowable by law, the Parties mutually agree that by entering into this Arbitration Provision, both Parties waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action, whether in court or in arbitration, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action or to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration (“Class Action Waiver”).  The Parties agree that the definition of a “class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which You are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed more than 25 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against Gopuff within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on Your behalf, and the law firm or collective of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands together.  If more than 25 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature are filed against Gopuff by the same law firm or collection of law firms within 180 days of one another, each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved in an individual manner.  This Class Action Wavier does not prevent You or Gopuff from participating in a classwide settlement of claims.  Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Arbitration Provision or the Agreement, any claim in court or arbitration that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, voidable, or has been breached, shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that remains enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. Gopuff may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver and seek dismissal of such class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass actions or claims.  The Class Action Waiver shall be severable in any case in which the severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.</span></div><div dir="auto" class="css-146c3p1 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="margin-bottom:12px;text-align:left;color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">Notwithstanding the foregoing, we also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. </span></div><div dir="auto" class="css-146c3p1 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="margin-bottom:12px;text-align:left;color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s r-u4uko3" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s r-u4uko3" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">Contact</span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">.  If you are having difficulty accessing or navigating the Sites or Apps or have other questions about the Services, please send an e-mail to support@gopuff.com.</span></div><div dir="auto" class="css-146c3p1 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="margin-bottom:12px;text-align:left;color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s r-u4uko3" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s r-u4uko3" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">Applicable Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction</span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-t3ofa r-1vzmqqg r-13uqrnb r-1it3c9n r-crgep1 r-ddtstp r-t60dpp r-1hspf76 r-1i10wst r-iu7p7s" style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1.00)">.

This Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by Gopuff but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of Gopuff. If any provision hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions will not have been inserted herein; provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired. It is expressly understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party’s performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.
