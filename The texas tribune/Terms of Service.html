      <p><strong>Our Content</strong>. The Service contains content of The Texas Tribune or our licensors (<q><strong>Our Content</strong></q> and, collectively with User Content (defined below), the <q><strong>Content</strong></q>).

For example, without the right to modify User Content, The Texas Tribune would not be able to digitally compress uploaded files that Registered Users submit or otherwise format User Content to satisfy technical requirements, and without the right to publicly perform User Content, The Texas Tribune could not allow Users to access content posted by Registered Users.

  <li>
    <p><strong>Disputes Among Users</strong>. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. The Texas Tribune reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Governing Law; Disputes with The Texas Tribune; Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>. This Agreement and the relationship between you and The Texas Tribune shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to its conflict of law provisions that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction and you agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of the United States located in the City of Austin, Texas.
    </p>
    <p>The Texas Tribune is the sole determiner in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of our rules and any decision we make relating to termination of a Registered User account shall be final and binding. The Texas Tribune reserves the right to exercise any legal remedy to recover damages for a breach or contravention of the terms hereof.
    </p>
    <p>Either The Texas Tribune or you may demand that any dispute between us about or involving the Service must be settled by binding arbitration utilizing the dispute resolution procedures of the American Arbitration Association (<q><strong>AAA</strong></q>) in Austin, Texas, USA, provided that the foregoing shall not prevent The Texas Tribune from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. In such event, you and The Texas Tribune agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes relating to your use of the Service under the rules of the AAA. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.
    </p>
    <p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with the Released Parties arising out of or relating to your use of the Service or this Agreement:

    <p><strong>Intellectual Property Policy. </strong>The Texas Tribune respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service. The Texas Tribune's intellectual property policy is to (a) remove material that The Texas Tribune believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service, and (b) remove any User Content posted to the Service by <q>repeat infringers.</q> The Texas Tribune considers a <q>repeat infringer</q> to be any User that has uploaded User Content to the Service and for whom The Texas Tribune has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(c) with respect to such User Content. The Texas Tribune has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon The Texas Tribune's own determination.
    </p>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the <q><strong>DMCA</strong></q>) provides recourse for intellectual property owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Service infringe your intellectual property rights, you (or your agent) may send The Texas Tribune a <q>Notification of Claimed Infringement</q> requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;</li></p>
      <li><p>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</p></li>
      <li><p>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow The Texas Tribune to locate the material on the Service;</p></li>
      <li><p>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);</p></li>
      <li><p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p></li>
      <li><p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send The Texas Tribune a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href= "https://www.copyright.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.copyright.gov/</a> for details.
