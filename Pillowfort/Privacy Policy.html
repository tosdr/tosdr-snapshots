	<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing that personal information.</li>
	<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>

</ul>

<p>If we shared your personal information for a business purpose, a list of those disclosures, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>
<p><em>Deletion Request Rights</em>: You have the right under the CCPA to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

	<li> Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information&rsquo;s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research&rsquo;s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
	<li> Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
	<li> Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	<li> Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>: To exercise these access, data portability, and deletion rights under the CCPA, please submit a verifiable request to us by sending a message to info@pillowfort.social. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable request must:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Provide enough information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
	<li> Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to confirm the requestor&rsquo;s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p><em>Response Timing and </em>Format: We will try to respond to a verifiable request 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable request&rsquo;s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em>: Pillowfort does not sell your personal information.</p>
<p><em>Non-Discrimination </em>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not (i) deny you services or (ii) provide you a different level of service.</p>
<p><em>California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law (Civil Code Section &sect; 1798.83)</em>: This law permits employees that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email info@pillowfort.social.</p>
