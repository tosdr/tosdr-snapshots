of Service</h1><p>Effective November 11, 2013</p><p>Thank you for visiting Printfection. The following Terms of Service (\u201CTOS\u201D) are a legal agreement between you and Printfection, LLC (\u201CPrintfection\u201D, \u201Cwe\u201D or \u201Cus\u201D) concerning your use of the website located at www.Printfection.com (the \u201CWeb Site\u201D). Your use of the Web Site or the services made available through the Web Site (the \u201CServices\u201D) constitutes your acceptance of these TOS. If you do not agree to these TOS, you are not permitted to access the Web Site or to use the Services.</p><h2>1. Services</h2><p>Printfection offers a variety of services, which may include (but may not be limited to) the following.</p><p><span>Custom Merchandise</span>. Through the Web Site you may customize merchandise such as apparel, drink coasters, mouse pads and other merchandise (the \u201CItems\u201D) with the artwork you choose. This customized merchandise will be referred to in these TOS as \u201CCustom Merchandise\u201D. Printfection may allow you to store your Custom Merchandise designs on the Web Site, but Printfection may remove such designs at any time in its sole discretion.</p><p><span>Physical Merchandise</span>. You may choose to send us your merchandise or purchase Custom Merchandise for us to store and fulfill upon your request which will be referred to in these TOS as \u201CPhysical Merchandise\u201D. If you send us your merchandise we will present it on the Web Site as Custom Merchandise for you to manage.</p><p><span>Fulfillment Services</span>. We will store your Physical Merchandise and drop-ship it, at your cost, directly to the location of your choice. All shipments of Physical Merchandise will be shipped Ex Works (Incoterms 2010) at a facility of our choice. While we do not plan to dispose of Physical Merchandise, we cannot store it indefinitely. If we, in our sole discretion, decide to stop storing your Physical Merchandise, we will provide you with at least 60 days\u2019 (10 days\u2019 in the event these TOS are terminated) notice (the \u201CNotice Period\u201D). At any time during the Notice Period you may direct us to ship your Physical Merchandise, at your cost, to you or to the person or company of your choice. If the Notice Period expires and you have not directed us to ship your Physical Merchandise, your Physical Merchandise will be considered abandoned and we may dispose of your Physical Merchandise in our sole discretion.</p><p><span>Store</span>. Printfection also offers services that allow its users to sell their Custom Merchandise through their own on-line store contained on the Web Site (\u201CStore\u201D). Users who would like to establish a Store must enter into a separate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.printfection.com/help/store-owner-agreement/\">Store Owner Agreement</a>.</p><p><span>Other Services</span>. Printfection may, at its option offer a number of other additional services in the future through its Web Site, such as message boards or newsletters. If additional services are offered, Printfection may in its sole discretion adopt additional rules, regulations or terms of service concerning the additional services.</p><p>1.1 Sending Us Merchandise. &nbsp;If you send us Physical Merchandise, whether strictly for custom printing or for the Fulfillment Services, you shall not send any live animals, chemicals, explosives, hazardous materials, illegal drugs, illegal merchandise, or any other items that may be considered harmful, illegal, or a violation of applicable laws, regulations or policies of common carriers. &nbsp;You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to send us such merchandise and to have us perform the Services requested for the same. &nbsp;You shall be solely responsible for all taxes (including without limitation use taxes), duties, tariffs and other similar charges related to the sending, storage, use and/or sale of Physical Merchandise. &nbsp;You shall indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs, claims, fines, and penalties suffered by us, including consequential damages, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and all costs of litigation, arising out of your violation of this Section.</p><p>1.2 Ownership and Risk of Loss. Between you and us, you are, and will remain at all times, the sole owner of your Physical Merchandise. If you purchase Physical Merchandise from Printfection, title to such Physical Merchandise shall pass to you when such Physical Merchandise is displayed on your account on the Web Site as available to be drop-shipped to the location of your choice.&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this Section, you bear all risk of loss of your Physical Merchandise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your Physical Merchandise is lost, stolen, destroyed, damaged, or unaccounted for solely due to the grossly negligent or willful acts of Printfection or any of its personnel (\u201CLost Merchandise\u201D) we will replace the Lost Merchandise or reimburse you for the reasonable replacement cost of the Lost Merchandise, in our sole discretion.</p><h2>2. License for Services and Web Site</h2><p>Printfection grants you a personal, non-transferable, limited, revocable license to access and use the Web Site and the Services for their intended purposes only, subject to your compliance with these TOS.
