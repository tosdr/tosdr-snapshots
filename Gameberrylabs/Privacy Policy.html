    <h4 class="content-heading gb-h-common gb-violet-text">YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US</h4>
    <p>Your privacy is important to Gameberry Labs Private Limited or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
      (collectively “Gameberry” “we”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, process, use, share and
      protect information about you.</p>
    <p>The Privacy Policy covers both “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including any websites operated by us,
      however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g.,
      collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, provided, or made
      available by us. </p>
    <p>Our “online” and “offline” activities, in relation to Gameberry's social games and related services, which
      include applications for mobile devices and Gameberry branded websites are collectively referenced as the
      “Services”. This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of interactive features or downloads that: (i) we own or
      control; (ii) are available through the Services; or (iii) interact with the Services and post or incorporate this
      Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service. BY VISITING THIS WEBSITE YOU AGREE
      TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change at any
      time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically. By mere
      use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance
      with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use or access our Website or
      use our Services.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through email address provided on our website

        various means and in various places through the Services, including online account registration forms, contact
        us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you create a user
        profile. When you identify yourself on Gameberry site, you may identify yourself through a social network
        account in which Gameberry may receive additional information about your profile. We shall ask you to provide
        only such Personal Information which is for lawful purpose connected with our Services and necessary to be
        collected by us for such purpose.<br />The data fields that might be requested for and collected currently, are:

      <li>Any information shared with us by third Party websites using which you have created an account on our
        Platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we may use a
        variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or
        interact with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include information regarding
        the browser that you are using, geo-location, IP address, country, the URL that referred you to our Services
        (source), all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information
        in order to gauge your “behaviour” on our Platform and provide you enhanced and more customised Services.
        For our internal reports and recommendations, we may collect aggregate information about the use of the
        Service, including information about users accessing the Gameberry site, using our Services, using SNS Apps
        on other sites or using Mobile Apps, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language,
        referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names,
        landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and
        the date and time (“Activity Information”).</li>
      <li>In addition, we collect your Device Identifier for your Device. A Device Identifier is a number that is
        automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by
        its Device Identifier. It is peculiar and exclusive to you. Further, when you invite new members into your
        network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers, the information
        associated with those messages, including email addresses and content, amongst other details. Your carrier’s
        standard fees and rates will still apply, including without limitation SMS/text messaging fees, and you
        accept responsibility for all charges.</li>
      <li>Usage Information may be collected using a cookie. If you do not want information to be collected through
        the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or
        controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable
        cookies or flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not
        be able to customize the delivery of information to you. The Company cannot control the use of cookies (or
        the resulting information) by third parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy
        Policy. Any other third party marketing or technology service that may be tracking your use of our Services
        shall not be covered by our policies and we shall not be liable for the same. </li>
      <li>We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age,
        occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social
        networking systems on which you have used our Services, which would also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
        Further, when you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else’s page, we
        may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is
        visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.
        Note that since most of our Services are served through SNS Apps, it is solely your responsibility to read
        and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you
        through our website or Services with outside records from third parties, upon your authorisation. Further, most
        content delivered through our Services originates with another content provider. Such other content providers
        may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to
        provide information through the site itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our Services are primarily provided through the Mobile Application. We may collect and use technical data

        Service usage and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the
        provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile

        communication as long as you are using our Platform and/or Services.</li>
      <li>We may use the information obtained from you to prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy
        Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to investigate fraud,

      <li>We also use your Personal Information or Usage Information and certain technical information about your
        computer and your access of the Service (including your IP address) in order to operate, manage and maintain the

        particular individual on websites other than our web site(s). The information collected is only linked to an
        anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a
        particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number.</li>
      <li>With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide updates and relevant
        messages. We may also send local notifications to your mobile device. You may manage notifications from the
        “Settings” page of the Mobile App or through your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="content-heading gb-h-common gb-violet-text">CONTROL OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object on how we use or share your data,
        and restrict how we use or share your data. You can always withdraw your consent. We will respond to all
        requests within a reasonable timeframe. </li>
      <li>If you wish to exercise any of your data subject rights described above, please provide an intimation to the

      your account, after ascertaining your identity, within a reasonable period of time.</p>
    <h4 class="content-heading gb-h-common gb-violet-text">HOW AND WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD-PARTIES</h4>
    <p>We do not sell, share, rent or trade the information we have collected about you, other than as disclosed within
      this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide your information. Following are the situations when information may
      be shared:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WHEN YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES: You may be presented with an opportunity to receive
        information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties. If you do agree to have your Personal
        Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third parties and all information you
        disclose will be subject to the Privacy Policy and practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for
        the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies
        and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from them. If you later decide
        that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party
        directly. </li>
      <li>THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING SERVICES ON OUR BEHALF: We sometimes use third party companies and individuals to
        facilitate our Services, provide or perform certain aspects of the Services on our behalf – such as other
        content provider to provide the Services, other third parties to host the Services, design and/or operate the
        Services’ features, track the Services’ analytics, process payments, engage in anti-fraud and security measures,
        provide customer support, enable us to send you special offers, perform technical services (e.g., without
        limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services‘ features),
        or perform other administrative services. These third parties will have access to user information, including
        Personal Information to only carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Each of these third
        parties are required to ensure the same level of data protection as us and are obligated not to disclose or use
        Personal Information for any other purpose.<br />Content providers may set and access their own cookies, web
        beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about
        you, including non-personally identifiable information. We use a third party hosting provider who hosts our
        support section of our website. Information collected within this section of our website by such third party is
        governed by our Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li>CO-BRANDED SERVICES: Certain aspects of the Services may be provided to you in association with third parties
        (“Co-Branded Services”) such as sponsors and charities, and may require you to disclose Personal Information to
        them. Such Co-Branded Services will identify the third party. If you elect to register for products and/or
        services through the Co-Branded Services, you shall have deemed to consent to providing your information to both
        us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Service with a username and password obtained
        through our Services, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that
        Co-Branded Service and will be subject to their posted privacy policies.</li>
      <li>CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may offer Promotions through the Services that may require registration. We will share details and information
      about each of these contests and promotions and their specific terms along with the announcement of the same. By
      participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain
      specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or
      likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, you agree
      that your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the
      administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, and as
      required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REASONS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We cooperate with Government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the
      law. Thus, we may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Personal Information,
      IP address, Device Information or geo-location data), to Government or law enforcement officials or private
      parties as we reasonably determine is necessary and appropriate: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
      subpoenas, Governmental requests or legal process; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Terms and Conditions for
      online and mobile Services or other policies applicable to any online and mobile Services, including investigation
      of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Company, our
      Services or any third party; (iv) to protect the safety of the public for any reason; (v) to detect, prevent or
      otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and /or (vi) to prevent or stop activity we may consider to
      be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WHEN YOU SHARE INFORMATION</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Personal Information may be collected and shared with third-parties if there is content from the Mobile
      Application that you specifically and knowingly upload to, share with or transmit to an email recipient, online
      community, website, or to the public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or information about you

    <ul>
      <li>BUSINESS TRANSFER</li>
    </ul>
