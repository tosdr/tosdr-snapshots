            policies, Gameberry grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited licence subject to the
            limitations in these T&amp;Cs to access and use the Service using a Gameberry supported web browser (such as

            entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose, directly or indirectly, in
            any manner whatsoever.</p>
        <p>You understand that while at times you may “earn” &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;purchase&quot; (a) virtual

            or (b) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency, &quot;Virtual Items&quot;); these real world

            purchase a limited licence to use the Service, including software programs that occasionally manifest
            themselves as these items. The purchase and sale of the limited licence referred to in these T&amp;Cs is a
            completed transaction upon receipt of your direct payment or redemption of a Gameberry game card or a third
            party virtual currency like Facebook Credits. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH

            it and the same can only and solely be used on the Platform for defined and described Services. Gameberry
            may limit the total amount of Virtual Items that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total
            amount of Virtual Items that may be held in your account in the aggregate.</p>
        <p>Gameberry has the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Items, and/or the Services, or
            any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual
            Items, and you have an active application on your device, we will attempt to provide notice to you through
            the Services or through other communications. In case you do not have an active application, at the time of
            an update or feature notification, you may not receive the intimation of such update or notification when
            you start using the application again.</p>

            <li>PURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD PARTY VIRTUAL CURRENCY TO ACQUIRE A LICENSE TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE
                NON-REFUNDABLE.</li>
            <li>You can license Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games, providing your billing
                information, confirming the particulars of your purchase and re-affirming your agreement to these Terms.
                When you purchase a license to Virtual Items from our Service, We may send you a confirmatory e-mail
                that will contain details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the
                confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and maintain a copy of it for your records.
                Gameberry keeps records of transactions in order to deal with any subsequent queries. For instance, you
                purchase Credits from third party apps/stores such as Facebook, Google Play Store and Apple App Store
                etc., you are agreeing to their Payment Terms and Gameberry is not a party to the transaction. You are
                requested to read their Payment Terms before making any transaction. </li>
            <li>For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to purchase a license for the relevant
                service(s) which will be accepted by us when We make the Virtual Items available in your account for you
                to use in our games or debit your credit card, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>Your license to Virtual Items for use in Gameberry games is a service provided by Gameberry that
                commences upon acceptance by Gameberry of your purchase or redemption of third party virtual currency.
                By ordering a license to use Virtual Items you agree and accept that Gameberry will provide it to you
                promptly following completion of your purchase. If you reside in the European Union and you purchase a
                product or service from Gameberry, you may have the right to withdraw from a purchase within seven
                calendar days, commencing on the day after the date of purchase (the &quot;Cooling Off Period&quot;).
                However, you lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of the services begins before the end of
                the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly, please note that if you purchase a license to use Virtual Items
                from Us, your right of withdrawal is lost as the performance of our services begins promptly once your
                purchase is completed.</li>
            <li>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to
                you. Gameberry may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Service
                at any time. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GAMEBERRY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT
            RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE
            WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certain minimums may apply to purchases of Virtual Items and certain maximums may apply depending on
                your transaction method. Gameberry reserves the right to change the maximum and minimum amounts
                applicable to purchase the Virtual Items at any time without notice, consisten with applicable law.</li>
            <li>Gameberry may provide you with an option in certain Services wherein you may be allowed to transfer the
                permitted Virtual Items owned by you to other users. However, this option may only be granted by
                Gameberry upon their discretion, who also holds the right to make any changes in this option including
                but not limited to the type of Virtual Items which can be transferred, the limit on such transfer, the
                accounts to which it can be transferred and the manner in which the Virtual Items can be transferred.
                The decision of Gameberry will be final and no request for any review/appeal will be entertained. </li>
            <li>You may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell<a
                    href="https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/virtual-items"> Virtual Items</a> for real money, or
                exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of the Services, without Gameberry’s written
                permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void and will subject your account
                to termination.</li>
            <li>The ownership of these Virtual Items shall belong to you on the Platform and can only be transferred
                IN-APP to another registered User on the Platform. However, at all times Gameberry owns all vested and
                inherent IPs and proprietary rights in such Virtual Items. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="content-heading gb-h-common gb-violet-text">REWARDS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Gameberry may offer one or more rewards (“Rewards”) through specific activities such as advertisements,
                games, surveys, quizzes etc. (“Activities”), wherein the users may be able to either earn points, which
                can
                be redeemed for Rewards or the users may directly receive the Rewards.</li>
            <li>Not all of Gameberry’s Activities will carry Rewards. Some of the Activities may include additional
                terms
                that apply to your participation in the Activities allowing you to earn points or Rewards. Points
                awarded
                have no cash value.</li>
            <li>Gameberry may limit, suspend or terminate Your ability to participate in Activities in its sole and
                absolute discretion, and may void any points, Rewards, or potential Rewards you may have earned or
                accumulated, if Gameberry determines in its sole discretion that You have not complied with these Terms
                or
                any additional terms applicable to such participation. The decision tendered by Gameberry in this regard
                will be final and binding on You.</li>
            <li>Gameberry reserves the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of the Activities,
                including
                any points or Rewards You may have accrued, at any time. Gameberry will generally use reasonable efforts
                to
                provide notice to You of any material change to or a suspension or cancellation of the Activities;
                however,
                this may not always be possible. </li>
            <li>There may be limitations on Activities and Rewards, so please be sure to review all applicable
                additional
                terms before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. Gameberry reserves the right to
                amend
                these limitations at any time without giving any notice.</li>
            <li>If You attempt to redeem points for a reward and Gameberry determines that the reward is unavailable,
                out
                of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to You, Gameberry may, at its sole and absolute
                discretion, provide you with a reward of equal or greater value. No credit, reversal, or refund of
                points
                will be issued for any reason after points have been redeemed; in other words, once you order a reward,
                you
                may not cancel the reward or return the reward for a refund of points.</li>
            <li>Rewards and/or earned points are non-transferable, may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a
                transfer
                is attempted.</li>
            <li>Any Account that has not been logged into and points either earned or redeemed for one year or more
                may be
                deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may either close the Account completely or remove any points
                in
                the Account and treat it as inactive, as we elect. </li>
            <li>Any points or Rewards that have not been redeemed for two (2) years from the time such points were
                earned
                or awarded may be deemed expired and removed from your Account. Gameberry will not recredit any earned
                pointed or re-offer you the reward so earned.</li>
            <li>We may modify the foregoing points expiration rules and policies at anytime. </li>
