                    <p>In the modern connected world, privacy is a huge concern. Companies and governments collect your information and activities in order to create profiles about you and sell information about you to advertisers. I believe that you should have full control over your information, which is why privacy is one of the main aspects I aim to achieve with V0LT. On this page I'll explain how V0LT protects your privacy, how your information is handled, and what you can do to independently verify the claims made.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Analytics</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> The V0LT website uses simple page-load analytics to determine how many users visit certain pages. These metrics include basic information like device screen size, operating system, and country of origin. V0LT does not profile or track individual users.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> V0LT uses Plausible analytics, which is free and open source software. You can inspect the source code yourself <a class="hyperlink" href="https://plausible.io/">here</a>!</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Third Party Services</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> The V0LT website does not make requests to any third-party services.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> This can be verified using the network monitoring functionality found in the developer tools of most modern browsers.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Open Source</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> All new V0LT programs are open source, which means anyone can read the code that makes them work. However, there are older V0LT programs that are closed source, so keep in mind that these are much harder to verify when it comes to privacy claims.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> Visit the page of the program that you want to verify, then scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you'll find a 'Downloads' section. Along side various versions of the program, you should find an archive of the source code.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Password Hashing</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> When you sign up for a V0LT account, your username is stored in plain text. Your password, on the other hand, is 'hashed', meaning it is unreversably scrambled. Whenever you sign in, the password you enter is re-hashed, and compared against the one stored in the account database. As such, your plain text password is never stored.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> Unfortunately, this can't be independently verified, since doing so would require direct access to the V0LT account database. However, behind the scenes, V0LT uses a modified version of <a class="hyperlink" href="https://v0lttech.com/dropauth.php">DropAuth</a> for authentication, which is completely open source and freely auditable.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Breach Notification</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> In the event that there is a critical security incident relating to V0LT, a prominent notice will be placed on the main landing page of the V0LT website. This notice will link to a PGP signed text document explaining the breach and any other relevant information.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> Unfortunately, it is difficult to independently verify this, since there is often no way to tell from the outside when a security incident has occured.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Viewing Your Information</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> To view all information associated with your V0LT account, visit your account settings, then press "View Information".</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> While it is difficult to independently verify that the information displayed is truly all of the information associated with your V0LT account, you should be able to compare the information you've entered into V0LT web services with the information returned by the account information page.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">Deleting Your Information</p>
                    <p><b>Description:</b> To delete your V0LT account and it's associated information, visit your account settings, then press "Delete Account". You'll be prompted to confirm the deletion. After confirmation, your personal information will be erased in a matter of seconds. Please note that this process is irreversable.</p>
                    <p><b>Verification:</b> After deleting your account, you'll be signed out of V0LT. To verify successful deletion, attempt to login with your old account. You should find that the account no longer exists. For even further verification, feel free to contact V0LT and request that your account deletion be manually verified.</p>
                    
                    <p class="subtitle">Contact</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions about your data, V0LT's security measures, or other privacy practices, you can contact V0LT using the information found <a href="/contact.php" class="hyperlink">here</a>.</p>
