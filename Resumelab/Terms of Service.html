<p><strong>8. Additional Services, Resume Posting Services, Job Alerts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Resume Posting</strong></p>
<p>We provide resume and curriculum vitae building services and tools. In addition, our &ldquo;Resume Posting Services&rdquo; may facilitate the posting of your resume or a career profile on various third-party career sites. If you sign up for our Resume Posting Services, you agree that we will use proprietary web-based information gathering tools to create a career profile for you. You further agree that the wording and interpretation of your information for purposes of Resume Posting Services will be in our sole discretion and we will not be liable for any decisions to include, not include or phrase information about you as part of the Resume Posting Services. You understand, and consent to, that prior to posting of your career profile or resume on a third-party career site, Provider will be accepting terms and conditions of use and privacy policies, and other policies that it might be prompted to accept, on these third-party career sites. You may check the third-party sites where we may post your information to see their terms and conditions of use and privacy policies. By using our Resume Posting Services you're accepting full and total responsibility for the actions Provider performs on your behalf and at your request as if you had performed those actions yourself. You further acknowledge and agree that you will take full responsibility and are personally liable for any consequences arising from your use of the Resume Posting Services.</p>
<p>Provider may also offer job posting and resume submission features as part of the Service in certain locations or jurisdictions. These features may be used only by individuals seeking employment and/or career information. In the same vein, certain Provider services may only be used by employers seeking employees.</p>
<p>Depending on your location or jurisdiction, Provider may provide job alerts or may use third parties and automated search engines to provide job alerts, matching employment opportunities found on third-party job searching sites with your resume or career profile, job search requests submitted by you, and/or other usage data relating to your use of the Service. Provider tries to match the information available to ensure employment opportunities presented to you in job alerts and match the type of career opportunities desired by you but Provider makes no guarantee that you will receive career opportunities or the job alert leads you desire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Resume Parsing</strong></p>
<p>Provider may also offer additional services that may help you in your application process, such as tracking your resume and facilitating the transfer and interpretation of your resume data by the third-parties involved in your application process (&ldquo;Resume Parsing&rdquo;). Upon downloading your resume, you agree that Provider may include a metadata and an identifier into your resume and share it with third-parties such as parsing companies, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and employers for the purpose of facilitating your application process and allowing such third parties, through technology, capture your data, process it, and deliver it to the prospective employer to whom you have submitted a job application.</p>
<p>To see if your resume has been parsed, please go to your Resume Insights page in your Account. Your Resume Insights page may give you data regarding your Resume Parsing activities, which may include (when available) the number of times your resume has been &lsquo;parsed&rsquo;, dates, and location. Note that all of this information may not always be available. Due to privacy, we are not able to give you the name of the person, entity or third party who is parsing your resume. We do not guarantee the accuracy of the information on your Resume Insights page, nor the time or the location displayed on your Resume Insight page, as some people may be using blockers or VPNs to avoid tracking technologies such as the one in your Resume Parsing service. Each time the third party performs a parsing function over your resume, such activity will be automatically featured on the Resume Insights page and will show the user with the total number of parsing activities for your unique downloaded resume, which carries a specific document id. Your resume may be parsed multiple times within a single application process. Therefore, note that the number of parsing activities in your Resume Insight page is not indicative that different third-parties or employers have parsed or viewed your resume. We encourage you to download multiple resumes to capture on each a unique ID in order to help you track the activities of each of such resumes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also enable a notification system to notify you when your resume has been parsed, which we may do by email or text, should such service become available. Such notifications shall be made (when available) under the terms and conditions contained herein applicable to notifications to our subscribers. You acknowledge that the actual time between a parsing activity over your resume and the time the notification is sent to you on a number of factors, including your wireless service and coverage within the area in which you are located at that time, and that such notices may be delayed, experience delivery failures, or face other transmission problems. Email notices may be affected by Internet outages and other problems impacting the transmission and receipt of email messages.</p>
<p>You may always opt out of the Resume Parsing services and from receiving these notifications. To opt-out please visit your Resume Insights page or contact customer service. The Provider makes no guarantee that you will receive career opportunities or that the notices of Resume Parsing services will meet your requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please remember that the Resume Parsing services will only become available if you download the resume from this site and share your resume with third parties as part of your application process. The Resume Parsing service is not triggered by Provider and is only triggered upon your direct sharing of your resume with third-parties that are enabled with the parsing technology necessary to process the Resume Parsing services. By sharing your resume with third parties, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>

Please note that once you send the link to your resume with request to provide comments, we cannot guarantee any other person than Feedback Provider will not have access to your resume, as we have no control on how the Feedback Provider uses the link you share. Due to privacy purposes you can disactivate the link to your resume manually at any time. The link will also expire once you deactivate or delete your Account. However, once you send a link of your resume, it may have been already previously accessed, stored, and/or copied by others, and therefore, we are unable to delete the information from their systems. By sending a link of your resume you do so at your own risk. If you are providing comments to the resume shared to you, thus you are acting as a Feedback Provider. As a Feedback Provider you understand that you can use the link to the resume shared by one of our users solely for the purpose of providing comments on the content of the user&rsquo;s resume. You take full responsibility for an use of the received link for any other purpose or against a will of the user. Furthermore, you acknowledge that Provider has no obligation to pre-screen your comments. However, Provider reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, alter or remove any comment. We may use the comment for any purpose we believe is necessary, especially to improve our service, for marketing services or testimonials. You agree that you are responsible for comments you provide. We require that you do not provide any content that violates any law or that it may be considered to violate any law. As a recipient of the link of the Online Resume, you agree to abide by all the applicable law and by these Terms, and in particular obligations set out in sec. 7 of these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E. InterviewCheck</strong></p>
<p>Provider may offer "InterviewCheck", an additional service that may help you prepare for your recruitment process. InterviewCheck allows you to answer questions that may be used in a real-life job interview and receive feedback on your answers. The questions prepared beforehand by our experienced team members are examples and we cannot guarantee that they will appear in the real-life job recruitment process. You irrevocably waive any claim against us for your use of the Interview check.</p>
<p>The questions are open and we have no control over your answers. Provider makes no effort to review any input for any purpose, other than to provide you with feedback on your answers, including accuracy, legality or non-infringement. You agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality or non-infringement of your input. You warrant that you are the owner of the input and entitled to enter into these Terms and that the input does not infringe the proprietary or privacy rights of any third party. You confirm that no such input will be subject to any obligation, of confidence or otherwise, to you or any other person and that Provider shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such input. We require that you do not provide any content that violates any law or that it may be considered to violate any law.</p>
<p>Once you complete the simulation, we will display to you a final score and summary based solely on your answers (hereinafter collectively the &ldquo;summary&rdquo;). The summary will be a result of an automatic interpretation of your answers. Provider does not make any representations or warranties as to the summary you receive. Your summary is illustrative and we cannot guarantee that it will reflect the same results in the real-life recruitment process. Under no circumstances will Provider be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on the summary. The Provider makes no guarantee that the score or summary received will meet your requirements.</p>
<p>You can also access the summary through a link that we can send at your request to the mail address you provided. We strongly recommend that you are careful when entering the email address. If you enter the incorrect email address or purposely enter another person&rsquo;s email address, third parties may access your summary. Please note that once you provide an email address, we have no control over how you or a third party will use your summary. Due to privacy purposes, the link to the report will be active for a limited period. However, once a request to receive a link of your summary is fulfilled, it may have been accessed, stored, and/or copied by third parties and we are unable to delete the information from their systems.</p>
<p>By sharing the link to your summary, you do so at your own risk. You take full responsibility for using the received link for any other purpose than acknowledging your summary. Furthermore, you confirm that Provider has no obligation to pre-screen your summary. However, Provider reserves the right to pre-screen, refuse, alter, or remove any summary at its sole discretion. We may use the summary for any purpose we believe is necessary, especially to improve our service, for marketing services or testimonials.</p>
<p>Please note that in some cases you may use the Interview check as a Visitor. If that's the case, all provisions set out in these terms that apply to Registered User will apply to you accordingly, in particular Sec. 5-7 of these terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="payments"><strong>9. Payments and Subscriptions.</strong></p>
<p>If you purchase any services that Provider offers for a fee, either on a one-time or on a subscription basis, you agree that Provider&rsquo;s third-party vendors may store your payment information. You also allow Provider, through such third-party vendors, to use your payment method on file to process your subscription recurring charges and to process un-scheduled purchase transactions made by you through the Site. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the services you order (including, without limitation, periodic fees for monthly or annual subscriptions, or any additional administrative charge that may be applied) as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts.</p>
<p>Any recurring charge will be fixed at the price agreed to at the time of purchase. The specific billing terms for the services you order will be described on the offer page on the Site. When you sign up for automatic or recurring billing, you will be again notified of the billing terms and how to stop recurring billing on your transaction receipt. By signing up for Provider services with recurring billing, you will be deemed to agree to those billing terms as described specifically on the Site. In the event that your payment method does not successfully process you authorize us to complete a partial payment of the available balance on your card. The remaining balance will be charged on a separate transaction either to the same card or any other card on file. You also authorize us to charge you a non-refundable administration fee of up to $2.50USD or foreign equivalent, for each failed payment or any partial authorization, in order to keep your subscription temporarily active until the full subscription fee can be processed successfully and your subscription renewed.</p>
<p>For un-scheduled purchases, such as individual resume downloads, prints or emails, when such purchases are available, you agree that the Provider will charge your payment method on file for each of such un-scheduled purchases, individually, at the time of purchase. Such individual transactions are final and therefore, if you want a new modified version of your downloaded, printed or emailed resume, it will require a separate purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provider offers certain premium services such as Resume Review, Resume Writing, Premium Career Report and Cover Letter Writing , which may not be included in the cost of Provider&rsquo;s basic subscription services. Failure to pay for these premium services, if purchased, may result in the termination of your subscription. Also, trial offers may give you access to certain limited services and include one download, print or email only, with additional downloads, prints, or emails charged separately, during the trial period. Please read your trial offer carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used, and where your payment method was issued, your transaction may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, because of exchange rates. Your transaction may also be subject to foreign currency exchange fees assessed by your bank or card issuer. Provider is not responsible for any foreign currency exchange fees or surcharges and will not make any compensation or reimbursement for charges imposed by your bank or card issuer. Provider does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your Account or the applicable service, you authorize us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the subscription period until you cancel your subscription. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>Provider has the discretion to alter prices for services at any time, subject to the notification terms of Section 3 (Modifications).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="cancellations"><strong>10. Cancellations.</strong></p>

For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and the Provider will attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or the Provider to resolve the Dispute on terms that either you or the Provider, in each of our sole discretion, find unacceptable.&nbsp; Both you and the Provider agree that this Informal Dispute-Resolution Process is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before the initiation of arbitration against the other party.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(b) Arbitrating Disputes</strong>.&nbsp; After the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process, any remaining Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).&nbsp; If arbitration before JAMS is unavailable or impossible for any valid reason, any Dispute remaining after the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process will be conducted by, and according to, the rules and regulations then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).&nbsp; Either Party may initiate arbitration of a Dispute upon completion of the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process for that Dispute.&nbsp; The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any and all Disputes arising out of or relating to the formation, existence, scope, validity, interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, or any part of it, or of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any claim (except as explicitly outlined below) that all or any part of this agreement to arbitrate or the Terms of Use is void or voidable.&nbsp; If any party disagrees about whether any portion of this Section 24 can be enforced or whether it applies to the Dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that Dispute.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver contained in this arbitration agreement must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the class action waiver.&nbsp; Both you and the Provider understand and agree that we are waiving our right to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights, except as set forth below.</p>
<p>Unless you and the Provider agree otherwise, including to conduct the arbitration by telephone or videoconference or to have the arbitrator decide the Dispute without a hearing, any arbitration brought by or against a User who lives in the United States shall take place in-person in the User&rsquo;s hometown or in New York, NY, unless the arbitrator determines that a different location would better serve the convenience of the parties.&nbsp; If you live outside the United States, any arbitration will take place in New York, NY.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration will be handled by a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis &ndash; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Provider are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Exceptions</strong>.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement in this Section 24, you and the Provider agree that the following types of Disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction, unless both you and the Provider agree to submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to the procedures in this binding arbitration agreement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) Disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as the action or proceeding is brought and maintained as an individual action or proceeding and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(ii) Disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(iii) intellectual property Disputes.</p>
<p>Any litigation in court of the foregoing types of Disputes (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located within New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.&nbsp; Regardless of whether the foregoing types of Disputes in this Exceptions provision are resolved by a court or pursuant to arbitration, you and the Provider agree that the Dispute is subject to the class action waiver provision set in this Section 24.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Costs of Arbitration</strong>. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Provider will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each party is responsible for his, her, their or its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, and the Provider will not pay your attorneys&rsquo; fees or expenses except to the extent ordered by the arbitrator.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, in cases where a statute gives you the right to recover attorneys&rsquo; fees if you prevail, the arbitrator may award attorneys&rsquo; fees pursuant to that statute.&nbsp; In the event the arbitrator determines the Dispute you brought to arbitration is, in whole or in part, frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse the Provider for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by the Provider that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the JAMS Rules. In determining whether a Dispute is frivolous, in whole or in part, the arbitrator may consider whether the Provider has offered you a full refund of the sum you paid to the Provider for services provided by the Provider or has otherwise offered full relief to you in relation to your individual claim. If the arbitrator, upon final disposition of the case, finds your Dispute was not frivolous, the Provider will reimburse any filing fees that you paid and were not otherwise reimbursed.&nbsp; Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(e) Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BOLD LLC</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>City View Plaza II, Suite 6000</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Guaynabo, PR 00968</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>United States of America</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The notice must be sent to the Provider within thirty (30) days of your first agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp; If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver provision, the class action waiver still applies.&nbsp; You may not opt out of only the class action waiver provision and not also the arbitration provisions.&nbsp; If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, or if you opt out of both the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions, the Provider will also not be bound by them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(f) WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS</strong>.&nbsp; To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Provider each agree that any proceeding, whether in court or arbitration, to resolve any Dispute will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (&ldquo;CLASS ACTION&rdquo;).&nbsp; You and the Provider AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.&nbsp; You and the Provider EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM (whether arbitration, court, or otherwise).&nbsp; If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.&nbsp; Further, you and the Provider agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, the waiver of the right to bring claims in or otherwise participate in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding set forth in the class action waiver contained herein does not prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief in an individual capacity to the extent otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<p>IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES&rsquo; AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.&nbsp; If a court decides that the limitations of this Section 24(f) are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or consolidated or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>(g) Miscellaneous</strong>. We will provide notice of any material changes to this binding Arbitration Agreement and/or class action waiver (which may be satisfied by updating these Terms of Use, unless not otherwise permitted by law), in which case you will have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions and/or class action waiver within 30 days after such change, consistent with the terms above. Except as set forth above regarding the class action waiver provision, if any portion of these arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of these arbitration provisions. Other than with respect to the class action waiver, as set forth above, only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this binding Arbitration Agreement, including whether any Dispute falls within its scope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that the arbitration agreement and/or class action waiver in this Section 24 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for actions in small claims court) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located in New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.&nbsp; In the event any provision of these Terms of Use is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that, unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of these Terms of Use, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of these Terms of Use nor the remaining provisions herein (except as set forth above with respect to the class action waiver), and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.</p>
<p><strong>(h) <u>Non-Us Residents</u></strong>: If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Site or these Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of this Section 24(b) dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then, we have no obligation under this section. Your notice must be sent to us at <a href="mailto:legal@bold.com">legal@bold.com</a>. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Provider and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or Provider to resolve the Section 24(b) dispute on terms either you or Provider, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.</p>
<p><strong>(i) EU Residents</strong>: You may have a right to of out-of-court settlement of certain disputes in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 524/2013.
