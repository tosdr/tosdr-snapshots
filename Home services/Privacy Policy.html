<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information. You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make these privacy requests on your behalf to exercise these rights. An authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney in accordance with California law. If this has not occurred, we will require the agent to provide proof that you have authorized it to act on your behalf and may require you to verify your own identity with us directly before we accept a request. We will do this by requiring the authorized agent to present verifiable written authorization from you that you have provided the agent with permission to submit the request and independently verify the agent&#x27;s own identity with us.</p>
<p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: your email address, full name, postal address, date of birth, phone number, and any other reasonable information we require to process your request.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
<p>You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor&#x27;s identity or authority to make it.</p>
