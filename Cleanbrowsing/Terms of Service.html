		  <div>
			<p>
			  This Agreement governs CleanBrowsing’s cloud-based solutions (including this website) (“Cloud
			  Services”) and software made available in connection with the Cloud Services (“Software”). Section 2
			  (Cloud Services) applies specifically to the Cloud Services, and Section 3 (Software) applies
			  specifically to Software (including CleanBrowsing’s application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and
			  software development kits (“SDKs”)). Unless otherwise specified, all other Sections of this Agreement
			  apply to both the Cloud Services and the Software (collectively, the “Service”).

		  <span>2. Cloud Services</span>
		  <div>
			<ol>
			  <li>
				<strong>Access to Cloud Services</strong> Subject to your compliance with this Agreement (including,
				without limitation, all payment obligations), CleanBrowsing hereby grants to you a limited,
				revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable (except to Affiliates) right, to
				access and use the Cloud Services (“Cloud License”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf
				of an Entity, such Entity’s Affiliates may also access and use the Cloud Services provided that such
				Affiliates agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the Entity remain fully liable for
				such Affiliates’ actions and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if the Entity had
				performed such acts and omissions itself. “Affiliate” means any means an entity which, directly or
				indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control
				with a party, where “control” means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and
				“ownership” means the beneficial ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow
				majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity
				securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Restrictions</strong> Unless otherwise expressly permitted in writing by CleanBrowsing, you
				will not and you have no right to: <br />(a) rent, lease, loan, export or sell access to the Cloud
				Services to any third party; <br />(b) interfere with, disrupt, alter, or modify the Cloud Services
				or any part thereof, or create an undue burden on the Cloud Services or the networks or services
				connected to the Cloud Services; <br />(c) utilize any framing techniques to enclose any
				CleanBrowsing trademark, logo, service mark, or other trade dress (“CleanBrowsing Marks”) or
				Materials (defined below) or use any meta tags or other “hidden text” utilizing the CleanBrowsing
				Marks or Materials without CleanBrowsing’s written consent <br />(d) introduce software or automated
				agents or scripts into the Cloud Services so as to produce multiple accounts, generate automated
				searches, requests or queries, or to strip or mine data from the Cloud Services; <br />(f) perform
				or publish any benchmark tests or analyses relating to the Cloud Services without CleanBrowsing’s
				written consent; <br />(g) cover or obscure any page or part of the Cloud Services via HTML/CSS,
				scripting, or any other means; <br />(h) process or collect personal or business credit card
				information on any web property that is receiving Free Services (as defined below); or <br />(i) use
				the Cloud Services to store or transmit any “protected health information” as that term is defined
				in 45 C.F.R. 160.103 without CleanBrowsing’s written consent.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Credentials</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all
				usernames and passwords created by or assigned to you (“Credentials”), and are solely responsible
				for all activities that occur under such Credentials. You agree to notify CleanBrowsing promptly of
				any actual or suspected unauthorized use of any Credentials. CleanBrowsing reserves the right to
				terminate any Credentials that CleanBrowsing reasonably determines may have been accessed or used by
				an unauthorized third party, and will provide immediate notice of such to Customer. For your added
				security, we strongly encourage you to enable two-factor authentication in conjunction with all
				Credentials.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Subscription Terms, Renewals and Cancellations</strong> All Cloud Services that are provided
				to you as Paid Services (each a, “Paid Cloud Service”) will be provided to you on a subscription
				basis for the length of term that you specified during the initial sign-up process (“Subscription
				Term”). All of your subscriptions to Paid Cloud Services will automatically renew for periods equal
				to your initial Subscription Term, and you will be charged at our then-current rates unless you
				cancel your subscription through the Cloud Services’ account dashboard prior to your next scheduled
				billing date.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Your Information</strong>
				<ol>
				  <li>
					You and your End Users (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) will retain all right,
					title and interest in and to any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any
					type that you or your End Users transmit to or through the Cloud Services (collectively, “Your
					Information”) in the form provided to CleanBrowsing. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you
					hereby grant us a non-exclusive, fully sublicenseable, worldwide, royalty-free right to collect,
					use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of your Your Information, in each
					case to the extent necessary to provide the Cloud Services to you.
				  </li>
				  <li>
					You must obtain all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide Your Information to
					CleanBrowsing, and Your Information and its transfer must not violate any applicable local,
					state, federal and international laws and regulations (“Laws”) (including without limitation
					those relating to export control or electronic communications). Other than our security
					obligations under Section 6 (Security), we assume no responsibility or liability for Your
					Information, and you will be solely responsible for the consequences of using, disclosing,
					storing, transferring or transmitting Your Information.
				  </li>
				  <li>
					CleanBrowsing may modify certain components of Your Information on or transmitted to or from
					your website to enhance your website’s performance or security or the functionality of the Cloud
					Services. For example, depending on the CleanBrowsing Services you select or the Apps that you
					enable, CleanBrowsing may: (i) intercept requests determined to be threats and take actions,
					such as, presenting them with a challenge page, dropping the request, presenting alternative
					content, redirecting and other similar measures; (ii) add cookies to your domain to track
					visitors, such as those who have successfully passed the CAPTCHA on a challenge page; (iii) add
					scripts to your pages to perform additional performance tracking; (iv) add firewall rules to
					your website; and (v) make other changes to increase the performance, security or analytic
					capabilities of your website. CleanBrowsing will make it clear whenever a feature will
					materially modify Your Information and, whenever possible, provide you a mechanism to allow you
					to disable the feature.
				  </li>
				  <li>
					By transmitting Your Information to or through the Cloud Services, you represent and warrant
					that your Data, does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including
					any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity,
					or any other intellectual property or proprietary right.
				  </li>
				</ol>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Free & Trial Services</strong> We may offer free or trial versions of the Cloud Services
				(“Free Services”) from time to time. With respect to each such Free Service, we will make each such
				Free Service available to you free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial
				period (if applicable) for which you registered to use the Free Service; (b) the start date of your
				Subscription Term for the Paid Services version of such Free Service; or (c) termination of the Free
				Service by CleanBrowsing in our sole discretion. We will have no liability for any harm or damage
				arising out of or in connection with any Free Services.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Acceptable Use</strong> By using the Cloud Services you are agreeing, among other things,
				that you will not use the Cloud Services to (a) falsely imply any sponsorship or association with
				CleanBrowsing; (b) post, transmit, store or link to any files, materials, data, text, audio, video,
				images or other content that infringe on any person’s intellectual property rights or that are
				otherwise unlawful; or (c) engage in any activities that are illegal, including disseminating,
				promoting or facilitating child sexual abuse material or engaging in human trafficking.

			  <li>
				<strong>License Grant</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CleanBrowsing
				grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable (except to
				Affiliates) license to install and use the Software during your use of the applicable Cloud Services
				in accordance with this Agreement and any CleanBrowsing documentation (“License”). Your License will
				end upon the earlier of the termination of your use of the Cloud Services requiring such Software or
				the termination of this Agreement. Some Software may contain open source or third party software,
				which may have additional terms and restrictions regarding such software’s use.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Limitations</strong> You will not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise
				attempt to derive the source code, techniques, processes, algorithms, know-how or other information
				from the binary code portions of the Software (collectively, "Reverse Engineering") or permit or
				induce the foregoing. If however, directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing,
				you may engage in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is
				necessary to achieve interoperability of your own or third party software with the Software, and to
				the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is
				strictly necessary to obtain such information; and (b) you have first requested such information
				from us and we fail to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable
				terms and conditions.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Software Modifications</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for
				any elements of the Software provided to you in source code form you may modify such source code
				solely to the extent necessary to support your permitted use of the Software (collectively,
				“Modifications”). Unless expressly stated otherwise, you may not distribute your Modifications to
				any third party. CleanBrowsing has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or
				liability with respect to your Modifications or their combination, interaction or use with our Cloud
				Services. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims,
				costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs)
				arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating to your
				Modifications.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>CleanBrowsing Apps</strong> You may install or utilize certain third party apps (“Apps”) via
				the CleanBrowsing website at your election. CleanBrowsing does not make any representations,
				warranties or guarantees regarding the Apps. CleanBrowsing makes these Apps available to you on an
				“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. CleanBrowsing does not endorse the Apps. Each App is governed by
				the terms of service, end user license agreement and privacy policies provided by the third party
				that developed the App. CleanBrowsing will not be directly or indirectly responsible or liable to
				you in any manner, for any harms, damages, loss, lost profits, special or consequential damages or
				claims arising out of or in connection with, the installation of, use of, or reliance on the
				performance of any of the Apps. Further information related to the Apps is available on the
				CleanBrowsing Apps page located here.

		<div class="list-item">
		  <span>4. Billing</span>
		  <div>
			<ol>
			  <li>
				<strong>Recurring Billing</strong> In order to access those Services for which we require a fee
				(“Paid Services”) you will be required to provide CleanBrowsing with your credit card information
				(“Payment Method”). By providing a Payment Method you are authorizing us to charge your Payment
				Method on a monthly, annual basis, or pay-as-you-go basis, or as otherwise applicable for the fees
				associated with the Paid Services that you sign up for. Any Payment Method that you provide us must
				be valid, and kept current by you during the Subscription Term. By providing us with a Payment
				Method, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use such Payment Method. CleanBrowsing
				will begin billing your Payment Method for the Paid Services on the day that you sign up for such
				Paid Services, regardless of whether you have fully configured the Paid Services as of that date.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Price Changes</strong> We reserve the right to change the fees that we charge for the
				Service, at any time in our sole discretion, provided that we give you at least thirty (30) days’
				prior notice of such changes. Unless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the
				subscription fees will take effect in the billing period immediately following our notice to you.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>No Refunds</strong> FEES ARE NONREFUNDABLE. YOU WILL BE BILLED IN FULL FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION
				TERM IN WHICH YOU CANCEL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION
				TERM. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Paid Services
				through the end of your current Subscription Term. We may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund,
				discount, or credit (“Credits”) to you in a specific instance, however the provision of Credits in a
				specific instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances or obligate us
				to provide additional Credits.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Taxes</strong> Unless otherwise stated, our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties
				or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes
				assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are
				responsible for paying Taxes, except those assessable against CleanBrowsing as measured by our net
				income. Unless you provide us with evidence of an exemption, we will invoice you for such Taxes if
				we believe we have a legal obligation to do so and you agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.

		<div class="list-item">
		  <span>5. Beta Services</span>
		  <div>
			<p>
			  From time to time, we may make early stage or non-production Cloud Services and Software (“Beta
			  Services”) available to you at no charge. You may access these Beta Services in your sole discretion.
			  Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes only, and may be subject to additional terms that
			  will be presented to you at the time of sign-up. CleanBrowsing may, but is not obligated to, provide
			  you with support for the Beta Services or correct any bugs, defects, or errors in the Beta Services.
			  Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from
			  the trial start date or the date that a version of the Beta Services becomes generally available
			  without the applicable Beta Services designation. We may discontinue Beta Services at any time in our
			  sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Notwithstanding Section 12, we will have
			  no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Beta Services.

		</div>
		<div class="list-item">
		  <span>6. Security</span>
		  <div>
			<p>
			  We implement security procedures to help protect your Data from security threats. However, you
			  understand that your use of the Service necessarily involves transmission of Your Information over
			  networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your
			  Information that is lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. We cannot guarantee
			  that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Information will always be
			  secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those
			  of our third party service providers.
			</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<div class="list-item">
		  <span>7. Trade Sanctions and Export Control</span>
		  <div>
			<p>
			  You may not use the Service for any reason if you or any party that owns or controls you, are subject
			  to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but
			  not limited to the lists maintained by the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals
			  List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury, and the Entity List of the
			  U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government
			  authority. You may not use the Service to export or re-export any information or technology to any
			  country, individual, or entity to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited.
			</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<div class="list-item">
		  <span>8. Termination of Use; Discontinuation and Modification of the Service</span>
		  <div>
			<p>
			  You will lose your license to use the Service if you violate any provision of this Agreement.
			  CleanBrowsing’s policy is to investigate violations of this Agreement. Additionally, we may at our
			  sole discretion terminate your user account or suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any
			  time, with or without notice for any reason or no reason at all. We also reserve the right to modify
			  or discontinue the Service at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing
			  certain features of the Service) without notice to you. We will have no liability whatsoever on
			  account of any change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the
			  Service. You may terminate your account at any time through the Service’s account dashboard.

			<ol>
			  <li>
				<strong>By CleanBrowsing</strong> CleanBrowsing will defend you against any third party claim
				brought against you, to the extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a Paid Service,
				when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or
				registered copyright (a "Claim"), and we will indemnify you against any damages and costs (including
				reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction attributable to such a
				Claim or agreed to settlement by CleanBrowsing. If any portion of a Paid Service becomes, or in
				CleanBrowsing’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, CleanBrowsing
				may, at CleanBrowsing’s option: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the Paid Service;
				(b) replace the Paid Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the
				functionality of the Paid Service; (c) modify the Paid Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or
				(d) terminate the Paid Service and refund any pre-paid subscription fees covering the remainder of
				the Subscription Term, and upon such termination, you will immediately cease all use of the Paid
				Service. CleanBrowsing will have no obligation under this Section 10 or otherwise with respect to
				any infringement claim based upon: (w) any use of a Paid Service not in accordance with this
				Agreement or the Documentation; any use of a Paid Service in combination with third party products
				or services not supplied by CleanBrowsing; or (z) any modification of a Paid Service by any person
				other than CleanBrowsing or its authorized agents. THIS SUBSECTION SETS FORTH CleanBrowsing’S SOLE
				AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF
				INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>By You</strong> You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you
				agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CleanBrowsing and its officers, directors, employees,
				consultants, Affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the "CleanBrowsing Entities") from
				and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable
				attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to, use of, or
				alleged use of the Service; (ii) your violation of this Agreement or any representation, warranty,
				or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any
				third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity,
				confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third
				party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any

		  <span>17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</span>
		  <div>
			<ol>
			  <li>
				<strong>Generally</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and CleanBrowsing in
				the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and CleanBrowsing agree that any and all disputes
				arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is
				more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
				jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review
				by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement
				to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any
				aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any
				other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of
				this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CleanBrowsing
				ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Exceptions</strong> Notwithstanding Subsection 17.1, we both agree that nothing herein will
				be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual
				action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or
				local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or
				(iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Arbitrator</strong> Any arbitration between you and CleanBrowsing will be governed by the
				Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration
				Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA
				Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Notice; Process</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
				notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in
				the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
				CleanBrowsing's address for Notice is: CleanBrowsing, Inc., 220 Adams Drive, Suite 280 #304,
				Weatherford, Texas 76086. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;
				and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to
				resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the
				Notice is received, you or CleanBrowsing may commence an arbitration proceeding.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Fees</strong> Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in
				Weatherford, Texas provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
				arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii)
				through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established
				by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that
				either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
				improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
				then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse
				CleanBrowsing for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay
				under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
				will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions
				on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
				disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
				and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>No Class Actions</strong> YOU AND CleanBrowsing AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
				OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
				PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CleanBrowsing agree
				otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
				preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Modifications</strong> In the event that CleanBrowsing makes any future change to this
				arbitration provision (other than a change to CleanBrowsing's address for Notice), you may reject
				any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to CleanBrowsing's address
				for Notice, in which case your account with CleanBrowsing will be immediately terminated and this
				arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Enforceability</strong> If Subsection 17.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety
				of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null
				and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in
				Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
