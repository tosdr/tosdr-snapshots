			  If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the United Kingdom or

		  <span>5. Information Sharing</span>

			<p>
			  We work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service Providers”). These companies would
			  provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact
			  our existing Customers as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and

			  instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy and other applicable confidentiality and
			  security measures and regulations, including our obligations under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy
			  Shield frameworks described in Section 7, below.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with
			  them or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any
			  purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us.
			</p>
			<p>
			  In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we also may share your information
			  with others in the following circumstances:
			</p>
			<ol>
			  <li>
				With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us distribute the Services to Customers;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business;

			  <li>
				When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or
				legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. (Learn
				more about how we handle law enforcement requests here);
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action
				regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
				physical safety of any person, or violations of our Website Terms of Use, Self-Serve Subscription
				Agreement, and/or Enterprise Subscription Terms of Service; or as otherwise required to comply with

			  CleanBrowsing is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your information in the United
			  States and the European Economic Area. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access
			  such information from around the world, including from other countries in which CleanBrowsing has
			  operations for the purposes described in this Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
			  If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, you

			<ol>
			  <li>
				Attendees, Website Visitors, Customers, and Registrants: You have the right to access, correct,
				update, export, or delete your personal information. You may email us at support@cleanbrowsing.org
				with any such subject access requests (“SAR”), and we will respond within thirty (30) days.
				Customers also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their
				profile or organization record at cleanbrowsing.org.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Public Resolver Users: We do not retain any personally identifiable information about Public
				Resolver Users that would be subject to the data subject rights described above.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				End Users: CleanBrowsing has no direct relationship with End Users. Accordingly, we rely upon our
				Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for subject access requests. If an End
				User requests that we access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer wishes to
				be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, we will direct that End User to contact
				the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are solely responsible
				for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website
				users.
			  </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			  For any SAR, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can
			  assist. Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request
			  against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with SARs to the extent
			  required by applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield. In the EEA, the United Kingdom and
			  Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
