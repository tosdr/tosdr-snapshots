                <p>We may share your personal data with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
                <p>We may disclose your personal data to third parties:</p>
                <p>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may if relevant disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or</p>
                <p>if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                <p>When we process your personal data for the above purposes, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in pursuing business aims and objectives.</p>
                </li><li><strong>Data transfers</strong>
                <p>Where a legal basis of processing applies, we may share your personal information with a third-party processor, FreshDesk, that we engage with to provide you with products and services you required. This third party may need to process your personal information on our behalf to provide such services.</p>
                </li><li><strong>Data Security</strong>
                <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
                <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
                </li><li><strong>Your rights</strong>
                <p>Your personal data is protected by legal rights, which include your rights:</p>
                <p><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                <p><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you</strong>. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                <p><strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> <strong>of your personal data</strong> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                <p><strong>Request restriction of processing of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
                <p><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party</strong>. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> <strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data</strong>. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details above, but please note that you should contact the Organisation with regard to the processing of your personal data where the Organisation is the data controller.</p>
                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at using the details above. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
                <p>You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office, which regulates the processing of personal data, about how we are processing your personal data.</p>
