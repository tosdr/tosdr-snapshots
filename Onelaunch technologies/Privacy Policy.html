<p>
OneLaunch is committed to protecting the security of any Personal Data that is collected by us. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect any Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Despite these measures, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. OneLaunch cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the collection and storage of any Personal Data, including without limitation, any mistakes and security breaches that may happen. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the unlikely event of a data breach where your Personal Data has been compromised, OneLaunch will promptly notify you, the applicable authorities and supervisory authorities or data protection authorities.
</p>
<p>
If you are located in the EU/EEA where European Data Law applies and OneLaunch is required to transfer your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we exert commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any transfer of your Personal Data outside of the EU/EEA is protected under industry standard contractual clauses, and any subsequent data protection safeguards. Where European Data Law applies, OneLaunch shall not process its collected Personal Data (nor permit its collected Personal Data to be processed) in a territory outside of the EU/EEA unless it has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with European Data Law. Such measures may include (without limitation) transferring its collected Personal Data to a recipient in a country that the European Commission has decided provides adequate protection for Personal Data, to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with European Data Law, or to a recipient that has executed standard contractual clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.
