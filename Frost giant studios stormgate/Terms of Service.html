Department of Legal &amp; Business Affairs.</p><p><b>O. FOR RESIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA -- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p><p>The informal resolution and binding individual arbitration requirements in this Section O apply to all Disputes between you and Frost Giant.  &quot;Dispute&quot; means any dispute, claim or controversy (excluding only those exceptions listed below) between you and Frost Giant, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, for which either party seeks legal recourse.  This includes, without limitation, any Dispute pertaining to your use or attempted use of the Product or to anything in this Agreement.  **Disputes that must be arbitrated also include disputes over the validity, enforceability, or scope of this agreement to arbitrate or any portion of it.  **In the United States, this agreement to arbitrate is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;).  In all jurisdictions where it applies, it will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.  An arbitration proceeding has different rules than a lawsuit in a court. For example, arbitration is less formal and usually provides for more limited information sharing between the parties in the process called discovery. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final and you or Frost Giant will generally not be able to change the outcome by appealing it to a court.</p><p>The exceptions to this arbitration are: (i) claims that can be brought as individual actions in small-claims court in the jurisdiction where you reside; (ii) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (iii) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (iv) your or Frost Giant&#39;s right to seek injunctive relief in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (v) claims of intellectual-property infringement (including claims of piracy; or creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats) or tortious interference; and (vi) the enforceability of the requirement that arbitrations must be conducted on an individual rather than a class basis.</p><p>This Section O only applies to Disputes and does not prevent either party from taking unilateral actions they are entitled to take under this Agreement. This means, for example, that you can terminate your access to the Product at any time without following this dispute resolution process. Likewise, Frost Giant may enforce this Agreement through actions like suspending and terminating your Account&#39;s access to the Product at any time, in its sole discretion, without following this dispute resolution process. This freedom to unilaterally act in accordance with the Agreement is important so that Frost Giant can ensure a positive and fair experience for users of the Product by taking immediate action against players engaged in cheating, pirating (selling or trading accounts), or violating others&#39; rights in their intellectual property.  If you believe that Frost Giant has made a mistake, that disagreement is a Dispute that must be resolved using the process set forth in this Section O.</p><ol><li><b>Informal Resolution</b> If you have a Dispute against Frost Giant or if Frost Giant has a Dispute against you, you and Frost Giant will attempt to resolve the Dispute informally before an arbitration is filed in order to resolve the Dispute faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and Frost Giant will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Dispute for at least 30 days (&quot;<b>Informal Resolution</b>&quot;) from the day you receive or Frost Giant receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a &quot;<b>Notice of Dispute</b>&quot;) in accordance with this Agreement. You will send any Notice of Dispute to <b>legal@frostgiant.com</b>. Frost Giant will send any Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and to any billing address you have provided us. The Notice of Dispute sent by either party must include the sender&#39;s name, address, and other contact information, a description of the Dispute (including any relevant account names or Steam identifiers), and what resolution to the Dispute is being sought. The Informal Resolution requirement is designed to allow Frost Giant (or you, in the case of a Dispute that Frost Giant asserts against you) to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or Frost Giant cannot proceed to arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution period. If you or Frost Giant proceed to arbitration without providing a compliant Notice of Dispute and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution period, a court may enjoin the filing and order the party that has not followed the Informal Resolution process to reimburse the other party for any arbitration fees and costs already incurred. The compliance of a Notice of Dispute with this Agreement, including whether a Notice of Dispute contained all required information, is an issue to be decided by a court.</li><li><b>Binding Individual Arbitration</b> You and Frost Giant agree that Disputes will be settled by <b>binding individual arbitration</b> conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (&quot;<b>NAM</b>&quot;), <a href="https://namadr.com/">https://namadr.com</a>, according to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;<b>FAA</b>&quot;) and federal arbitration law and according to NAM&#39;s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Dispute arises (the &quot;Rules&quot;), as modified by this Agreement. &quot;<b>Arbitration</b>&quot; means that Disputes you have with Frost Giant and Disputes that Frost Giant has with you will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. &quot;<b>Individual</b>&quot; means that the arbitrator may award the same remedies to you or Frost Giant as a court could, but only to satisfy your or Frost Giant&#39;s individual claims. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may not award money or other relief for the benefit of any person other than you or Frost Giant as part of the resolution of any Dispute. &quot;<b>Binding</b>&quot; means that both you and Frost Giant will have to live with the arbitrator&#39;s decision, except to the limited extent appeals to a court are permitted under the FAA. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement, and the Rules applicable to the arbitration, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but (as provided above) only to the extent necessary to provide relief to a party in arbitration warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.</li><li><b>Arbitration Procedure and Location/Venue for Non-Arbitrated Disputes</b> You or Frost Giant may initiate arbitration of any Disputes not resolved by Informal Resolution by filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM in accordance with the Rules.  (Instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling NAM at 800-358-2550, and instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879.) You will send a copy of any Demand for Arbitration to **legal@frostgiant.com. **Frost Giant will send any Demand for Arbitration to the email address and to any billing address you have provided us. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. You and Frost Giant both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement. For Disputes in which the claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely on the basis of written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For matters in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in Irvine, California, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for the claimant, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant&#39;s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules.The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Frost Giant mutually agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator&#39;s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or Frost Giant to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).An arbitration award, and any judgment confirming it, apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself.Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.Any Disputes between us that are not subject to arbitration, other than disputes filed in small claims court, may be filed only in the state courts in Orange County, California, or if federal jurisdiction exists, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and you consent as part of this Agreement to personal jurisdiction in such courts and to venue such cases exclusively in these courts. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting either you or Frost Giant from removing a case from state to federal court if removal is allowed under applicable law.</li><li><b>Consumer Arbitration Fees</b> The terms of this Consumer Arbitration Fees section only apply to you if you are a Consumer. If you start an arbitration against Frost Giant, you will pay the filing fee required for consumer arbitrations. In some situations, Frost Giant will help you with the fees related to an arbitration you start against Frost Giant.  If the Dispute involves a claim of damages of USD $10,000 or less, including any attorneys&#39; fees and all other relief you are seeking, Frost Giant will pay all of the arbitration costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.  Even if the Dispute involves a claim of damages of more than USD $10,000, Frost Giant may (but is not obligated to) help you with your fees, if you demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs.  For purposes of calculating damages under this paragraph, similar claims brought by multiple claimants represented by the same or coordinated counsel will be aggregated. If Frost Giant starts an arbitration against you, Frost Giant will pay all filing fees and costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay. Arbitration costs do not include your attorneys&#39; fees and expenses if you choose to be represented by an attorney. If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys&#39; fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.</li><li><b>Notice and Filing</b> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you or Frost Giant must start arbitration of a Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you or Frost Giant to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, that shorter deadline applies instead. The failure to begin arbitration regarding a Dispute within the time frames described above in this section shall bar the Dispute, which means that you and Frost Giant will not have the right to assert the Dispute.</li><li><b>Coordinated Filings</b> If 25 or more Notices of Disputes are sent that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered &quot;<b>Coordinated Cases</b>&quot; and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Cases are filed in arbitration as set forth in this Agreement. Frost Giant or you may advise the other of its or your belief that cases are Coordinated Cases, and disputes over whether a case or cases meet the contractual definition of &quot;Coordinated Cases&quot; will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. **Demands for Arbitration in Coordinated Cases shall only be filed with the arbitration provider as permitted by the bellwether process set forth below. **Frost Giant will pay only its share of arbitration fees for Coordinated Cases; the claimants will be responsible for their share of those fees.  **Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for claims asserted in a Coordinated Case from the time a compliant Notice of Dispute has been received by a party until, under the terms of this Agreement, the Coordinated Case may be filed in arbitration or court.**Once counsel in the Coordinated Cases has advised Frost Giant that all or substantially all of the Notices of Dispute have been provided, counsel for the parties shall confer in good faith regarding the number of cases that should proceed in arbitration as bellwethers, to allow each side to test the merits of its arguments. If counsel for the parties do not agree on the number of bellwethers, an even number shall be chosen by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter (or, in the arbitration provider&#39;s discretion, by a process arbitrator). Factors that the arbitration provider may consider in making this decision include the complexity of the dispute and differences in facts or applicable laws among various cases. Once the number of bellwethers is fixed, by agreement or by the arbitration provider, each side shall select half that number from among the claimants who have provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and <b>only</b> those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Cases will be delayed by this bellwether process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Case chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.Once all bellwether trials have concluded (or sooner if the counsel for the claimants and Frost Giant agree), the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Cases, with each side paying half the applicable mediation fee. Frost Giant and counsel for the claimants must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether trial. If counsel for Frost Giant and claimants cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. Frost Giant and counsel for the claimants will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.If the mediation does not yield a global resolution, this arbitration requirement shall no longer apply to Disputes that are the subject of Coordinated Cases for which a compliant Notice of Dispute was received by the other party but that were not resolved in bellwether proceedings. Such Disputes may be filed only in the state courts in Orange County, California, or if federal jurisdiction exists, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and you consent as part of this Agreement to venue such cases exclusively in these courts. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting either you or Frost Giant from removing a case from state to federal court if removal is allowed under applicable law. To the extent you are asserting the same claims as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. If a formerly arbitrable Dispute is brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in the Coordinated Cases who provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis. A court shall have authority to enforce this bellwether process and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.</li><li><b>Continuation in Effect</b> The dispute resolution process set forth in this Section O survives any termination of this Agreement.</li><li><b>Severability</b> If all or any provision of this Section O is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then you and Frost Giant agree that the provision will be severed, and the rest of this Agreement, including Section O shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the prohibition on class arbitrations is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and Frost Giant agree that this entire Section O will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of law clauses specified in this Agreement.</li><li><b>Your 30-Day Right to Opt Out</b> You have the right to opt out of and not to be bound by the Binding Individual Arbitration provisions set forth in this Section O. To exercise this right, you must send written notice of your decision to the following address: Frost Giant Studios, Inc.  150 Progress, Suite #150, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn.

TO BE EFFECTIVE, THIS NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED OR DEPOSITED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW; OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE BOUND TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION O. You are responsible for ensuring that Frost Giant receives your opt-out notice, so you may wish to send it by a means that provides for a delivery receipt. If you opt out of these provisions, Frost Giant also will not be bound by them with respect to Disputes with you.</li></ol><p><b>P. CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b><br/>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, for any case not subject to the requirement to arbitrate (except to the limited extent discussed above for Coordinated Cases), you and Frost Giant will only bring disputes, claims, or controversies between you and Frost Giant in an individual capacity and shall not:</p><ol><li>seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (like private attorney general actions); or</li><li>consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms.</li></ol><p><b>Q.
