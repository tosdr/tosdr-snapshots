            by third-party ads networks. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing excludes information that originates
            from Google Fit. You may opt out of personalized advertising from Pacer from the Mobile App privacy
            settings. You may also opt out of personalized advertising entirely within the operating system settings of
            your mobile device.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pacer Premium members are not shown advertisements and therefore are opt-ed out of
