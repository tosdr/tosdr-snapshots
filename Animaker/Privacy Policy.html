If your Company authorizes you to join an Animaker-powered, customer- created Instance feature/function and create a user account, you are an “Authorized User,” as further described in the User Terms of Service at https//www.animaker.com/terms-policy. For sake of clarification, “you” or “your” generally refers to the Authorized User. If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer sets its own policies regarding storage, processing, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data, which may affect your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place. In some cases, as fully discussed in our User Terms of Service at https//www.animaker.com/terms-policy, you may be both the Authorized User and the Customer.</li>
          <li><h3>2. Other information</h3> Animaker may also collect and receive the following information:</li>

          <li>g. Device Information. We may collect information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and crash data.

          <li>i) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</li>
          <li>ii) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</li>
          <li>iii) that it has implemented the technical and organizational security measures before processing the personal data transferred;</li>
          <li>iv) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:</li>
          <li>v) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,</li>
          <li>vi) any accidental or unauthorized access, and</li>
          <li>vii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorized to do so;</li>
          <li>viii) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;</li>
          <li>ix) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;</li>
          <li>x) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for sub-processing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;</li>
          <li>xi) that, in the event of sub-processing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;</li>
          <li><h3>2) Obligations of the data exporter</h3></li>
          <li>The data exporter agrees and warrants:</li>
          <li>i) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;</li>
          <li>ii) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;</li>
          <li>iii) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures;</li>
          <li>iv) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;</li>
          <li>v) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;</li>
          <li>vi) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;</li>
          <li>vii) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for sub-processing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information; and</li>
          <li>viii) that, in the event of sub-processing, the processing activity is carried out in at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of the data subject as the data importer under the Clauses.</li>
          <li><h3>3) Liability</h3></li>
          <li>i) The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred above by any party or sub-processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.</li>
          <li>ii) If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph a against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to above, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.</li>
