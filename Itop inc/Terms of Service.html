        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>

In the event that iTop is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It includes an arbitration provision.<br>
          For this section, the words "you" and "iTop" include any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. The word "claim" means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to the Product, this Agreement, and this Claims Resolution provision, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision.

You or iTop may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and iTop agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Notice to iTop must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. The notice must be sent to feedback@itopvpn.com. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Mediation</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Either you or iTop may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or iTop’s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If you live in the United States, you or iTop may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. If you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you. In individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Initiating Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning arbitration, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. If iTop choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of iTop’s selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and iTop agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the "FAA").
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You or iTop may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or iTop may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          iTop will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Limitations on Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and iTop alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and iTop agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Procedures</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Fees and Costs</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

You or iTop may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and iTop agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Notice to iTop must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. The notice must be sent to feedback@itopvpn.com. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Mediation</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Either you or iTop may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or iTop’s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If you live in the United States, you or iTop may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. If you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you. In individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.

        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Initiating Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning arbitration, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. If iTop choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of iTop’s selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and iTop agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the "FAA").
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You or iTop may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or iTop may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          iTop will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Limitations on Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and iTop alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and iTop agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Procedures</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>

          You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Section 13. Claims Resolution</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Most customer concerns can be resolved through iTop’s online support center (available at https://www.itopvpn.com/support) or by calling our customer service department at the toll-free number iTop has provided you. In the event that iTop is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It includes an arbitration provision. <br>For this section, the words "you" and "iTop" include any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. The word "claim" means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to the Product, this Agreement, and this Claims Resolution provision, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. The word "claim" also includes but is not limited to: (i) initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims; (ii) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (iii) claims by or against any third-party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with Agreement; and (iv) claims that arise from or relate to advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the Product. You or iTop may not sell, assign or transfer a claim. </p>

      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and iTop agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Notice to iTop must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. The notice must be sent to feedback@itopvpn.com. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Mediation</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Either you or iTop may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or iTop’s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If you live in the United States, you or iTop may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. If you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you. In individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Initiating Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning arbitration, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. If iTop choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of iTop’s selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and iTop agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the "FAA").</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">You or iTop may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or iTop may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">iTop will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Limitations on Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and iTop alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and iTop agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Procedures</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Fees and Costs</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Awards</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer iTop made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include: (i) any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $2,000; and (ii) any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Your Right To Reject Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">You may reject this Arbitration provision by sending a rejection notice to iTop at: <a href="mailto:feedback@itopvpn.com">feedback@itopvpn.com</a>. Your rejection notice must be sent within 30 days after your first download or purchase of the Product. Your rejection notice must state that you reject the Arbitration provision and must include your name, address, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the name of the Product, the email address you previously provided to iTop, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. If your rejection notice complies with these requirements, this Arbitration provision will not apply to you, except for any claims subject to pending litigation or arbitration at the time you send your rejection notice.

Rejecting this Arbitration provision will not affect your ability to use the Product.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Continuation</p>

          For this section, the words "you" and "iTop" include any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. The word "claim" means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to the Product, this Agreement, and this Claims Resolution provision, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. The word "claim" also includes but is not limited to: (i) initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims; (ii) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (iii) claims by or against any third-party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with Agreement; and (iv) claims that arise from or relate to advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the Product. You or iTop may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and iTop agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Notice to iTop must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. The notice must be sent to feedback@itopvpn.com. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Mediation</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Either you or iTop may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or iTop’s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If you live in the United States, you or iTop may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. If you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you. In individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.

        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Initiating Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning arbitration, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. If iTop choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of iTop’s selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and iTop agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the "FAA").
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You or iTop may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or iTop may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          iTop will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Limitations on Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and iTop alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and iTop agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Procedures</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>

          You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

It includes an arbitration provision.<br>
          For this section, the words "you" and "iTop" include any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. The word "claim" means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to the Product, this Agreement, and this Claims Resolution provision, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. The word "claim" also includes but is not limited to: (i) initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims; (ii) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (iii) claims by or against any third-party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with Agreement; and (iv) claims that arise from or relate to advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the Product. You or iTop may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</p>

        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Sending a Claim Notice</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and iTop agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Notice to iTop must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. The notice must be sent to feedback@itopvpn.com. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Mediation</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">Either you or iTop may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or iTop’s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If you live in the United States, you or iTop may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. If you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you. In individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Initiating Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          Before beginning arbitration, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision. If iTop choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of iTop’s selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and iTop agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (the "FAA").
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You or iTop may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered. Either you or iTop may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          iTop will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Limitations on Arbitration</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and iTop alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and iTop agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Procedures</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.
        </p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Fees and Costs</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
          You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Awards</p>
        <p class="fb4">
          If the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer iTop made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include: (i) any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $2,000; and (ii) any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

Your rejection notice must be sent within 30 days after your first download or purchase of the Product. Your rejection notice must state that you reject the Arbitration provision and must include your name, address, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the name of the Product, the email address you previously provided to iTop, if any, and the license code iTop provided to you, if any. If your rejection notice complies with these requirements, this Arbitration provision will not apply to you, except for any claims subject to pending litigation or arbitration at the time you send your rejection notice.

        Before beginning mediation, you or iTop must first send a claim notice. If you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or iTop may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation. If you live outside of the United States, you may contact iTop for information on potential mediators. iTop will pay the fees of the mediator.

        If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor iTop will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, neither you nor iTop will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or iTop would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.

At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
        You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction. iTop will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, iTop will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.

        <p class="title fh4 color-pro">Arbitration Awards</p>
        <p class="fb4 paragraph">
        If the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer iTop made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include: (i) any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $2,000; and (ii) any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.
