  We run a self-hosted installation of Plausible Analytics to collect some
  anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall
  trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All
  the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected.

  There are some occasions, where we need to add a simple "source" query parameter
  to URLs so that we can see where visitors are coming from, as referrers only
  work within browsers and with platforms that don't use special redirect mechanisms.

  In order to maximize privacy in these cases, we remove the query parameter on page visit.
  To keep transparency, we don't just delete the query parameter, but move them into the URL
  hash "#disabled", to keep them visible, but disabled.

  Here are some keywords, so that everyone who is curious will find this code snippet faster:
  plausible, analysis, analytics, campaign, tracking, query, hash, URL, #disabled?source=
