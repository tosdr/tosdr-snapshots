  Purposes and legal bases of data processing
</h2>

<p>
  Experteer is your personal career service agency, which gives you access and transparency to the high-quality employment market. Our service will help you identify your position and opportunities in the employment market, and will help you take control of your career. You therefore confide in us with your career-related personal data, which we carefully store for these purposes, according to your preferences, and provided it to you as needed. Experteer provides you, with “Privacy by Design” in the view settings of your employment record, the ability to determine easily and in a distinguishable manner which data you wish to make visible to recruiters checked by us, and, in particular, provides the option to you to adjust this in varied ways for headhunters or for internal company recruiters.
</p>
<p>
  You may create your employment record with your individual milestones, career goals and various attachments. This profile serves, on the one hand, to better match open positions and allows you, on the other hand, to make this profile available to headhunters and company recruiters in a simple, discreet and secure manner. You will be informed about relevant open positions via saved searches or the Experteer Career Newsletter.
</p>
<p>
  Experteer is not an ad-supported business model and does not rely on marketing the “user as a product”. Our product comprises an online career service agency that we offer for professionals and executives. The candidate as the customer is the centre of our business model. Under this, you give us your trust and thereby give us considerable amounts of personal data about your career path and your goals. We commit ourselves to dealing with your data in full confidence and in your interest, and to support your career as best possible. Our business model is built precisely upon this, unlike free portals.
</p>
<p>
  If you feel that we are not in keeping with the terms of this statement or the data protection provisions, please contact us at the following email address: privacy.us@experteer.com.
</p>
<p>
  For the processing of your personal data, the provisions of the EU GDPR and all other applicable data protection regulations are complied with. Legal bases for the data processing arise are provided for specifically in Art. 6 EU GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  We use your data for business contact, to fulfil contractual and legal obligations, to perform on the contractual relationship, to offer products and services, and to strengthen the customer relationship, which may include marketing and direct advertising.
</p>
<p>
  Data entered related to your employment record and your career goals are provided directly to headhunters, recruiters, and/or indirectly via recruitment software providers and applicant database providers. These data entries are the core purpose and value added of the Experteer service provision and will always be shared according to your personal preferences. These data are specifically entered by you in your employment record, your career goal and applications, as well as any attachments as well as your user account.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the data you provide will be used for the contractual relationship with Experteer.
</p>
<p>

You may also adjust the frequency of communication via email in your account settings.
</p>
<p>
  Your consent also comprises the data protection permission requirement. In this, we will inform you about the purposes of data processing and your right of withdrawal. Should the consent also refer to the processing of special categories of personal data, we will point this out to you in the consent.
</p>
<p>
  A processing of special categories of personal data, for the purpose of Art. 9 para. 1 EU GDPR, only takes place when this is required on the basis of legal provisions, and there is no reason to believe that your legitimate interest prevails to the exclusion of this processing.

  Contact form / contact by email (Article 6 para. 1, lit. a, b EU GDPR)
</h2>

<p>
  On our website a contact form is available, which may be used for electronic contact. If you write to us via the contact form, we will process your data provided in the contact form in order to contact you and answer your questions and requests.
</p>
<p>
  In doing so, we respect the principle of data economy and data avoidance, by providing only the information we need to contact you. These comprise your email address as well as the message field itself. In addition, your IP address is processed due to technical necessity as well as legal security.
</p>

  Registration / Customer account (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b EU GDPR)
</h2>

<p>
  On our website, we offer users the opportunity to register by providing personal information. The advantage is that you may, in particular, store your profile data permanently, so that you may be found and contacted by headhunters and recruiters. In addition, when applying for job postings, you may easily share your profile information, significantly accelerating the application process.
</p>
<p>
  The registration is therefore either necessary or option in order to fulfil a contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures.
</p>
<p>
  In order to fulfil the services we offer, such as our CV check, which is intended to help you increase your chances of a successful job interview, we are supported by various service providers. A corresponding contract is set up with each of these service providers so that the protection of your personal data is guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
  The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, as only the data necessary for registration must be entered. These are, for example, the e-mail address and password including password repetition.
</p>
<p>
  For the subscription to a premium membership, information on the billing address (title, first name, last name, address) must also be provided.
</p>
<p>
  By registering on our website, the IP address of the user, the date and time of registration are also stored (technical background data). By clicking the “Register now” button, you give the consent to the processing of your data.
</p>
<p>
  Please note: Your password will be stored in encrypted form by us. Employees of our company are not able to read this password. Therefore, they can give you no information, if you have forgotten your password.
</p>
<p>
  In this event, use the “Forgot password” function, which will send you a link to re-enter your password via email. No employee is entitled to request your password by telephone or in writing. Please never give your password if you receive such requests.
</p>
<p>
  Upon completion of the registration process, your data will be stored with us for the use of the protected customer area. Once you access our website with your email address with your username and password, this data will be made available for the actions you have carried out on our website (for example, for the subscription to a premium membership on our website). Completed orders may be tracked in the “My Account” area. Changes to the billing address may be entered here.
</p>
<p>
  Registered persons are free to make any changes/corrections to the billing information in the “My Account” area. Changes/corrections will also be gladly carried out by our customer service, if you contact them. Naturally, you may also cancel or delete the registration and/or your customer account. You will find the description for that in the “My Account” area.
</p>

<h2 class="is-delta">
  Experteer Premium membership (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b EU GDPR)

<p>
  We process the data provided by you as part of a subscription to an Experteer Premium Membership, only for the implementation and/or fulfilment of the contractual relationship, unless you agree to a further use.
</p>

  We respect the principle of data economy and data avoidance, by providing only with the information we need to implement the contract and/or to fulfil our contractual obligations (i.e. your name, address, email address, and payment data needed for each payment method) or to collect it we are required by law.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, your IP address is processed due to technical necessity as well as legal security. Without this data, we would have to unfortunately reject the execution of the contract, because we would then not be able to implement it or would have to, if necessary, terminate an existing contract. Naturally, you may also provide more data if you wish.
</p>

<h2 class="is-delta">
  Payment systems (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b EU GDPR)
</h2>

<p>
  On our website, you may pay by credit card, PayPal or direct debit (SEPA direct debit). For this, the relevant payment-related data is collected in order to execute your order and payment. In addition, your IP address is processed due to technical necessity as well as legal security.
</p>
<p>
  We respect the principle of data economy and data avoidance, by providing us with only the data we need to perform the payment and fulfilment of the contract or to collect it we are required by law.
</p>
<p>
  Without this data, we would have to unfortunately reject the execution of the contract, because we would then not be able to implement it.
</p>
<p>
  Payments are processed by our partner Adyen BV, Simon Carmiggelstraat 6 - 50, 1011 DJ Amsterdam. To prevent and detect fraud, we send your IP address to Adyen BV. Your IP address will be stored by Adyen BV. All data is transmitted in encrypted form.
</p>
<p>
  We would like to point out that Adyen B.V. transmits your personal data to other entities necessary for the fulfilment of the transaction, in particular, to the participating credit institutions, banks, credit card institutions. The processing of your personal data to process the payment also takes place.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note on credit card payment</strong>: As is usual with credit card payments, credit card details are checked.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note on PayPal</strong>: PayPal is a company of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. and Cie, S.C.A. 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg. If the data subject selects “PayPal” as a payment option during the order process in our online shop, the data of the data subject will be automatically transmitted to PayPal.
</p>
<p>
  By selecting this payment option, the data subject consents to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing. The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually a first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number or other data required for payment processing.
</p>
<p>
  For the fulfilment of the purchase contract, those personal data, which are related to the respective order, are also necessary. Details on data protection at PayPal may be found at: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="extern" href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-prev">https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-prev</a>.

Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow your use of the website to be analysed. Google Analytics also uses, among other things, the DoubleClick cookie mentioned above, to target, optimise, and present ads based on previous visits by a user to our site. The cookie stores, among other things, information on the IP address, the browser type and the operating system of the requesting computer as well as the URL of the referring website.

  Social network social plugins 
</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Facebook</strong>: We use social plugins of the Facebook.com social network, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The Like button also uses such a social plugin. If such a plugin is called by our users, the user browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. As a result, the information on which Experteer websites were visited by the user is automatically transmitted to the Facebook server. For users who are logged in to Facebook, Facebook assigns this information automatically their personal Facebook account and stores them. A cookie may also possibly be installed on your computer, but deleted when the browser is closed. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further utilisation of the data by Facebook may be found in the Facebook Privacy Policy at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="extern" href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>.

<p>
  <strong>Twitter</strong>: On our website, we use features of the Twitter service offered by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. If you visit a website with a built-in Twitter button, and it is uploaded, Twitter will discover your IP address and that our website was visited via that IP address. In order to use Twitter, you need a Twitter account. If you are logged in to Twitter on your profile and click on the Twitter button on Experteer, you will share the content of the page in which the button is integrated with other Twitter users. Twitter will then remember that you have clicked this button along with information about the page and make that information available to other Twitter users. If you do not want Twitter to directly associate the data collected via our website to your Twitter profile, then you must log out of Twitter before visiting our website. For more information about data collection and utilisation by Twitter and your right related to it, please refer to the Privacy Policy of Twitter at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="extern" href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using the Shariff solution</strong>: We are glad if you recommend and discuss the contents of our pages on social media. For this, we use the buttons provided by the “Shariff” extension. Standard social media buttons transmit user data with each page view, and give the social networks accurate information about your browsing behaviour (user tracking). You do not have to be logged in or be a member of the network. The Shariff social button only creates direct contact between the social network and visitors when the latter actively clicks on the share button.  If the user is already logged in to a social network, this is done on Facebook without another window. On Twitter, a pop-up window appears where you can still edit the tweet. More information on this may be found at heise.de.
