If Customer does not agree to the Additional Restrictions, Customer may request a reduction in fees payable under the affected Order Form(s) by providing FullContact with written notice within thirty (30) days of FullContact giving Customer notice of the Additional Restrictions; provided if such request is not timely submitted by Customer, then such right will be deemed waived as it pertains to that instance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage Data and Feedback.</span> In connection with providing the FullContact Data Services, Customer acknowledges that FullContact has the right to create Usage Data and FullContact retains ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Usage Data. FullContact may use Usage Data to perform its obligations under the Agreement and for any other lawful business purpose, including, but not limited to, benchmarking, book keeping, data analysis, and to market and improve FullContact’s services, systems, and algorithms. Providing any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, corrections, or other feedback (collectively, “<strong>Feedback</strong>”) is strictly voluntary. Customer hereby grants to FullContact a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate any Feedback, orally or in writing, into the FullContact Data Services, APIs, or API Documentation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Customer Application and End User Use.</strong> If, pursuant to a Permitted Use, Customer makes the FullContact Data or the FullContact Data Services available to: (i) Third Party End Users through a Customer Application (which must be specified and described on an Order Form), the terms contained in <a href="#third-party-end-user-terms">Exhibit A</a> attached hereto shall apply; and (ii) Third Party End Users’ end users (“<strong>Fourth Party End Users</strong>”) through a Third Party End User Application, the terms contained in <a href="#fourth-party-end-user-terms">Exhibit B</a> attached hereto shall apply.</p>
<p><strong>4. Submitted Information.</strong> If Customer provides FullContact any Submitted Information, the following provisions shall apply to such Submitted Information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">License to Submitted Information.</span> Customer hereby grants FullContact a worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, limited-term license to use Submitted Information in connection with the provision of FullContact Data Services. FullContact will not resell or distribute any Submitted Information to FullContact’s customers generally or any other third party. Customer agrees that nothing contained in this Services Agreement shall restrict FullContact’s right to use, access, process, collect, disclose, share, or distribute any Personal Data that FullContact collects or receives from a different source other than Customer, even if such information is duplicative of any Submitted Information. Customer agrees that FullContact uses an identity graph and algorithmic processing to provide FullContact’s services that may be improved or trained by exposure to Submitted Information. Customer agrees that the outputs of such algorithms are FullContact’s Confidential Information; provided that such outputs will not contain any Submitted Information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submitted Information Representations.</span> Customer represents and warrants to FullContact that: (i) if Submitted Information is collected from customers or users of any Customer website or service, including Third Party End Users of a Customer Application, Customer will at all times maintain a Customer Privacy Policy that is associated with or linked to the Customer website, service, or Customer Application, which policy complies with all Applicable Laws and which clearly and accurately describes the processing, use and disclosure of Submitted Information as contemplated herein; (ii) Customer has obtained or possesses all rights necessary, including any third party consents required under Applicable Laws, to authorize FullContact to use the Submitted Information for the purposes contemplated hereunder and to grant FullContact the licenses set forth under Section 4(a) [Submitted Information]; (iii) Customer’s collection and disclosure of Submitted Information for the uses contemplated hereunder complies with all Applicable Laws and, if applicable, the Customer Privacy Policy; and (iv) Customer will promptly notify FullContact of any notice from any governmental agency or regulatory authority alleging that the use of any Submitted Information violates Applicable Law. Customer agrees not to transmit or upload to FullContact, and the Submitted Information will not include, any individually identifiable health information (as that term is defined in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended), payment card information, bank account information, social security number, driver’s license information, government ID information about any individual, or any similar sensitive information.</p>
<p><strong>5. Confidentiality and Security Requirements.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidential Information.</span> Each party agrees that all business, technical and financial information that is designated as “Confidential” or “Proprietary,” or is disclosed in a manner that a reasonable person would understand the confidentiality of the information disclosed is the confidential property of the disclosing party and its licensors (“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”). FullContact Data shall be considered the Confidential Information of FullContact, and Submitted Information shall be considered the Confidential Information of Customer. The receiving party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, except in connection with the exercise of rights granted or performance of such party’s obligations under the Agreement. The receiving party shall not be obligated under this Section5(a) [Confidential Information] with respect to information if the receiving party can document such information: (i)is or has become readily publicly available through no fault of the receiving party or its employees or agents; (ii)is received from a third party lawfully in possession of such information and the receiving party has no knowledge of any disclosure restrictions which prohibit such third party from disclosing such information; (iii) was rightfully in the possession of the receiving party without restriction prior to its disclosure by the other party; or (iv)was independently developed by employees or consultants of the receiving party without use of or reliance on such Confidential Information. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the receiving party gives the disclosing party prior notice of such compelled disclosure, to the extent legally permitted, and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party’s expense, if the disclosing party wishes to contest or limit such disclosure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security and Privacy of Personal Data.</span> Each party recognizes that any data received from the other party in connection with the FullContact Data Services may include Personal Data, which both parties desire to keep secure and free from unauthorized access or use. Accordingly, the receiving party shall: (i) provide commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to prevent security breaches or unauthorized access to such Personal Data; (ii) promptly notify the disclosing party of any breaches, or other unauthorized activities relative to the use of such Personal Data of which it becomes aware; and (iii) maintain complete and accurate books and records of account with respect to all of its activities under the Agreement and all disclosures and transactions relating to such Personal Data during the term and for a period of at least two (2) years after termination or expiration of the Agreement. Each party will comply with applicable obligations under the Applicable Laws and provide the same level of privacy protection to Personal Data as is required by Applicable Laws. Each party has the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that the receiving party uses the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with the disclosing party’s obligations under Applicable Laws. The receiving party will notify the disclosing party if the receiving party makes a determination that the receiving party can no longer meet its obligations under Applicable Laws. If the receiving party notifies the disclosing party of unauthorized use of Personal Data, the disclosing party will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate such unauthorized use by limiting the Personal Data shared with the other party, terminating the affected Order Form(s) relevant to such unauthorized use, or such other steps mutually agreed in writing. With regard to the processing of any Personal Data, each party shall comply with its obligations under the Data Processing Addendum, located at <a style="word-break: break-all;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/privacy/data-processing-addendum/">https://www.fullcontact.com/privacy/data-processing-addendum/</a>, which is incorporated into this Services Agreement by reference.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injunctive Relief.</span> Each party acknowledges that any unauthorized use of the other party’s Confidential Information will cause irreparable harm and injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. In addition to all other remedies, at law or in equity, each party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event the other party is in breach of the terms in this Section 5 [Confidentiality and Security Requirements].</p>
<p><strong>6. Fees; Payment Terms; Taxes.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fees</span>. Customer will pay all fees applicable to the FullContact Data or FullContact Data Services provided by FullContact as set forth in each Order Form entered into by the parties. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid or payable are non-refundable. If Customer’s consumption of FullContact Data Services exceeds the proportion of fees invoiced and paid under the applicable Order Form, then FullContact may accelerate future invoicing of fees to the extent needed to match Customer’s consumption.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invoices</span>. FullContact will issue invoices to Customer for all amounts payable, and such invoices shall be due within fifteen (15) days after invoice date unless otherwise provided in an Order Form.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Late Payment</span>. If Customer fails to pay any past due invoice within ten (10) days after Customer’s receipt of a past due notice from FullContact, FullContact may revoke or suspend FullContact Data Services until such time as Customer brings its account completely current. Any invoiced amounts not subject to a good faith dispute that are not paid when due will be subject to finance charges equal to 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month or the highest rate permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is less, determined and compounded monthly from the date due until the date paid. If Customer fails to timely pay an invoice as set forth in this Section 6 [Fees; Payment Terms; Taxes] or in the applicable Order Form on two (2) or more occasions, FullContact may, in addition to any other remedies that FullContact may have and upon written notice to Customer, modify the payment terms to require pre-payment of any or all fees payable under any Order Forms then outstanding or entered into in the future, or require other assurances to secure Customer’s payment obligations hereunder. Customer must notify FullContact of any disputed amounts in any invoice (in writing) no later than thirty (30) days after the invoice date, otherwise the amount invoice shall be conclusively deemed correct. Customer will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) incurred by FullContact to collect any amount that is not paid when due upon receipt of an invoice therefor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes</span>. Other than net income taxes imposed on FullContact, Customer will bear all taxes, duties, and other governmental charges with respect to the licenses and services provided under the Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>7. Term and Termination; Data Deletion; Survival.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term</span>. This Service Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and continue until the applicable Subscription Term for each Order Form made subject to this Service Agreement has expired, unless each Order Form is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the applicable Order Form or this Services Agreement is earlier terminated as set forth herein. Except as may otherwise be expressly specified in the Order Form, Order Form(s) will automatically renew for additional successive periods of equal duration to the initial Subscription Term stated in the Order Form unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the Subscription Term.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination for Cause</span>. Either party may terminate an Order Form or this Services Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice to the other party, if such party: (i) breaches any provision of the Agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice to such party; (ii) breaches a provision of the Agreement for which cure is impossible; or (iii) becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon the termination of this Services Agreement for any reason, all Order Forms made subject to it shall automatically terminate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effect of Termination</span>. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, (i) all license rights granted in the Agreement (and any associated licenses to Third Party End Users) will immediately cease to exist, and (ii) Customer will irrecoverably delete, and shall cause any Third Party End Users to delete, any and all FullContact Data and Customer will be required to execute the Data Deletion Acknowledgement in the form of <a href="#data-deletion-acknowledgement">Exhibit C</a> attached hereto; provided that Customer and any Third Party End Users will not be required to delete any data that was already in Customer’s possession prior to obtaining the same data from FullContact (as FullContact Data) hereunder, or any Derived Insights that has been derived from FullContact Data in compliance with the terms of the Agreement prior to the termination or expiration date. Termination for any reason (other than termination for cause by Customer pursuant to Section 7(b) [Termination for Cause]) shall not relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or payable to FullContact (including, if applicable, any committed fees for the remainder of the Subscription Term following the date of termination).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survival</span>. Sections 5 [Confidentiality and Security Requirements], 7(c) [Effect of Termination], 8 [Indemnity], 9(c) [Disclaimer], 10 [Limit of Liability], and 11 [General] of this Service Agreement, as well as Customer&#8217;s obligation to pay any fees applicable to the balance of the Customer&#8217;s then-current Subscription Term, will survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Records</span>. Customer will maintain business and financial records for a continuing (rolling) period of three years that contain information sufficient to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms of the Agreement, including: (i) that the use of FullContact Data complies with the Agreement; and (ii) following the termination of the Agreement, that the FullContact Data has been deleted in accordance with this Services Agreement. Without limitation to FullContact’s rights under any other provision hereof, Customer shall provide to FullContact, upon request, SQL logs in a form reasonably requested by FullContact as evidence to confirm the foregoing (“<strong>SQL Log Attestation</strong>”). If such SQL Log Attestation reveals that Customer is in violation of its obligations to delete FullContact Data from its records, then Customer shall, on demand, pay FullContact the proportionate amount of the fees, on a pro-rata basis, that would have been paid to maintain such FullContact Data identified in the SQL Log Attestation for the period of time between expiration or termination of the Subscription Term and the delivery of the SQL Log Attestation to FullContact.</p>
<p><strong>8. Indemnity.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indemnity by FullContact</span>. FullContact agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Customer (and its officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claims, demands, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings brought by a third party (“<strong>Claims</strong>”) and resulting judgments, settlements, damages, losses, costs, fees (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and court costs) and expenses (“<strong>Losses</strong>”) incurred by Customer to the extent due to or arising out of: (i) any allegation that FullContact Data, as provided to Customer by FullContact hereunder, used in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party; or (ii) FullContact’s violation of Applicable Laws in connection with its provision of FullContact Data Services and FullContact Data hereunder or its use of Submitted Information; excluding any such Claims to the extent based on or arising out of any cause or circumstance for which Customer must indemnify FullContact under Section 8(b) hereof [Indemnity by Customer]. In the event that any FullContact Data becomes subject to a Claim that is subject to the terms of this Section 8(a) [Indemnity by FullContact], FullContact shall at its option either: (A) modify the FullContact Data so as to avoid any alleged infringement or violation; (B) obtain any rights required to avoid such alleged infringement or violation; or (C) terminate this Services Agreement or any Order Form with respect to such FullContact Data and refund to Customer any prepaid fees applicable to the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term. This Section 8(a) [Indemnity by FullContact] states FullContact’s entire liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy for any Claims pertaining to the FullContact Data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indemnity by Customer</span>. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold FullContact (and its officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any Claims and all resulting Losses to the extent due to or arising out of: (i) Customer’s breach or violation of the terms of the Agreement; or (ii) Customer’s violation of Applicable Laws in connection with its activities hereunder or its use or distribution of FullContact Data, excluding any such Claims to the extent based on or arising out of any cause or circumstance for which FullContact must indemnify Customer under Section 8(a) [Indemnity by FullContact] hereof.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedure</span>. The indemnifying party’s obligations as set forth above are expressly conditioned upon each of the foregoing: (i) the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of any threatened or actual Claim, provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability hereunder (except to the extent the indemnifying party has suffered actual material prejudice by such failure); (ii) the indemnifying party having sole control of the defense or settlement of any Claim (provided the indemnifying party may not settle any Claim without the indemnified party’s consent unless it unconditionally releases the indemnified party of all liability); and (iii) the indemnified party (at the indemnifying party’s expense) reasonably cooperating with the indemnifying party to facilitate the defense or settlement of any Claim.</p>
<p><strong>9. Limited Warranty; Disclaimers.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited Service Warranty</span>. FullContact warrants during each applicable Subscription Term that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide FullContact Data Services and FullContact Data and any updates thereto in accordance with the requirements set forth in each Order Form. As Customer’s sole remedy and FullContact’s sole liability for a breach of the foregoing warranties, FullContact shall either: (i) re-perform the deficient FullContact Data Services or correct or replace any deficient FullContact Data, as applicable; or (ii) terminate this Services Agreement or any Order Form with respect to such FullContact Data Services or FullContact Data and refund to Customer any prepaid fees applicable to the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, FULLCONTACT’S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATED ORDER FORMS, EXHIBITS, OR ADDENDUMS), FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO AMOUNTS CUSTOMER HAS PAID FULLCONTACT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AROSE. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES WILL APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE INVALID, VOID OR UNENFORCEABLE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION ARE A BARGAINED-FOR EXCHANGE AND A MATERIAL CONDITION AND PREMISE OF THE AGREEMENT.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CUSTOMER APPLICATION AND THIRD PARTY END USER DATA USE TERMS</strong></h2>
<p>The terms in this Exhibit apply to the extent Customer makes the FullContact Data or the FullContact Data Services available to Third Party End Users through a Customer Application.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Application</span>. Customer is solely responsible and liable for the Customer Application and for supporting the Customer Application. Customer shall remain fully responsible for any breach of the terms of the Agreement by any Third Party End Users or any permitted third party through which any such Customer Application is distributed, licensed or sold. Customer agrees that at all times during the Subscription Term the Customer Application must provide significantly additional data, content and functionality than that provided by the FullContact Data alone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Application Policy</span>. The Customer Application shall not: (i) violate any third-party rights (including any intellectual property rights or individual privacy rights), any Applicable Laws (including any privacy laws), the Customer Privacy Policy (if applicable), or any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2(d) of the Services Agreement [Restrictions]; (ii) contain any tortious, threatening, harmful, defamatory or intentionally misleading, pornographic, obscene, or patently offensive content; (iii) promote racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; (iv) knowingly transmit or introduce any computer viruses, worms, or any software intended to interfere with, damage or alter a computer system or data; or (v) harvest, collect, gather or assemble information or data regarding any End User or other individuals, including email addresses, without their consent (collectively, the “<strong>Customer Application Policy</strong>”). FullContact shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time to monitor the Customer Application at any time and may reject the Customer Application and immediately cease to provide FullContact Data for use in the Customer Application if it determines, in good faith, that such Customer Application does not comply with the Customer Application Policy or does not satisfy any of the other criteria or requirements set forth herein. Compliance with this Section is a condition of the licenses in the Agreement and a material requirement of the Agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party End User Agreement</span>.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exhibit B</strong></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIRD PARTY END USER APPLICATION AND FOURTH PARTY END USER DATA USE TERMS</strong></h2>
<p>The terms in this Exhibit apply to the extent that Third Party End Users make the FullContact Data available to Fourth Party End Users through a Third Party End User Application.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party End User Application and Application Policy</span>. A “<strong>Third Party End User Application</strong>” is any application offered by Third Party End User, though which any Fourth Party End User accesses and uses FullContact Data, which may include, but not limited to, through software applications or web-based services or through electronic or written files or reports. The Third Party End User Application shall not: (i) violate any third-party rights (including any intellectual property rights or individual privacy rights), any Applicable Laws (including any privacy laws), or any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2(d) of the Services Agreement [Restrictions] (collectively, the “<strong>Third Party End User Application Policy</strong>”). A Third Party End User Application must provide significantly additional data, content and functionality than that provided by the FullContact Data alone. FullContact shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time to monitor the Third Party End User Application at any time and may reject the Third Party End User Application and immediately cease to provide FullContact Data for use in the Third Party End User Application if it determines, in good faith, that such Third Party End User Application does not comply with the Customer Application Policy or does not satisfy any of the other criteria or requirements set forth herein.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth Party End User Agreement</span>. Customer will ensure that Fourth Party End Users are subject to a written agreement (the “<strong>Fourth Party End User Agreement</strong>”) that contains restrictions and limitations on the Fourth Party End User’s use of the FullContact Data and FullContact Data Services consistent with the Agreement, including the following terms: (i) the Fourth Party End User agrees not to use any FullContact Data (whether alone or in combination with any other data) or the FullContact Data Services in any manner that violates any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2(d) of the Services Agreement [Restrictions] or the applicable Order Form; (ii) access to FullContact Data must be restricted to only those Fourth Party End Users who are using it for a Permitted Use; (iii) all rights to FullContact Data and FullContact Data Services automatically terminate upon termination of the applicable Subscription Term or upon the earlier termination of the applicable Order Form or this Services Agreement; (iv) the Fourth Party End User agrees to delete all FullContact Data upon termination of the license, other than any Derived Insights that has been derived from FullContact Data prior to the termination or expiration date in compliance with the terms of this Services Agreement; (v) if Submitted Information is provided to FullContact by Customer, the Fourth Party End User grants to Customer all rights (including consents and licenses) to any Submitted Information that the Fourth Party End User provides to Customer that are necessary for Customer to grant FullContact the license to use its Submitted Information (as described in Section 4(a) of this Services Agreement [Submitted Information]); and (vi) to not resell or redistribute any FullContact Data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cooperation</span>. Upon request, Customer will provide FullContact with: (i) a copy of each Fourth Party End User Application Agreement; (ii) such information regarding each Fourth Party End User as may be reasonably required by FullContact to determine such Fourth Party End User’s compliance with this Exhibit; and (iii) such additional assistance as may be required to enforce any of the obligations contained in this Exhibit. Customer assumes responsibility and liability for its Fourth Party End Users. Customer will immediately notify FullContact upon becoming aware of any breach of the restrictions in this Exhibit, and will use reasonable efforts to have the Third Party End User enforce the terms of each applicable Fourth Party End User Application Agreement against any Fourth Party End User on FullContact’s ultimate behalf. Customer shall remain fully responsible for any breach of the terms of the Agreement by any Fourth Party End User.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effect of Termination</span>. Section 7(c) of this Services Agreement [Effect of Termination] shall apply to Fourth Party End Users just as it applies to Third Party End Users and Customer. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Customer shall cause any Third Party End Users and its Fourth Party End Users to delete, any and all FullContact Data and Customer will be required to execute the Data Deletion Acknowledgement on behalf of itself, any Third Party End Users, and each of their Fourth Party End Users.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">End User Claim</span>. Section 8(b) of this Services Agreement [Indemnity by Customer] is amended to include an additional Claim for Losses due to or arising out of any Third Party End User’s breach of this Exhibit, use of the End User Application, or violation of Applicable Laws. The obligations contained in this Section shall be in addition to and not limit the obligations contained in Section 8(b) of this Services Agreement [Indemnity by Customer].</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exhibit C</strong></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>DATA DELETION ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong></h2>
<p>This Data Deletion Acknowledgment is being provided by Customer pursuant to the requirements of that certain Services Agreement entered into by and between Customer and FullContact, upon expiration or termination of the Agreement.
