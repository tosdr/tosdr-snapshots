                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>

                            <li style="color: #ffffff;">We respect your rights, in particular your rights to access and modification of your data.</li>
                            <li style="color: #ffffff;">We do not look at personal data as an asset, but as a liability.</li>
                            <li style="color: #ffffff;">We only store personal data when it is needed, either for our services to operate properly, or to comply with the law.</li>

                    <h2 class="title is-4">Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <p>We tend to build our tools from scratch in order to respect your privacy, but we also need to rely on a few products.

                    <h4 class="title is-6">Torrent Clients</h4>
                    <p>We use the Transmission-CLI and Transmission Web Interface to seed torrents. Such tools may display your Internet Protocol (IP) address to us, but we do not track nor collect in any way those addresses.</p>

                    <h4 class="title is-6">Google Adsense</h4>
