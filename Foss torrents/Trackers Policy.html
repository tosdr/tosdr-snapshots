                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>

                    <h2 class="title is-4">Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <p>We tend to build our tools from scratch in order to respect your privacy, but we also need to rely on a few products.

This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address or unique device identifier. This information is stored in secure logs and is collected automatically.</p>

                    <h4 class="title is-6">Torrent Clients</h4>
                    <p>We use the Transmission-CLI and Transmission Web Interface to seed torrents. Such tools may display your Internet Protocol (IP) address to us, but we do not track nor collect in any way those addresses.</p>

                    <h4 class="title is-6">Google Adsense</h4>
