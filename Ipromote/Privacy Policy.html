                <p>Last Update: 07/09/2024</p>

This Privacy Policy also relates to iPromote’s obligations under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, shall jointly be referred as: “DPF Obligations”).</p>
				<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy is an integral part of our Terms of Use (available at: <a href="/terms/">https://www.ipromote.com/terms/</a>). If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and to the data collection practices we describe here, please do not use or in any other way engage with our services. Please make sure you read the Privacy Policy carefully, understand it and consent to its terms.</p>

                <h4>Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
                <p>Like most digital marketing solutions, iPromote uses "cookies" and other technologies to enhance users' experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting. We cannot use these technologies to personally identify you, and these technologies do not damage your system or files. iPromote uses these technologies to help recognize a unique computer or device so we are able to deliver relevant advertising and measure the impact of that advertising. The types of technologies used include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies &ndash; Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters. iPromote uses cookies to change the sequence of the ad banners that are delivered to your web browser and to limit the number of times your web browser receives the same advertisement. Cookies are also used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign, the number of times an ad is clicked on, and how many Web surfers visit an Advertiser's website.</li>
                    <li>Web Beacons &ndash; Web Beacons are used to help web publishers understand how visitors interact with their websites. Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site. The use of a pixel tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tag.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>iPromote uses cookies and pixel tags primarily to: (i) report to iPromote's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign; (ii) report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user and other measurement statistics; (iii) ensure that an ad displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination; (iv) deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; (v) deliver advertisements that fall within certain categories such as sports, music, travel, food, etc.; and (vi) limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement. iPromote does not share personal information with third parties, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h4>Your Choices</h4>
                <p>iPromote firmly believes that every individual who uses the Internet should be able to make informed decisions with respect to individual privacy matters, including the use of cookies. Thus, we are happy to provide you with a number of choices. You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser.

We also request that all Web sites using our advertising network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection of information from children.

Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.</p>

				<p>iPromote may transfer the information it collects (including any Personal Information) outside the country in which it is collected or in which you reside, including to a country that may not offer the same level of protection for Personal Information as the country in which you reside.

				<p>Except as otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or contract, iPromote reserves the right to publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate, or summary information regarding users and campaigns run on behalf of our clients.
