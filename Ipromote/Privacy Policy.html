				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Last Update: 05/09/2024</p>
				<p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices of iPromote.</p>
				<p>2KDirect, Inc., a Delaware corporation, doing business as iPromote, ("we", "us" or "iPromote") are very concerned about end users' ("Users", "End Users", "Web User" or "Web Surfers") privacy.

This Privacy Policy also relates to iPromote’s obligations under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, shall jointly be referred as: “DPF Obligations”).</p>
				<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy is an integral part of our Terms of Use (available at: <a href="/terms/">https://www.ipromote.com/terms/</a>). If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and to the data collection practices we describe here, please do not use or in any other way engage with our services. Please make sure you read the Privacy Policy carefully, understand it and consent to its terms.</p>

				<h4>iPromote and The Collection of Personal Information (Notice)</h4>
				<p>The term "Personal Information" means information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify a natural person, (e.g., first and last names, email address, phone number and contact information).

					<li>Device, and connection information: device manufacturer, its model, its operating system information including its version and type of connection, its IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, the device's unique identifiers, geolocation marker and Internet service provider;</li>
					<li>Information about your activity: visits to our or our Entities' apps and pages and statistical information on the number of visits or use, ad views, ad clicks, the ads location and type and retargeting data, which reveals previous interest in a product, app or website;</li>

                    <li>iPromote's Clients: iPromote may share your information when it operates as a service provider and enters into a contract with its clients. iPromote’s contract provides that such data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and that the recipient will provide the same level of protection under the DPF Obligations and applicable data privacy rules, and will notify the client if it a determination is made that it can no longer meet this obligation.

                    <li>Legal Requirement: iPromote will share your information if it is required to do so in order to comply with the DPF Obligations and any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request (e.g., to comply with a court order, comply with tax authorities, pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, etc.);</li>
                    <li>Third Party Service Providers: iPromote may disclose your information to trusted service providers in order to perform requested services on iPromote's behalf.

                    <li>Business Transfers: iPromote may share personal information in the event of a corporate transaction (e.g. sale of a substantial part of our business, merger, consolidation or asset sale). In the event of the above, the affiliated companies or acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy;</li>
                    <li>Online Identifiers: iPromote may share online identifiers with our advertising partner's and to detect fraud.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>iPromote reserves the right to use, disclose or transfer (for business purposes or otherwise) aggregated and processed Non-Personal Data to third parties, including affiliates, for various purposes including commercial use. This information may be collected, processed and analyzed by iPromote and transferred in a combined, collectively and aggregated manner (i.e., your information is immediately aggregated with other users) to third parties.</p>

                <h4>Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
                <p>Like most digital marketing solutions, iPromote uses "cookies" and other technologies to enhance users' experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting. We cannot use these technologies to personally identify you, and these technologies do not damage your system or files. iPromote uses these technologies to help recognize a unique computer or device so we are able to deliver relevant advertising and measure the impact of that advertising. The types of technologies used include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies &ndash; Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters. iPromote uses cookies to change the sequence of the ad banners that are delivered to your web browser and to limit the number of times your web browser receives the same advertisement. Cookies are also used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign, the number of times an ad is clicked on, and how many Web surfers visit an Advertiser's website.</li>
                    <li>Web Beacons &ndash; Web Beacons are used to help web publishers understand how visitors interact with their websites. Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site. The use of a pixel tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tag.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>iPromote uses cookies and pixel tags primarily to: (i) report to iPromote's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign; (ii) report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user and other measurement statistics; (iii) ensure that an ad displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination; (iv) deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; (v) deliver advertisements that fall within certain categories such as sports, music, travel, food, etc.; and (vi) limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement. iPromote does not share personal information with third parties, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h4>Your Choices</h4>
                <p>iPromote firmly believes that every individual who uses the Internet should be able to make informed decisions with respect to individual privacy matters, including the use of cookies. Thus, we are happy to provide you with a number of choices. You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. You can also opt to be warned before a cookie is put on your computer.

                <h4>Children's Privacy and Spam</h4>
				<p>As of April 21, 2000 the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 12. iPromote is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. iPromote's Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If you believe your child has provided iPromote with any personally identifiable data by registering at iPromote's Web site, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ipromote.com">privacy@ipromote.com</a> to have the data removed. We also request that all Web sites using our advertising network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection of information from children. In addition to the above, iPromote is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 7701).</p>

				<p>Any Personal Information that we may collect according to this Privacy Policy is handled and treated in compliance with the EU general data protection regulation and in accordance to the DPF Obligation.</p>

				<h4>Security</h4>
				<p>iPromote takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>). iPromote also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.</p>

				<h4>Cross-Border Data Transmission</h4>
				<p>iPromote may transfer the information it collects (including any Personal Information) outside the country in which it is collected or in which you reside, including to a country that may not offer the same level of protection for Personal Information as the country in which you reside. In such cases, we ensure to implement contractual safeguards to make sure the processed information receives an adequate level of protection when it is transferred between or among third party vendors, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the safeguards provided by the DPF Obligations. By providing Personal Information and engaging our services, you expressly consent to our use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of your information to another country.</p>

				<h4>Disclosure</h4>
				<p>Except as otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or contract, iPromote reserves the right to publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate, or summary information regarding users and campaigns run on behalf of our clients. We may share user-level data with clients. There also may be instances when we disclose information in our systems in order to protect the legal rights of iPromote or its employees, agents, and contractors; protect the safety and security of users and visitors to our Website; protect against fraud; or to comply with the law or legal process. If iPromote sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer information in our systems to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>
