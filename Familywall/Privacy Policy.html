<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Family &amp; Co respects your privacy. Family &amp; Co SAS, with headquarters at 16, rue Théodore de Banville, 75017, Paris, France, including its affiliates ("Family &amp; Co") provides this Privacy Statement (the "Statement") to help you understand how Family &amp; Co collects and uses the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each as defined below) you submit to or which is collected by Family &amp; Co via Family &amp; Co’s service called FamilyWall at <a href="https://www.familywall.com">www.familywall.com</a> or through FamilyWall mobile applications (the "Service"), including any club or forum offered through the Service or that is collected when you visit the Service. "You" means an individual who accesses or uses the Service.
This Statement only governs the collection, storage, use and disclosure of information collected through the Service. It does not apply to information collected by Family &amp; Co in other ways (for example, from third parties) or through other Family &amp; Co websites or services, and it does not modify or alter other agreements you may have, or enter later, with Family &amp; Co.


<p>For example, if Family &amp; Co collects information about you from third party sources, the collection, storage, use and disclosure of that information will be governed by Family &amp; Co’s agreement with you or the third party source, unless the privacy statement of a third party source indicates that this Statement will govern Family &amp; Co’s use of the information that the third party source provides to Family &amp; Co.</p>


<p>Also, if you provide Personal Information to Family &amp; Co through other means, such as when you call customer service or send Personal Information related to promotions or product registrations via postal mail, this Statement does not apply to that information.</p>


<p>You acknowledge and agree that this Statement has the same effect as a written consent. By accessing or using the Service or providing information to Family &amp; Co through the Service, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the content of this Statement and consent to the practices described in this Statement.</p>


<h2>1. Information that Family &amp; Co Collects</h2>

	<p>When you visit the Service, Family &amp; Co collects certain Personal Information, as well as Non-Personal Information.</p>

	<h3>Personal Information</h3>

		<p>In this Statement, “Personal Information” means any information about an identifiable individual, as further defined under applicable laws. Family &amp; Co collects Personal Information when you submit it to the Service (for example when you sign up for or when you email invite other members). The Personal Information collected may include your name, birth date, address, mobile, phone, or fax number, email address, IP address, account information (such as account and online registration), online activities, and other specific personal information. In some cases, if Family &amp; Co asks you to provide Personal Information, the provision of that information will be mandatory to participate in a particular activity, service or promotion. If you do not provide this Personal Information, your participation in that activity, service or promotion may be limited or prohibited. For example, if you choose not to provide your Personal Information in a required field when you sign-up for a club membership, you may not become a club member of Family &amp; Co.</p>

	<h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>

		<p>Family &amp; Co also collects certain “Non-Personal Information,” which means data in a form that does not include direct or indirect association with an identifiable individual, such as gender, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location and time zone where an Family &amp; Co product or service is used, and information about customer activities on the Service, to allow Family &amp; Co to better understand customer behavior and improve Family &amp; Co’s services, products and advertising. Family &amp; Co collects some of this Non-Personal Information automatically when you visit the Service (Ad ID, IDFA, Google Advertising ID). If Non-Personal Information is combined with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>


	<h3>Voluntary Disclosure</h3>

		<p>Where you voluntarily disclose additional personal information without being prompted by Family &amp; Co and Family &amp; Co is not made aware that it should take special care in handling such information, then Family &amp; Co will not be held liable for that information under this Privacy Statement unless and to the extent that Family &amp; Co is obliged to use and protect such information pursuant to and in accordance with applicable law.</p>


	<h3>Location Services</h3>

		<p>Family &amp; Co and its partners may collect, use, transmit, process, store and share your precise location through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation for the purposes of providing our Service. This information may include but is not limited to your device ID and name, device type and real-time geographic location of your device. You may also be able to submit to Family &amp; Co location data such as “Places,” and other information. Family &amp; Co may also supplement the information it collects with information obtained from other companies. Family &amp; Co does not share geographic location data with application providers. By enabling or using the location-based services or features (such as displaying your phone location, posting Footprints, etc.) and applications that depend on location-based information, you agree and consent to Family &amp; Co collecting, using, transmitting, processing, storing and sharing information related to your account and the devices registered to your account for purposes of providing such location-based services or features to you. You may withdraw this consent by turning off the "Locate" function in the location settings (as applicable) on your device. The "Family Map" feature is intended for your personal use only to locate the last explicit position of the family members. The location-based services are not intended or suitable for use as an emergency locator system as the location display may be imprecise or not valid anymore.</p>


<h2>2. Family &amp; Co’s Use of Information</h2>

	<p>	Family &amp; Co will only use Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Statement, with your consent or as required or permitted by law. Consent may be express or implied, and given in writing, by using or not using a check-off box, electronically, orally, or by your conduct, such as by visiting the Service and by using services or products offered through the Service. You agree that the consent given electronically should have the same effect as that given in writing. In some jurisdictions implied consent is not sufficient, in which case, express consent will be required.</p>

	<ul type=disc>
		<li>to enable the features you are using;</li>

		<li>to detect fraud and abuse, and as otherwise described in the Service Terms and Conditions, and if you have an Family &amp; Co device, your End User License Agreement.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Family &amp; Co may also process, access, use, store and disclose Personal Information to enforce the terms and policies governing your use of the Service (including investigation of any potential violation), to detect or prevent security breaches, fraudulent activity or technical issues, to protect the rights or property of Family &amp; Co and its customers.</p>

Personal information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the EEA, USA and any other country in which Family &amp; Co or its service providers maintain facilities. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer, recording and storage of information outside of the country where you reside.</p>

	<p>While in another jurisdiction for processing, the information may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities. Family &amp; Co may use your Personal Information from the day you submit it to the day it is deleted, whether as a result of deletion due to a request by you to delete it, or for another reason.</p>

	<p>Family &amp; Co retains your Personal Data until it is no longer necessary to provide you with the Service, or until your account is deleted.</p>


<h2>3. Sharing Personal Information</h2>

Family &amp; Co may disclose the Personal Information described in Section 1 of this Statement to its third party service providers so they may complete transactions or perform services on Family &amp; Co’s behalf, transactions on your behalf, or transactions related to providing services to you. For example, Family &amp; Co may contract with third parties to host the Service, collect and provide product reviews, provide promotions or surveys, send Family &amp; Co’s emails, and fulfill product orders and promotions.</p>

	<p>Family &amp; Co will use contractual agreements to protect Personal Information disclosed to third party services providers.
