	<li id="section12">
	<strong>Disclaimer of Certain Damages.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Family &amp; Co or any supplier be liable for (a) any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages; or (b) damages for loss of profits or confidential or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, property damage, for loss of privacy, for failure to meet any duty of good faith or reasonable care or for negligence, in (a) and (b) arising out of, based on, resulting from or in any way related to these Terms, the Service, your use of the Service, Linked Services, Family &amp; Co Content, Third Party Materials or Services, even if Family &amp; Co or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or of damages for personal injury, so the above limitations or exclusions of damages may not apply to you.
	</li><br>
	
	<li id="section13">
	<strong>Limitation of Liability and Exclusive Remedy.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Family &amp; Co’s and its suppliers’ maximum, aggregate liability to you, and your exclusive remedy under these Terms for any and all damages, injury, property damage and losses arising from any and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based on, resulting from or in any way related to these Terms, the Service, Linked Services, Family &amp; Co Content, Third Party Materials, Services or your use of the Service will be to recover the actual damages you incur based upon reasonable reliance on the Service up to five Euros (5.00€). The existence of multiple claims or suits under or related to these Terms, the Service, Linked Services, Family &amp; Co Content, Third Party Materials or Service will not enlarge or extend the limitation of money damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, these actual money damages will be your sole remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain contract terms. If a court of competent jurisdiction deems the above liability cap unenforceable, it will, to that extent, not be applicable but instead the words "up to five Euros (5.00€)" will be deemed replaced by the words "up to the value of the transaction in respect of which liability has arisen." Nothing in this Section 12 will be interpreted as purporting to exclude liability which cannot under prevailing legislation be excluded, but any such statutory entitlement available to you will be deemed limited to the extent (if at all) permissible under such legislation.
	</li><br>
	
	<li id="section14">
	<strong>Indemnity.</strong> You will defend, indemnify and hold Family &amp; Co, its directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, suppliers and licensors harmless from any third party claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, relating to or arising from (a) any User Content submitted, posted, transmitted or otherwise made available under your account using the Service or a Service; (b) your use of the Service or Service and activities occurring using your account information; (c) any violation by you of the Terms; and (d) your violation of any third party rights. This indemnification will survive the termination or expiration of the Terms and your use of the Service or Service.
	</li><br>
	
	<li id="section15">
	<strong>Independent Remedies.</strong> The exclusion of damages under <a href="#section11">Section 11</a> is independent of your exclusive remedy in <a href="#section12">Section 12</a> and it survives even if the exclusive remedy fails of its essential purpose or otherwise is deemed unenforceable. Each of these limitations of liability in Sections 11 and 12 apply without regard to whether damages arise from (a) breach of contract, (b) breach of warranty, (c) fault or tort, including negligence and misrepresentation, (d) strict liability or (e) any other cause of action, to the extent the exclusions and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law.

	<strong>A.</strong>If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, then it will replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect. The section titles in these Terms are used only for the parties’ convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. Family &amp; Co may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms or assign, transfer, or sublicense your rights, if any, in the Service. Family &amp; Co’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms (including the Privacy Statement, Code of Conduct and any other incorporated terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and Family &amp; Co with respect to the Service. These Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and Family &amp; Co with respect to the Service. Any translation of the Terms is done for local requirements. If there is a dispute between the English and the French version, the <a href="https://familywall.com/terms.html?lang=fr"> French version of the Terms</a> will govern.

Family &amp; Co reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.
