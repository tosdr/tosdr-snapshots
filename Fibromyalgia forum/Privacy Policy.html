</h2>
<p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>
<ul>
<li>We retain all of the information that you provide as part of using our services, with a few exceptions:</li>
<li>We may delete your account in line with our Terms of Service. If we delete your account, we may delete all of the personal information associated with that account, including your Content and Private Messages.</li>
<li>We may anonymise your account. This action removes your personal data other than your Content and your Private Messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to leave the site community within 60 days of joining and you ask us to close your account, we may delete the account or anonymise it.</p>
<p>If you decide to leave the site community and ask us to close your account more than 60 days after joining, we will anonymise your account, not delete it. This helps other members of the community by retaining full conversations. Where members leave and their Content is deleted, this creates holes in the conversation that no longer make sense and no longer act as providing support to other members.</p>
<p>While you remain a member of our community, you are able to edit or delete your own Content and Private Messages and it is your responsibility to keep that Content and those Private Messages in line with our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We may choose to delete Content or Private Messages a number of years after it was first posted in order to manage our costs. At this point in time, we do not set a time limit after which we delete this information.</p>
