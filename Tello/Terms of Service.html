					<h2>Use of service</h2>
					<div>By using Tello Services, the user accepts the rates, Terms and Conditions and procedures on this website. Tello may change or modify the Terms and Conditions from time to time without notice other than posting amended Terms and Conditions on this Website. Tello reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any portion thereof), including any and all content contained on the Website, at any time without notice.

<strong>Active phones & phone numbers</strong><br><br>

If a Customer enrolls a new SIM on a line with an existing active number, the Tello Service will no longer be active on the previous SIM enrolled on that line and will be available only on the newly enrolled SIM. An active number can only be connected to one SIM, so Tello Customers can only enjoy the Tello Service on one single SIM per line.
When a line is no longer active, Tello will re-assign the phone number associated with that line, and that phone number may no longer be available to the previous account holder, unless the Customer has ported the number to a third-party carrier consistent with applicable law and Tello policies.
<br><br>


<strong>Billing policy</strong><br><br>

All sessions (data, calls) are debited directly from your balance (Plan or Pay As You Go) as soon as the records for the sessions are available from our providers. Taking this into account, delays in charges may appear.<br><br>

Whatever the delay, charges will be deducted from the available balance (Plan or Pay As You Go) or, if the balance is not enough, as soon as the account balance gets updated (Plan renewal, Plan purchase or Pay As You Go Top Up). You acknowledge
and agree that the rates for any Service, including Service to or from any country, may
change from time to time, and that such changes will be reflected in the charges that
are deducted from your account balance.<br><br>

For example, a session (data, call) initiated on the last day of a national plan may be charged one day later and therefore, it will be debited from the balance of the newly renewed plan.<br>
If the plan is not renewed, then the unbilled sessions (data, calls) are debited from another existing balance (Plan or Pay As You Go).<br>
If there is no existing balance available (Plan or Pay As You Go), the unbilled sessions will be charged when the customer buys a plan or makes a top up.<br><br>


<strong> Billing Cycle</strong><br>
You agree to pay all charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed
through your Device. All Tello, LLC Service plans are measured on 30-day
monthly cycles (including for purposes of determining your data usage levels).<br><br>

We may offer you the opportunity to set up automatic payments through the
method of payment on your account, which payments will be automatically
charged at the end of your applicable payment cycle (âAuto Renewâ). When
you enroll in Auto Renew, automatic payments for plan fees that you incur will
continue until you cancel.<br><br>

The recurring charge may vary if you change your plan or we change our
prices, following notice to you. You may cancel Auto Renew or review your
payment preferences at any time by (i) contacting our customer service
department at 1-866-377-0294, or (ii) managing your account preferences on
the Tello website. You must change your Auto Renew preferences or cancel
24 hours prior to the end of your payment cycle in order for the change to go
into effect. No minimum purchase is necessary to enroll in Auto Renew.<br><br>

<strong>Wi-Fi E911</strong><br>
This Disclosure informs Tello, LLC customers of differences between the 911 and E911 access
capabilities available with the Tello, LLC Wi-Fi calling service (the âWi-Fi 911 Serviceâ) and the
911 and E911 access capability available with traditional wired telephone service. It is important
that you understand how these differences affect your ability to access 911 and E911
services.<br>Â PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE INFORMATION BELOW. IT CONTAINS
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING LIMITATIONS OF 911 FUNCTIONALITY. YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE THESE LIMITATIONS AND AGREE TO SHARE THESE LIMITATIONS WITH
ANYONE WHO MAY USE YOUR SERVICE TO PLACE CALLS OR SEND TEXTS.<br><br>

911 services are provided by your state and local government. Tello, LLC handsets are capable
of making calls to 911 in the United States, and 911 access is available to customers regardless
of your Rate Plan. The handset must have battery power and network connectivity to complete
a 911 call. Although Tello, LLC is often capable of communicating your phone number and/or
current location to a public safety answering point (â911 Communications Centerâ), in some
cases, 911 Communications Center operators may not know your phone number or have
information about your current location. As a result, when making 911 calls, you should provide
your contact information and current location. Other third-party entities are involved in
connecting a 911 call and Tello, LLC is not solely responsible for determining which 911
Communications Center your 911 call may be routed to. If you are porting a phone number to or
from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 911 location services
while the port is in process.Â  If you are porting a phone number to us, it is your obligation and
responsibility to make certain that all information forwarded from the port out carrier is accurate
and complete. If you are outside the U.S., you may have to dial a different number than 911 to
call emergency services.<br><br>


Wi-Fi 911 service is dependent on a functioning Wi-Fi connection. Without a Wi-Fi connection, the Wi-Fi
911 service will not work. Wi-Fi 911 service will not operate during power outages or if your Wi-Fi
connection is disrupted. In case of emergencies, it is recommended that customers have a redundant
or backup internet connection, an uninterruptible backup power supply, and/or a landline telephone.<br><br>
NEITHER TELLO, LLC NOR ITS NETWORK SUPPLIER IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR
ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY WI-FI CALLING MADE
AVAILABLE TO YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY FAILURE OF EMERGENCY
CALLS (WHETHER 9-1-1 CALLS OR OTHERWISE).<br><br>

The customer will need to provide Tello, LLC with the correct service address to route 911 calls
to the customer. When Wi-Fi 911 service is used, the phone call is routed to Tello, LLC which is
then routed to the local emergency service provider. Tello, LLC does not track the location of
the customer so Tello, LLC will depend on the correct service address to forward to emergency
services.<br>
If the customer makes a Wi-Fi 911 call and the customer is not at the correct service address,
the customer will have to give emergency responders current location information otherwise,
emergency responders will not be able to locate the customer.<br>
Since WiFi 911 calls route through Tello, LLC, emergency personnel may not be able to identify
the customer's phone number to call back the customer.<br><br>

Since WiFi 911 calls depend on a Wi-Fi connection, customers should be aware that calls could
drop or be delayed due to Wi-Fi connections being disrupted.<br>
It is recommended that customers always maintain alternate means of contacting 911.</div>

We reserve the right to add new types of uses we consider unacceptable.

But the list of permitted uses is so broad and generous, that you donât need to worry. In fact, the unacceptable uses usually conflict with applicable law, so we are also trying to protect you against legal problems. <br><br>

<strong>Violation of Acceptable Use Policy</strong> <br> No refunds will be provided if the service is terminated for violation of the acceptable use policy.<br><br> 

<strong>Performance with Telloâs "Unlimited" plan</strong><br>
The Unlimited data option provides unlimited data usage at a regular monthly rate per line (promotional rates may vary). Customers will receive 4G LTE/5G data speeds for up to 35 GB of data per billing period. Your data speed will be reduced to lower speeds once you have used 35 GB of data in a billing period. You can downgrade your unlimited plan at any time, with no change fees.<br>
Tello Unlimited Plans with international long-distance service are provided solely for live dialogue between and initiated by, two individuals for personal use and not for non-residential use or resale. The limit for international calls is set at 1000 min/30-day billing cycle and this balance is not rolled over. In case of abuse of usage, we reserve the right to suspend, terminate or restrict your ILD Services without any prior notice. We further
reserve the right to add or remove countries from the list of those for which Unlimited
Plans are available, to discontinue Services to any country, or to revise the number of
minutes.

Network Management<br> 
Generally, Tello does not inhibit the ability of our Customers to use mobile data.
However, like many service providers, Telloemploys reasonable network management
practices consistent with industry standards to maintain the reliability of its network and
minimize network issues and complications, and these practices are subject to
change. Specifically, Tello currently manages its network in the following ways:
<ul><li>Traffic identified as malicious (such as distributed denial of service attacks) may be automatically identified and blocked </li>
<li>In the event of network congestion in which the supporting technology determines that Service is likely to be degraded for Customers, Tello manages its network resources to prioritize certain communications in order to avoid disruption of those Services. Otherwise, network management is non-discriminatory and agnostic to the application.</li>
<li>Certain Services are subject to limitations, detailed herein.</li></ul></div>

						<h2>Pay As You Go Service Agreement</h2>
						<div>Pay As You Go credit is available for a period of 90 days since Customer's last Pay As You Go order. If no order was placed in a period of 90 days, Pay As You Go credit will expire and the Tello Service will be disconnected.<br><br>
Calls are billed in increments of one minute, with fractions thereof rounded up to the next minute.<br>

Data usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session. <br>

All sales are final. Balances once credited are non-refundable, non-transferable and non-exchangeable. <br>

						<h2>International Roaming Service Agreement</h2>
						<div>Customers may use international roaming to make calls, send SMS, and access data when traveling outside of the U.S. International roaming service is only available in select countries and exclusively with Pay As You Go credit. Customers without a Pay As You Go balance cannot access this feature. International roaming service costs are deducted from the Customerâs Pay As You Go balance. Customers must have at least $5 available in their Pay As You Go credit balance to activate international roaming service. All calls are billed on a per-minute basis. Messaging rates are per message. Data rates vary. Charges apply for incoming and outgoing calls while roaming. No set-up or activation fees apply. International roaming will not trigger the Auto-Recharge feature.<br><br>

International roaming rates can be found <a href="/international_roaming">here</a>. In addition, when entering a new country where international roaming is available, the Customer will receive a text message from Tello advising the Customer of the availability of international roaming and listing current rates for calls, SMS/texting, and data usage. International roaming rates may change at any time without prior notice to Customers. Calling to premium numbers is not available.<br><br>

Customers need to activate international roaming by turning this feature to âONâ in their account Settings. If a Customer makes calls, sends text, or uses data when traveling in a country where international roaming is available, costs of this usage will be automatically deducted from the Customerâs Pay as You Go balance. However, international roaming will be unavailable if the Customer turns this feature off. To turn off the feature, the Customer must log into their account and set the international roaming option to âOFF.â Turning this feature off will block all service usage when traveling internationally. If the Customer wishes to turn off only Data and MMS, they can switch off the Pay As You Go 4G LTE Data feature, also available in their Tello account.<br><br>

Tello relies on partners to provide the international roaming services. At times, Tello may experience a delay in the receipt of usage data from its carrier partners. As a result, Customers may notice a delay in updates to their Pay As You Go balances related to international roaming service usage. Pay As You Go balances will be updated within three (3) days of each instance of usage of international roaming service in a specific country.  Customers will receive an SMS notification when their Pay as You Go balance is running low. However, due to carrier delays, the Customers' Pay As You Go balance may not accurately reflect usage within the last three (3) days. As a result, the Customer's account may show a balance, but the Customer does not actually have any funds to use. Similarly, if the Customer requests a refund (for any valid reason) before the Pay As You Go balance has been posted, the Customerâs refund may either be denied or delayed until the Pay As You Go balance has been updated. Tello will not be liable to Customers for any claims relating to delays in posting of balances while roaming, Customersâ failure to receive timely SMS (including messages from Tello), or coverage or quality of service issues while roaming. Customers can access voicemails abroad by calling their own numbers in international format and entering their voicemail code to listen to messages.<br><br>

Local emergency services are available with international roaming.<br><br>

The international roaming service is subject to the general Terms & Conditions applicable to Tello's service offerings, including its Privacy and Acceptable Use policies.</div>

						<h2>Plans Service Agreement</h2>
						<div>
							<p>Plans are subscriptions purely designed for residential usage.<br><br>
If you subscribe to one of our plans we will provide the Service solely to you for normal residential, non-commercial use. You and only those of your immediate family members who reside in your personal residence can use the Service. National Plans are provided primarily for continuous live dialog between two individuals. Unusual call patterns, excessive conferencing or call forwarding, excessive numbers and/or consistent excessive usage will be considered indicators of non-residential use. Any other indicators of impermissible usage may trigger an account review or further action by us.<br>Any Tello user can have at any given moment a maximum of 10 lines in their online account. <br><br>


	By subscribing to Tello plans you agree to be charged monthly. To cancel the subscription you must deactivate the Service from your account. Regardless of the number of minutes, data used you will be charged monthly for your subscription. The monthly fee is non-refundable.<br><br>
        Calls are charged with minute rounding. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next full minute.
<br>
Minutes included in a plan are available for US, Canada, Mexico and China. Any call made to a number from these countries will be charged from the Customer's plan balance. <br>

<br>
	Plans rates are subject to change without any prior notice.<br><br> 
	Plans will be automatically renewed every 30 days, unless a Customer decides to change or renew a plan during the billing cycle, which is possible. The Customer will be charged on the spot, which initiates a new billing cycle.<br>
If the automatic billing fails, a new attempt will take place on the next day (on the 31st day of your plan). If the billing succeeds, your billing date will remain the same as before. If automatic billing fails to pay the charges on your account in full on
the second attempt, your Services may be suspended or terminated, at Telloâs sole
discretion and your plan may be deleted.<br><br>

If a plan is changed or renewed during the billing cycle, any remaining balance will roll over for the next 30 daysâ¨ (except for unlimited plans if available). The billing date will also be renewed each time Customer changes a monthly plan.<br><br>
     

	Any unused balance of the plan will expire once the usage period is over. <br><br>
     Any change made during the billing period is effective immediately after the request has been processed by the system. <br><br>

The Service can be canceled at any time from the account. Once the subscription is canceled you will no longer be charged. <br><br>

Tello reserves the right to expire numbers that no longer have an active plan. Customers will receive a notification via SMS or email 7 days prior to the expiry. Your specific phone number will be reallocated to another Customer and will not be available after expiry.

<br><br>
<strong>Tello, LLC Service plans which include a data plan (âData Planâ) as part of the Service</strong><br> Data usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session. Your data usage includes, among other things, text, web browsing, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited. We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.  All data purchased through a Tello, LLC Service plan (both data that comes with a particular Tello, LLC Service plan and any additional data you purchase as an add-on), will expire immediately upon termination of your Tello, LLC Service plan for any reason.</p>
							<p>If more than one product is active in customer's account, the balance will be used in this priority: for data usage, national calls and texts: Plans balance and then Pay As You Go balance.
Premium destinations can not be called with any of our plans. These numbers can be called with Pay As You Go balance.</p>
							<p><strong>Tello Unlimited Plan</strong><br>
The Unlimited Plan is meant for using data mainly with your mobile phone. We reserve the right to limit excessive tethering/hotspot usage above 5GB. Accounts where we find excessive data usage may experience slowness in speed and/or service limitations for the current billing cycle, up to termination.<strong>The Unlimited Data Plans are not available for renewal. </strong><br><br>
New and existing customers on qualifying plans including data have streaming video optimization technology automatically applied to our plans, and video is delivered at a lower resolution (typically 480p) rather than at a higher resolution which is better suited for larger screens. This helps customers stretch their Data Plans by reducing the amount of high-speed data consumed for streaming video. Data speed optimization is not applied when a device is on Wi-Fi and therefore all data, including video, will be delivered at available speeds.</p>

						<h2>Taxes, Surcharges & Fees
</h2>
						<div><strong>Sales on tello.com</strong><br>
In addition to the charges billed for Tello Services, surcharges, taxes, fees, and other charges may be applied to your invoice based on the type of service you have, and your geographical location, among other factors.<br>
By visiting and shopping on this site, the Customer agrees to pay all applicable federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges or fees required or permitted to be billed by Tello. Additionally, the Customer acknowledges that
international services may be subject to value-added taxes or other taxes or fees
imposed by the countries in which calls originate or terminate. The Customer is responsible
for, and agrees to pay, all such taxes and fees imposed upon the Customerâs use of the
Services. <br><br>


Certain taxes, fees or surcharges may show up as separate line items on your invoice. Examples include, but are not limited to the following.  <br><br>
 
<h2>Federal Surcharges </h2><br><br>
<strong>Federal Universal Service Fund ("FUSF"). </strong>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires Tello to contribute to the Federal Universal Service Fund ("FUSF"). The FUSF helps to make phone service affordable and available to all Americans, including: <br>
<ul>
<li>consumers with low incomes; </li>
<li>those living in areas where the cost of providing telephone service is high; </li>
<li>public schools and libraries; </li>
<li>rural healthcare providers.</li> 
</ul>
<br><br>
 
The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") delegates the administration of the FUSF to the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC").  Each quarter, the FCC adopts a "contribution factor" for FUSF support.  The contribution factor is a percentage of the total interstate and international end-user telecommunications and Interconnected VoIP ("I-VoIP") revenue that each carrier is responsible for contributing to the FUSF.  <br><br>
 
As permitted by FCC regulations, Tello has opted to bill the FUSF surcharge as a separate line item to end-user Customers. Consistent with such regulations, Tello only bills FUSF line-item charges in an amount equal to the quarterly contribution factor currently in effect multiplied by the invoiced amount subject to the FUSF.  This is a permissible pass-through surcharge but is not a tax or charge mandated by the government.<br><br>
Please visit <a href="http://www.usac.org/default.aspx">USAC's website</a> for more information on the FUSF.<br><br>
 
<h2>State & Local Regulatory Surcharges</h2><br><br>
 
<strong>State Universal Service Fund (USF).</strong> Tello may also be required to contribute to State Universal Service Funds ("SUSF"). The funds may be used to assist in providing universal service and to support a variety of other programs at the state level. Tello collects applicable charges from its end-user Customers.  These charges are permissible pass-through surcharges but are not taxes or charges mandated by the government.<br><br>
<strong>Telecommunications Relay Services Fund.</strong> Some states also require contributions to State Telecommunications Relay Services ("TRS") Funds to offset the cost of providing local transmission services that provide hearing or speech challenged individuals with the ability to use certain communications services.  Many states require Tello to remit this fee to the governing authority.  Tello collects applicable fees from Customers and remits them to the relevant authorities.  
<br><br>
 
<h2>State & Local Sales and Use Tax</h2><br><br>
All states, with few exceptions, impose some form of state-level sales and use tax. The sales and use tax is generally imposed on the sale or use of tangible personal property and certain services.  These taxes are intended to be passed on to the end user/consumer.  <br><br>
 
In many states, local jurisdictions also impose a sales or use tax. In some instances, the local sales and use tax is administered by the local jurisdiction.  In other instances, the state administers the local sales and use tax.
Certain exemptions apply to sales for resale, and sales to certain types of entities (e.g., the federal government, state and local governments, non-profit entities, etc.).  <br><br>
 
 
Tello collects sales and/or use taxes as required by state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
<strong>Communications Services Tax</strong><br><br>
 
Some state and local jurisdictions impose communications specific taxes on communications services in addition to or in lieu of sales or use tax.  The communications services tax is intended to be passed on to the end user/consumer.  The rate for communications services tax (CSR) is usually different than Sales and Use Tax Rate and its value varies by jurisdiction.<br><br>
Certain exemptions apply for sales for resale, and sales to certain types of entities (e.g., the federal government, state and local governments, non-profit entities, etc.).  <br><br>
 
 
Tello collects the communications services tax as required by applicable state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
<strong>Gross Receipts Taxes</strong><br><br>
 
A number of states impose a gross receipts tax on communications service providers.  In some states, gross receipts tax is intended to be passed on to the end user/consumer.  In other states, the gross receipts tax is the responsibility of the seller, and there is no pass-through to the end user.<br><br>
 
Certain exemptions may exist. Gross receipts tax is intended to be passed on to the Customer, based on the type of entity making the purchase (e.g., the federal government, state and local governments, non-profit entities, etc.).  <br><br>
 
 
Tello pays gross receipts taxes, and collects them from Customers when required (or permitted) by applicable state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
<strong>Local Utility Taxes</strong><br><br>
 
Local utility taxes are imposed by cities and counties in a select number of states.  Certain exemptions apply to sales for resale, and sales to certain types of entities (e.g., the federal government, state and local governments, non-profit entities, etc.).  <br><br>
 
 
Tello pays local utility taxes, and collects them from customers when required (or permitted) by applicable state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
<strong>Local License Taxes</strong><br><br>
 
Local license taxes are imposed by cities and counties in a limited number of states. <br><br>
 
Certain exemptions apply to sales for resale, and sales to certain types of entities (e.g., the federal government, state and local governments, non-profit entities, etc.).  <br><br>
 
 
Tello pays local license taxes, and collects them from Customers when required (or permitted) by applicable state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
 
<strong>E911 Fees</strong><br><br>
 
In order to maintain adequate 911 funding provided to emergency telephone service, state and local jurisdictions impose E911 fees on certain communications services. These fees are sometimes administered by the state department of revenue, but the majority of E911 fees are assessed and administered by local jurisdictions.  E911 fees are intended to be passed on to the customer on the invoice. Sales for resale are generally exempt from E911 fees. Non-profit organizations are generally subject to E911 fees, whereas they might be exempt from taxes or other fees.<br><br>
 
Tello collects E911 fees from Customers when required by applicable state and/or local law.<br><br>
 
 
<h2><i>Other Fees</i></h2><br><br>
 
<strong>Cost Recovery</strong><br><br>
 
<strong>Cost Recovery Fee/Surcharge. </strong>A Cost Recovery Surcharge equal to 3% of total invoiced charges (excluding taxes) will apply to all Pay as You Go Customer invoices. A separate Cost Recovery Fee will apply to unlimited plan Customers.  <br><br>
 
This charge is imposed to recover costs incurred by Tello for fees, contributions and/or charges associated with one or more of the following: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>telecommunications services for the sight and hearing impaired</li>
<li>local number portability</li>
<li>North American Numbering Plan administration</li>
<li>and administrative costs, fees and expenditures related to compliance with Federal regulatory programs and annual FCC regulatory fee obligations, along with other carrier and administrative expenses (including, but not limited to, costs imposed upon Tello by its suppliers). </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
 
This is a permissible fee but is not a tax or charge mandated by the government.  For more information on programs supported by these surcharges, please see below.<br><br>
 
<i>Federal Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Fund. </i>The TRS Fund was established by the FCC in 1993 to reimburse TRS providers for the cost of providing interstate TRS services. TRS services are telephone transmission services that provide hearing or speech challenged individuals with the ability to use a traditional telephone.<br><br>
 
Under the FCCâs rules, Tello must contribute a percentage of its end-user communications revenues to the TRS Fund. The contribution percentage varies annually.<br><br>
 
<i>Local Number Portability Administration (LNPA). </i> Local Number Portability ("LNP") is a customerâs ability to keep existing phone numbers when switching to another service provider.  Tello must provide LNP, as well as contribute to the FCCâs LNPA program, designed to diffuse the costs of administering LNP.  Tello pays a proportionate share of the LNP costs in each region in which it operates and has customers. This fee varies frequently by region.  <br><br>
 
<i>North American Numbering Program Administration (NANPA).</i> The North American Numbering Plan ("NANP") is an integrated telephone numbering plan for the Public Switched Telephone Network ("PSTN") serving multiple countries including the United States and its territories. It is administered by the North American Numbering Plan Administration ("NANPA"). <br><br>
 
Under the FCCâs rules, Tello must contribute to the costs of numbering administration. Contributions are based on a percentage of Telloâs revenues from customers using international, intrastate and interstate communications services. The percentage varies annually.<br><br>

<strong>Applies to California Customers Only</strong><br>
On November 15, 2018, the <a href="https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/prepaid-mts-surcharge.htm">Prepaid MTS Surcharge Collection Act</a>, originally enacted in January 2016, was declared unenforceable by the United States District Court, as it conflicts with federal law.<br>

For clarification, the Prepaid MTS surcharge was made of 3 parts (mts 911, puc, and local). The components declared unenforceable include just the mts 911 and puc charges.<br>

As a courtesy to the customers, Tello, LLC refunded the collected MTS surcharges (mts 911 and puc) back to the customers in early 2019. The collection period which was refunded began on January 1st 2016 and ending on December 2018.<br>

After December 31 2018, Prepaid MTS surcharges (local) are still being charged. <a href="https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/mts.htm">The rates are listed here.</a></div>

					<h2>Refund and payment</h2>
					<div><strong>All charges billed by Tello exclude taxes.</strong>
Tello is committed to customer satisfaction and offers a 100% money back guarantee. An online purchase of anyÂ Tello product or serviceÂ requires
payment using a credit/debit card or PayPal account. Tello does not store credit/debit card
information. Tello will refund the amount for any unused product or service to any Customer who
is dissatisfied with Telloâs Services, subject to certain conditions. Refunds must be received by
Tello within several days of the purchase date. Any promotion or discount applied to an order
for which a refund is provided will be deducted from the amount of the refund.
Tello will not refund any taxes paid on orders older than 6 months.<br><br>
If an account and phone number are no longer active, any remaining balance (Pay As You Go
credit or any Plan balance) in that account will be forfeited. <br><br>

To request a payment refund, contact Tello Customer Service. You'll need to be the account
holder or an authorized user and able to verify your identity and account information.<br>
To request a refund via Chat or Email, send a message through our Contact section.
The customerÂ mustÂ be logged into his online account to send the request.
Payments older than 5 months from the date of request are not eligible for refunds.
In the event that your original payment method cannot accept the refund, an equivalent credit
will be added to your account in the form of Tello Dollars.<br>
Refund requests sent after a number port out will not be processed.<br>
Refund requests are typically evaluated within one business day, with refund determinations
sent via Email. <br><br>


<strong>Pay As You Go</strong> refunds are available for a period of 90 days from
Customer's last order. If no order was placed within 90 days of purchase, Pay As You Go credit
will expire.<br>


In response to a valid refund request, Tello will refund the total unused Pay as You Go account
balance as long as the balance is still active.Â Refunds are not available for Pay As You Go
balances purchased more than 5 months from the date of the request. In such case, a credit
will be added to your account in the form of Tello Dollars. Partial refunds may be issued for
unused Pay As You Go balances as decided on a case-by-case basis.
Tello will not refund any fees related to auto-recharges. This includes applicable data-related
charges. See <a href="/terms#paragraph_pay_as_you_go">https://tello.com/terms#paragraph_pay_as_you_go</a> for more information on Pay As You Go plans.<br><br>

						<h2>Phone Warranty
</h2>
						<div>All phones (new, open-box, refurbished or pre-owned) purchased from Tello have a 30 day warranty. If you need to check the warranty or return the phone, you'll need to contact our <a href="/contact">Customer Support</a> team. They will help you ship the phone back to the provider without any shipping costs.<br><br>

If your device is defective and it's eligible for a warranty replacement, we'll replace the defective device with a new or refurbished device of the same or comparable model from our available stock. The warranty we offer only covers defects in functionality, materials or workmanship. The warranty covers issues such as software-related problems, activation problems, camera defects, unresponsive keys, multiple dead pixels, etc.<br><br>

It does not cover defects arising from damage, normal wear-and-tear or liquid accidents. The warranty does not cover issues like diminishing battery life, scratches, damage from drops, accidental damage, coverage issues, or software incompatibility or problems with third-party apps. Attempting to 'root', open or fix your device will immediately void its warranty. Visible physical damage to your device will void its warranty.<br><br>

Phones purchased from Tello may also be covered by a manufacturerâs warranty. These third-party warranties vary from product to product. Warranties may be limited to pre-owned, refurbished, or open-box items. It is your responsibility to consult the applicable product documentation for specific warranty information. These warranties are separate from the limited Tello 30-day phone warranty. In addition, you acknowledge that certain third-party warranties may limit or void the remedies that they offer if unauthorized persons perform support service on the device.

Records are registered and saved for an undefined period of time; they are confidential and will be used only to determine statistics, general trends, or recurrent requests of the customers.

<strong>Accessibility features </strong><br>

											<div><br><strong>Hearing Aid Compatibility</strong><br>
All the phones offered by Tello are hearing aid compatible devices. Still, there are two different ratings to consider when picking a hearing aid compatible device: M-Ratings (reduced hearing aid device interference) and T-Ratings (compatibility with hearing aids with telecoils). <br>
M4 and T4 are  the better/higher of the 2 ratings for each one. The hearing aid compatibility ratings for the devices we offer are listed in the Tech Specs section of each device. Customers can verify the HAC rating of each phone being sold by Tello as follows: <br>
 - Go to the <a href="/phones">Phones page</a>.<br>
 - Click on "View Details" of the device in question. <br>
 - Scroll down to Tech Specs to see the HAC details. <br>
Customers are fully responsible for correctly using their hearing aid devices and for establishing the connection between the phone purchased and the hearing devices they own.<br><br>
<strong>Visual Aid Devices</strong><br>
There are a number of devices able to help Customers with vision disabilities. The options most commonly used on these devices are: Voice Command, Menu Readout, Voice Over or Voice Command. Customers can check the specifications of each phone for such features. <br>
Besides these, all iOS devices offer Siri, that can be used to send messages, place calls, etc.
The majority of Android devices offer TalkBack, SoundBack, and KickBack, free applications designed to increase the accessibility of Android devices. These applications can add spoken, audible, and vibration functionality to the device.<br><br>
<strong>Video Relay Service</strong><br>
The Video Relay Service (VRS) is intended to assist individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-impaired (D-HOH-SI) to communicate with hearing individuals via a sign language interpreter. 
VRS services work as a video call which offers the chance to the disabled individual to see a sign language interpreter. The interpreter can then communicate with the hearing individual.<br>

The use of the VRS services requires a data plan. If the maximum amount of 4G LTE/5G of the plan is used and data is throttled, then for all users that need to use the VRS service, we will remove the data throttling as long as the customer can provide proof of disability.<br><a href="/images/certification-of-disability-form.pdf" target="_blank">The Certificate of Disability is available here for download.</a><br><br>
