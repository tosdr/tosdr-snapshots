From time-to-time HugeDomains has features on its site that shows cart adds and favorite/saved domains. Even though HugeDomains prevents many bots from scraping its site, it is not provided with a guarantee that such data might not be affected by bot traffic.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>SALE OF DOMAIN NAMES</b></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Purchase.</b> All domain names listed on HugeDomains.com are listed by each domain's respective owner, and/or principals, and may be assumed &quot;for sale.&quot; In order to complete a purchase of a domain name through the Services you must submit the requisite payment amount as listed on the Services through any of HugeDomains' authorized payment providers. All fees are stated in United States Dollars and must be paid in United States Dollars. All fees due and payable under this Terms of Use are exclusive of taxes, which will be added at the prevailing rate from time to time. The price of any domain listed for sale through the Services is subject to change at any time without advance notice, prior to initiation of your purchase and/or transaction. Upon successful completion of the sales transaction and subject to final verification by HugeDomains, you will be the owner of the purchased domain name, which includes the exclusive right to use that domain name for as long as you keep the domain name registered and in good standing with a permitted registrar. No images, hosting, logos, web content, or any other rights of any kind associated with the purchased domain name will be transferred to you along with the domain name and part of the sale.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Platform Fee</b>. Certain domain names that are listed for sale on HugeDomains are sold under special contracts we have with the domain name's owner. Such domains will have a "platform fee" attached to them which is the commission that HugeDomains takes. This fee is only applicable to specific domain names and will be shown in the shopping cart when checking out. If you are checking out with multiple domains, the HugeDomains platform will charge the higher of two platform fees. In this case, we recommend you check out twice to minimize the platform fee that you will pay. If you have any questions about the platform fee please <a class="link blueLink" href="/contact.cfm">reach out to our support team</a>. If you are opting for a payment plan, the platform fee is split among all payments that are made for the domain.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b><br/></b></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Transfer and Registration.</b> Upon successful purchase and verification of such purchase, the domain name will be transferred to you at the current registrar. You may keep the purchased domain registered at its current registrar or, if permitted by law and/or registrar you may transfer the purchased domain to another registrar of your choosing. It will be your sole responsibility to ensure your domain is properly registered and that your registration is in good standing with the applicable registrar including the direct payment of annual renewal fees to the registrar. HugeDomains has no control over the registration fees for any domain name. You are responsible for researching the cost of any registration and renewal fees prior to purchase. Registration fees vary by registrar, are usually between $10 and $20 USD per year for a .com domain, and it will be your sole responsibility as the new owner of the domain to keep the registration current. </p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Verification of Sales.</b> All sales are subject to the final approval of HugeDomains, and we reserve the right to deny fulfillment of any order at any time and for any reason. In the event that HugeDomains decides to stop fulfillment of an order and payment has already been rendered by the buyer, we will issue a complete refund immediately. A domain name sale transaction is not complete until the order has been verified and approved by HugeDomains. All domain name sales are subject to a final review and verification to ensure that that the domain(s) subject to the sale are: a) actually available for purchase; and b) there is nothing that would restrict the sale of each domain. Only once the domain name has been transferred into the buyer's name and the buyer has received possession of the domain will a sale be considered final. In most cases access to the domain will be available within one to two hours of purchase, however access to domains purchased after business hours will be available within the next business day. A sales receipt or email confirmation does not render the transaction complete. If circumstances arise affecting HugeDomains' ability to completely deliver a domain to the purchaser, all charges will be refunded appropriately. In order to complete certain transactions, HugeDomains may require additional verification from the buyer such as a valid photo ID or other documentation. If the buyer fails to provide such additional information requested by HugeDomains , the order will be cancelled, and a refund will be issued. A sale will not be considered complete until the order has been both verified and approved by HugeDomains, and the domain has been successfully transferred to the buyer at the applicable registrar.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Payment.</b> HugeDomains uses a third-party payment platform to process payments. Your credit card information or other payment method will be processed and stored by our third-party Payment Processor and not stored on our servers. You expressly understand and agree that all payments and monetary transactions are handled by such third-party and the use of such platform is governed by the third-party's terms and conditions and HugeDomains shall have no liability related thereto. In the event you elect to pay the fees due hereunder via credit card, you authorize HugeDomains to charge the payment account for the fees due. If HugeDomains believes that a buyer has participated in a fraudulent chargeback, HugeDomains will pursue its claims against buyer to the fullest extent allowed by law. If for any reason HugeDomains is unable to charge your payment method for the full amount owed, or if we receive notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or are charged a penalty for any fee previously charged to your payment method, you agree that HugeDomains may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or purchased on your behalf.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>Payment Methods</b>. HugeDomains accepts the following payment methods: credit card, debit card, wire transfer, PayPal, and Escrow.com. HugeDomains does not accept payment via check under any circumstances. Any checks sent to HugeDomains will be destroyed without being processed, deposited or cashed.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>3rd Party Legal Rights.</b> HugeDomains is not responsible in determining whether the domain name(s) listed for sale infringe upon the legal rights of others. It is the buyer's sole responsibility to research whether the purchase and use of a domain will infringe upon the legal rights of other entities and individuals, including but not limited to trademark and/or copyright infringement. In the event you wish to submit a trademark infringement claim on a specific domain purchased, please submit such claim to our legal department (

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to certain conditions, HugeDomains offers a full refund for domain name sales in the event a buyer chooses to return a purchased domain within 30-days of purchase. In order to qualify for a refund the buyer must: a) have purchased the domain from the website hugedomains.com; b) have maintained the domain with the same registrar the domain was registered with at the time of purchase; c) transfer the domain, including exclusive control thereof, to HugeDomains within 30-days of the purchase date; and d) submit a refund request to HugeDomains within 30 days of purchase by email at

In addition to the foregoing requirements, in order to be eligible for a refund, the domain submitted for a refund cannot have been used since the date of purchase in any negative, illegal, or malicious manner, including but not limited to, being used for spam, phishing, defamation, adult website hosting, or anything that is determined to be reasonably problematic to the health and value of the domain. In the event HugeDomains determines in its sole and absolute discretion that a buyer's actions and use of the domain have caused harm to the health and value of the domain, that domain will not be eligible for return and refund. Any domains purchased through a third-party platform will not be eligible for a refund and the buyer will be bound by that third party's terms of sale. Additionally, payment plan purchases are not eligible for the 30-day return policy described herein and such purchases are subject to the specific terms of the applicable payment plan. In all reasonable cases HugeDomains will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor the return policy described herein. A buyer will be permitted only one domain return/refund per calendar year. Any refunds will be issued back to the buyer in the same manner as purchase.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>USE OUTSIDE DEFINED AREA</b></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><br/></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">Please be aware that our Services are subject to United States laws, including laws governing privacy and security of your information.
