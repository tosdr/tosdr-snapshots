<p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization.</p>
<h2>Copyright Policy</h2>

<p>VidLii has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that VidLii shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
