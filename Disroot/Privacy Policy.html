Federated services are those that interoperate with each other (exchanging information and services) regardless of the provider (e.g. email or open social networks). These services use protocols that necessarily share or transfer data between different providers and therefore such interactions are outside the scope of this Privacy Statement.<br><br />
It is important to note that <strong>sharing data with other services providers is a user’s choice</strong> (see <a href="#data_we_collect">1. What data do we collect?</a>) and is configured by the users in their services settings, including the decision what to share and with whom.</p>

<br></p>
<h1>1. What data do we collect?</h1>
<p>If a user chooses to use any of the services provided by us, the following data will be required and therefore collected by <strong>Disroot.org</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A valid email address: required for account creation. This email address is deleted from our database after the account has been approved/denied, unless the user chooses during the registration process, to keep it for password reset process.</li>
<li>An username and a password: required to identify the account holder and provide the services offered by <strong>Disroot.org</strong>.</li>
<li>Necessary information related to the operation and functioning of the services which may include, for example, IP address, User Agent, etc. <em>More detailed information about this and how we handle it can be found in the <a href="#per_services">Privacy notices per service</a>.</em></li>
<li>When a user makes an online donation to <strong>Disroot.org</strong>, we collect personal data such as, but not limited to, username (if any), country (in case of extra storage request for tax purposes), transaction IDs or bank account/reference. The purpose for which we use this data is merely administrative (verification of regular donations, accounting management) and is maintained under the same security measures described in the "<a href="#how_we_store">How do we store your data?</a>" section. Since all the data we collect is previously processed by a third-party payment processor such as PayPal, Patreon or Liberapay, by using these or similar services, their use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, not ours, so we encourage you to review those policies carefully.</li>
<li>Any additional information that the user chooses to supply while using the services provided by us (whether it is chats, posts, emails, etc.). This additional information is optional and with the user's consent.</li>
</ul>

<br></p>
<h2>1.2. How do we store your data?</h2>
<p>To protect your data we use the following security measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use disk encryption on all servers to prevent data leak in case the servers are stolen, confiscated or in any way physically tampered with.</li>
<li>We provide and require SSL/TLS encryption on all "user-to-server" and "server-to-server" communications on all provided services.</li>
<li>We utilize "end-to-end" and/or "server-side" encryption technologies whenever it is made available by services that allow it to provide maximum security for the users.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="how_we_backup"></a><br />
<br></p>
<h2>1.3. How do we backup your data?</h2>
<p>In order to allow attempt at recovery from data loss disaster situations, we create backups on remote server owned by Stichting Disroot.org. We backup data on daily basis and store them for period of 4 days.</p>
<p><a name="what_we_do_not"></a><br />
<br></p>
<h1>2. What we do not do with your data</h1>
<ul>
<li>We do not collect any other data than what is needed to provide you the service.</li>
<li>We do not, in any way, process, analyze your behavior or personal characteristics to create profiles about you or your usage of the services. We have no advertisements or business relationships with advertisers.</li>
<li>We do not sell your data to any third party.</li>
<li>We do not share your data to any third party unless in case of federated services which requires certain data to be shared in order to operate (e.g. other email service provider needs to know your email address to be able to deliver emails).</li>
<li>We do not require any additional information that is not crucial for the operation of the service (we do not ask for phone numbers, private personal data, home address).</li>
<li>We do not read/look nor process your personal data, emails, files, etc., stored on our servers unless needed for providing the service, troubleshooting purposes or under suspicion of breaking our <strong>Terms Of Services</strong> in which case we ask for prior permission from you or inform you afterwards of all actions taken against the account in the transparency report addressed to account holder.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="where_store"></a><br />
<br></p>
<h1>3. Where the data is stored?</h1>
<p>We store all data in <strong>our own servers</strong>, located in a data center in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="per_service"></a><br />
<br></p>
<h1>4. Detailed privacy notices per service</h1>
<p><a name="email"></a><br />
<br></p>
<h2>4.1. - <strong>Disroot Email</strong> (<a href="https://webmail.disroot.org">https://webmail.disroot.org</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>This service requires login with <strong>Disroot</strong> credentials.</li>
<li>All emails, unless encrypted by the user (with GnuPG/PGP, for example) are stored unencrypted on our servers.</li>
<li>IP addresses of currently logged in users via IMAP/POP3 protocols are stored as long as the device is logged in the server <em>(per each device logged in)</em>.</li>
<li>Server logs, which store information such as, but not limited to, your username and your IP address, <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> email addresses, IP addresses of servers the emails come in or go out to, are stored for a period of 24 hours after which they are deleted from the server. No backup of log files is created. Logs are kept to prevent brute-force attacks on accounts and to provide quick insight when debugging issues.</li>
<li>Given that email works on a <strong>federated</strong> protocol, when interacting with email addresses hosted on third party servers (e.g. Gmail.com, Posteo.org), data is sent to other independently operated and owned servers in the network over which we have no control.</li>
</ul>

<br></p>
<h2>4.2. - <strong>Disroot Cloud</strong> (<a href="https://cloud.disroot.org">https://cloud.disroot.org</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>This service requires login with <strong>Disroot</strong> credentials.</li>
<li>All files sent to the cloud are encrypted with a key-pair created based on the user password to add an extra level of security. Note, however, that the keys are stored on the server, which compromises the level of security to some degree (e.g.: if an attacker knows your password and obtain the encryption key-pair, can decrypt the data). However, <strong>no</strong> "Master Key" does exist on our setup, which means the Admins cannot decrypt any file stored on the cloud without knowing user's password prior.</li>
<li>Excluding the files, everything else (calendars, contacts, news, tasks, bookmarks, etc.) is stored unencrypted in a database, unless an application provides external encryption (none so far). This is a limitation of the software we are utilizing for this service (Nextcloud).</li>
<li>Server logs, which store information such as, but not limited to, your IP address, your username, an app currently used, error messages and User Agent, are stored for a period of 24 hours after which they are deleted from the server. No backup of log files is created. Logs are kept to prevent brute-force attacks on accounts and to provide quick insight when debugging issues.</li>

<li>Chat history is stored on the server in the same form as on the chat itself, meaning unencrypted chat is stored in plain-text and encrypted chat is stored encrypted. Additionally, the chat history, if not specified by the user on per chatroom basis, is stored on the server for a period of 1 month. You can decide to not have any history stored on the server per chat.</li>
<li>Server logs, which store information such as, but not limited to, your IP address and your username are stored for a period of 24 hours after which they are deleted from the server. No backup of log files is created. Logs are kept to prevent brute-force attacks on accounts and to provide quick insight when debugging issues.</li>
<li>Given that XMPP is a <strong>federated</strong> protocol, when interacting with users or chat-rooms hosted on third party servers, data is sent to other independently operated and owned servers in the network over which we have no control.</li>
<li>Files uploaded to the server are stored as is (plain-text or encrypted) for a period of 1 month.</li>
<li>If using <a href="https://webchat.disroot.org">Movim</a>, all the articles and comments published by you on our services are stored on the server.
