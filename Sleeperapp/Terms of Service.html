The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/</a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this section enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable JAMS Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>11.7      To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this section, within thirty (30) days of using our Services, you must notify Sleeper in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions.
