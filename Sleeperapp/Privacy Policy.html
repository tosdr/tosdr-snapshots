This is for the purposes of determining whether an on-line platform is a very large on-line platform (&quot;<b>VLOP</b>&quot;), reaching an average of at least 45 million users per month in the EU (i.e., representing 10% of the EU population). VLOPs are subject to additional requirements due to the role they play in the dissemination of content throughout the EU. Article 24(2) and other provisions of the DSA provide guidance for on-line platforms in calculating the number of average monthly active recipients of the service, including limiting this number to recipients located in the EU, excluding visits from automated bots and scrapers, and counting only unique visits, i.e., counting multiple visits by the same user to different sites or interfaces of the same platform only once in each month. We have calculated the average monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU based on the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024, in accordance with Recital 77 of the DSA. Our conclusion is that during this period the average number of monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU was below the 45 million users threshold for being designated as a VLOP. We will continue to monitor the number of average monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU and will publish updated information in accordance with Article 24(2). </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>Note that Blitz Studios, Inc. is the controller of personal data collected through the Services.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>8.     <b>Canada (PIPEDA)</b></p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>If you are a user in Canada, you are afforded specific rights regarding your information.

Article 24(2) and other provisions of the DSA provide guidance for on-line platforms in calculating the number of average monthly active recipients of the service, including limiting this number to recipients located in the EU, excluding visits from automated bots and scrapers, and counting only unique visits, i.e., counting multiple visits by the same user to different sites or interfaces of the same platform only once in each month. We have calculated the average monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU based on the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024, in accordance with Recital 77 of the DSA. Our conclusion is that during this period the average number of monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU was below the 45 million users threshold for being designated as a VLOP.
