This is the case especially then when data processing is required in order for us to be able to provide our contractual and online services, or when required by law, we are in possession of the consent of the user, and when it is collected for the sake of our legally legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation and safety of our online product as per Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, in particular with regard to range measurement, the creation of profiles for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as the collection of access data and the use of the services of third-party providers).</p>

In order for you to have any meaningful progress in your gameplay, we need to be able to reliably differentiate you from other users of our website / app, which is why we ask you to register an account or to use our guest mode.

            <p class="level-4">Your display name, avatar, and certain elements of your progress are made public within our game platform (e.g. for in-game leaderboards, or to broadcast certain wins). You can change your display name and avatar at any time.</p>

            <p class="level-4">These invoices contain data on what item you purchased, how much you paid for the item and what method you used to pay us with. We do not store information that could be used to make a payment on your behalf, unless you have given us a separate explicit, specific permission for this to ease your payment process (by enabling QuickPay; contractual fulfillment; Article 6.1.b GDPR).</p>

            <p class="level-4">Due to the nature of this interest, we cannot offer you a means to opt-out of this processing, as this would undermine its purpose (and in some cases, an opt-out is technically impossible - e.g. we cannot exempt your IP address from processing by our network devices).</p>

        <p class="level-3"><strong>Your personal data within Crayon Games GmbH</strong>Your personal data is processed only by the people necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests, or to comply with our contractual or legal obligations.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Your personal data outside of Crayon Games GmbH</strong>We share your data only where it is legally permissible to do so, either when it's required to fulfil contracts you may have with us (Article 6.1.b GDPR) or on basis of legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f GDPR).</p>
        <p class="level-3">We share your personal data only if you have given us permission to do so, in aggregate or anonymised form (preventing the data from being linked to other data you may have supplied elsewhere), or with providers that are contractually obliged to treat your data with care.</p>
        <p class="level-3">We exchange data with providers in the following categories:</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Hosting and content distribution providers</strong>. These typically have no direct access to our systems, but provide network infrastructure that will necessarily process your IP address to deliver our assets.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Payment providers</strong>. When you make a payment through a payment provider, we will get invoice information from these providers. Any payment details needed to actually make a payment on your behalf is handled only by the payment providers, not by us.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Debt collection</strong>. When you revoke a payment you made, we may share the information available to us with debt collectors, so that they can get in touch with you on our behalf.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Email marketing service providers</strong>. We share your email address, display name, and localisation information, and whether or not you are currently subscribed to our newsletter with our email marketing service providers, so that they can send you relevant emails.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Single sign-on providers</strong>. These are only relevant if you're playing our games through their website / apps or explicitly choose single-sign on options, in which case our interaction with them enables you to sign into our game platform. Should you change your mind about using these, the providers usually offer a way to decouple your single-sign on account from our website / app (revoking our access to your metadata); for more information, please refer to the providers' documentation.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Business intelligence</strong>. We use providers to help us sift through own our tracking data.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Game developers</strong>. These create and maintain our casino games for us. As these applications are typically standalone and can simply be embedded in our website / app "plug-and-play" style, we share only very little information about you with these providers - your IP address, device information, display name and the amount of in-game currency you own.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Crash reporting</strong>. Our mobile games embed crash reporting functionality. The crash reports contain only anonymous information. Nonetheless, you can opt-out of this in the settings of the application.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Affiliates, CoBrands and Performance Marketing</strong>. To allow brands, partners and campaigns to measure their own effectiveness, we embed various trackers on our website / app. For details, please refer to the <a href="http://Crayon Games-gmbh.net/privacy.html#web-and-app-analytics">Web and App Analytics</a> section of this privacy policy.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Address verification</strong>. Before we send out prizes to a physical address, we first ensure that the address is correct by letting it be processed by an address verification service.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Geolocation</strong>. We receive data about the approximate geographical location of IP addresses from geolocation services. (We do not share any information with these services, we are only consumers of this data.)</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Support ticket system</strong>. We use an external provider to handle our support ticketing for us. Any support ticket you write us through official channels will be stored with this provider.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Video streaming</strong>. In some cases, we use video streaming services to show you advertisements. Your impression of these videos is recorded by these services.</p>
        <p class="level-3">The providers we use are either in the European Union, in a country formally deemed safe by the data privacy standards of the European Union, or contractually bound to treat your data with the utmost care. Whenever the process allows, we anonymise or pseudonymise your data.</p>
        <p class="level-3"><strong>Under no circumstances do we sell your data to third parties.</strong></p>

    <p class="level-2">To improve our website / app and apps, to correct errors, to optimise the site and our campaigns used to promote it, we store pseudonymised data about our visitors' behaviour on our website / app and use several tracking services to assist us (on basis of Article 6.1.f GDPR).</p>
    <p class="level-2">These services either use cookies (desktop) or device IDs (mobile) to allow them to correlate the behavioural data they collect (for example to tell us how long the average user spent on our site, or how great a percentage of users that visited our site registered an account with us).</p>
    <p class="level-2">Data exchanged may be information on when you registered an account with us, from where you came (which banner you clicked or which game site you play our games on), your device parameters (e.g. operating system, brand), your user ID in our games, page impressions (time and page identifier) or payments you make.</p>
    <p class="level-2">The trackers use these data either to craft approximate behavioural profiles of you (enabling them to supply better marketing targeting to the users of their service), or to permit us to pay our campaigns by registration events or paying users rather than impressions ("performance marketing").</p>

        <p class="level-3"><strong>For mobile</strong>, for tracking to end-points controlled by us, please refer to the settings in the application itself. We use Firebase Crashlytics (a Google product) for error reporting and GameAnalytics für UserAnalytics; you can use the settings to opt-out of the error reporting and UserAnalytics functionality as well.</p>
        <p class="level-3">Since you may also interact with the other trackers that we use on other people's website / apps, opting out of the trackers on a single website / app will probably not do what you intended. To better enable you to opt-out of the tracking services effectively, this section contains an overview of all trackers we use and where you can opt-out of them.</p>
        <p class="level-3">The opt-out options of many tracking services can also be found on <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a>, which provides a unified and central opportunity for you to opt-out of various tracking services. That site can also help you if you want to review your online choices for other providers not used by us.</p>
        <p class="level-3">Unless otherwise noted (be it here or on our tracking partners' opt-out pages), your browser will need to accept cookies for the opt-out process to work.</p>
