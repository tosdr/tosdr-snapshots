<h5 class="my-2 text-lg font-semibold" id="governing-law--jurisdiction">Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h5>
<p class="pb-4">These Terms of Service shall be governed in all respects by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section &quot;Dispute Resolution,&quot; the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Mix are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you and Mix each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
<hr class="mb-8 mt-4"/>
<h5 class="my-2 text-lg font-semibold" id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h5>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, &quot;<strong class="font-semibold">Disputes</strong>&quot;) will be resolved <strong class="font-semibold">solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>. You and Mix agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Mix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. </p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Exceptions</u>. As limited exceptions to Section &quot;<u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>&quot; above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. </p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong class="font-semibold">AAA</strong>&quot;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &quot;<strong class="font-semibold">AAA Rules</strong>&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a class="font-medium text-accent" href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a class="font-medium text-accent" href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">www.adr.org</a>. </p>
<p class="pb-4">Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won&#x27;t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we&#x27;ll pay all of our attorneys&#x27; fees and costs and won&#x27;t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in Section &quot;<u>Exceptions</u>&quot; above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#x27;s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Class Action Waiver</u>. <strong class="font-semibold">YOU AND MIX</strong> <strong class="font-semibold">AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, if the parties&#x27; Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person&#x27;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
<p class="pb-4"><u>Severability</u>. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section &quot;<u>Class Action Waiver</u>,&quot; if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p>
<hr class="mb-8 mt-4"/>
<h5 class="my-2 text-lg font-semibold" id="other-provisions">Other Provisions</h5>
<p class="pb-4">These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Mix with respect your use of the Services and supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements, written or oral, including any prior versions of the Terms of Service. These Terms of Service do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights on any person or entity. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Mix. The provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature are continuing will survive any termination.</p>
