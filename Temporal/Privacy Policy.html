<p>This Global Privacy Policy describes how Temporal Technologies Inc. (hereinafter “Temporal”, “we,” “us,” and “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects the personal information of our customers (“Customers”), potential customers and visitors (“you” or “your”). Below, we also provide you with information about the rights and choices you may have with respect to your personal information, and how you can reach us to get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices in relation to the collection, processing, and storage of your personal information. By accessing or using our Services (defined below), you understand that we will process your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with or are not comfortable with any aspect of this Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Services. </p>
<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time which will be indicated by changing the date at the top of this page. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) through a notice on our Services before the change becomes effective or as otherwise required by law. We may provide “just-in-time” disclosures or additional information about our data collection, use, and sharing practices of specific services. These notices may supplement or clarify our privacy practices or may provide you with additional choices about how we process your personal information.  We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about our collection, processing, and sharing of your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>1. SCOPE – WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</strong></p>
<p>Temporal is committed to protecting the personal information of individuals who interact with us. This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we collect and use for our own purposes (i.e., as a “data controller”) during any written, electronic, audio visual recordings, audio transcripts, or oral communication or collected online or offline when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use, access, communicate with, or otherwise interact with our website located at temporal.io and all corresponding webpages or software applications that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Website”);</li>

<li>You visit our branded social media pages, visit our offices, receive communication from us, register or attend our events, programs, or webinars, or ask questions about our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Website may include links to websites and/or applications operated and maintained by third parties. Please note that we have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
<p>In providing our Services, we may process certain personal information on behalf of our Customers (as defined in terms of Service) as a “data processor.” In such cases, our Customers act as data controllers. Such Customers are solely responsible for establishing privacy policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, agreements, or other obligations relating to the processing of personal information of individuals who use the Customer’s instance of our Services. If you are an individual who uses a Customer’s instance of our Services, then except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, the processing of your personal information will be subject to the Customer’s privacy practices, and you should contact that Customer for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is typically data that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. This includes information you provide to us, information which is collected about you automatically, and information we obtain from third parties. The definition of personal information depends on the applicable law based on your physical location.
