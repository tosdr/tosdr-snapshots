                <p>This agreement applies to the order form to which these Terms and Conditions of Service are attached
                    (collectively, the “Agreement”). This Agreement is made by and between Securly, Ltd. (“Company”), a
                    Delaware corporation with offices at Third Floor One London Square, Cross Lanes, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom, GU1 1UN and its customer listed on the
                    order (“Customer”). The effective date of the Agreement is referred to herein as the “Effective
                    Date.”</p>

                <h2>1. Services</h2>

                <p>Company will provide to Customer the cloud-based software products and services identified in the
                    purchase order (the “Order”) that incorporates these terms and conditions (collectively, the
                    “Services” and, each, a “Service”). If there is a conflict or ambiguity between any term of this
                    Agreement and the Order, the terms and conditions of the Order shall control. The Services may
                    include, without limitation, Company’s cloud-based web filtering, online activity monitoring for
                    cyberbullying, auditing software, mobile device management software, tablet, and other computer
                    asset location tracking software, device control software for teacher classroom management, and any
                    other software or services offered by Company, including all updates thereto and related
                    documentation. Company shall provide all necessary user identifications and passwords for the
                    Services for use by Customer’s employees, agents, independent contractors, students and
                    parents/guardians (“Users”).</p>

                <h2>2. Security</h2>

                <p>Company represents and covenants that it maintains appropriate administrative, technical and physical
                    security measures to protect Customer data and personal information, including User Data (as defined
                    in Section 4 below), to the extent reasonably necessary for the performance of the Services
                    consistent with the Data Protection Addendum and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <h2>3. Support Services</h2>

                <p>Company shall provide Customer with support services as specified in the Order (the “Support
                    Services”). </p>

                <h2>4. Ownership</h2>

                <p>(a) Ownership of the Service; Intellectual Property. Company shall retain all title to and ownership
                    of and all proprietary rights with respect to the Services (including all software used to provide
                    the Services and all portions thereof (including all derivatives or improvements thereof)), whether
                    or not incorporated into or used with other software as a service, software or hardware. Customer’s
                    use of the Services does not constitute a sale of any of such software or any portion thereof.
                    Company’s name, logo, and the product names associated with the Services are trademarks of Company
                    or third parties, and no right or licence is granted herein to use them. Company hereby grants
                    Customer, solely during the term of this Agreement, a limited, royalty-free, revocable licence to
                    use and install the Company provided software (which may include certificates and pack files) solely
                    on Customer’s machines and devices and only as necessary or appropriate to receive the Services (the
                    “Client Software”).</p>

                <p>(b) Ownership of User Data. The Services may allow Customer to track and gather a range of data and
                    information regarding its Users (“User Data”). Customer shall retain all title to and ownership of
                    and all proprietary rights with respect to User Data and shall be solely responsible for its use
                    thereof. Customer is also responsible for securing and backing up its User Data and Company shall
                    only restore lost User Data to its last-backup point if the loss was due to a fault in Company’s
                    Services or Support Services. Customer hereby grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and
                    non-exclusive licence to access and use User Data for the sole purpose of enabling Company to
                    provide the Services, and for the limited purposes set forth in the Data Protection section and Data
                    Protection Addendum set out below.</p>

                <p>(c) Ownership of Reports and Analyses. Company may provide Customer with certain reports and analyses
                    as part of the Services (“Reports”). Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all
                    proprietary rights with respect to such Reports. Company hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive,
                    non-sublicensable, and non-transferable licence, for the term of this Agreement, to use Reports
                    strictly for Customer’s own internal, legitimate, non-commercial, educational purposes.</p>

                <p>(d) Mobile App and Parent/Guardian Usage. Customer acknowledges that Users may need to download the
                    Company’s mobile application from the relevant major mobile device provider app stores (iTunes or
                    Google Play) and that use of the Company’s mobile application or website by parents/guardians is
                    subject to Company’s terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

                <p>(e) Feedback. If Customer provides any ideas, suggestions or recommendations to Company regarding
                    Company’s software, products, services or technology (“Feedback”), such Feedback is provided on a
                    non-confidential basis to Company and Company is free to retain, disclose, use and incorporate such
                    Feedback in Company’s and/or its affiliates’ products and services, without payment of royalties or
                    other consideration to Customer. Customer understands and agrees that Company is not obligated to
                    use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such Feedback, and that it has no right to compel such
                    use, display, reproduction, or distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an
                    obligation on Customer to provide Feedback to Company.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>

                <p>Customer Personal Data (as defined within the Data Protection Addendum) shall be processed in
                    accordance with the terms set forth in the Data Protection Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit A.
                    For the purposes of Annex 2 (Standard Contractual Clauses) to Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum),
                    Customer is the “data exporter” and Securly is the “data importer” and by executing these terms and
                    conditions, both parties shall be deemed to have signed and executed Annex 2 (Standard Contractual
                    Clauses) to Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum) in all relevant places. For the avoidance of doubt,
                    in the event of inconsistencies between the provisions of the Data Protection Addendum and any other
                    agreements between the parties, including this Agreement, the provisions of the Data Protection
                    Addendum shall prevail.</p>

                <p>(a) The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider
                    to Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of
                    children under the legal age of adulthood (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the
                    authorization of Customer, in order to provide the Services requested by Customer.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer expressly agrees that data relating to the Services that does not identify and cannot be
                    used to identify any minor customer or any individual (“Aggregate Data”) is not Data or minor User
                    Data and Securly may maintain and use such data for its own purposes as set forth in the Privacy
                    Policy, provided it has implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent the re-identification of
                    Aggregate Data.</p>

                <h2>6. Customer Responsibilities, Warranties and Restrictions</h2>

                <p>(a) Customer agrees that it shall not do any of the following: (i) modify, make derivative works of,
                    disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services (including any Client
                    Software), or in any way attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying ideas or
                    algorithms of any part of the Services (including any Client Software); (ii) access or use the
                    Services (including any Client Software) in order to build a similar or competitive product or
                    service or for the purposes of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Company;
                    (iii) except as expressly stated herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display,
                    post or transmit in any form or by any means any of the Services (including any Client Software);
                    (iv) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services (and Customer shall make commercially
                    reasonable endeavours to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing the Services (including
                    any Client Software)); or (v) exceed the permitted number of devices, active users or students,
                    teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, in each case as specified in an Order.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer shall not (i) access or attempt to access the administrative interface of the Services
                    by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Company in connection with the
                    Services, unless otherwise agreed in writing or (ii) intentionally engage in any activity that
                    interferes with or disrupts the Services (or any servers or networks that are connected to the
                    Services).</p>

                <p>(c) Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under Customers’ accounts for the Services by
                    its authorized users. Customer shall notify Company within a commercially reasonable time of any
                    unauthorized use of any user account or any unauthorized use of the Services. Customer may not
                    access the Company Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or provide incorrect
                    information for an Order for purposes of reducing amounts payable to Company.</p>

                <p>(d) Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Services only in
                    compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations.
                    Although Company has no obligation to monitor Customer’s use of the Services, Company may do so and
                    may prohibit any use of the Services it reasonably believes may be (or is alleged to be) in
                    violation of this Agreement or applicable laws and regulations. </p>

                <p>(e) Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Customer has taken all actions, complied
                    with all requirements, obtained all prior consents and reviews, and otherwise satisfied all
                    prerequisites that may be necessary or appropriate to enable Customer to enter into and perform this
                    Agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions; and (ii) the software for the Services
                    provided under this Agreement will be treated as “commercial computer software” and “commercial
                    computer software documentation” under any applicable laws, regulations or rules. </p>

                <p>(f) If Customer is a government entity, unit, agency, organization, entity or party (including a
                    school or school district), then Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that there is
                    no applicable law, regulation, rule, or other governmental requirement (A) which in any way
                    restricts or limits the duty of Customer to fully perform and comply with all obligations of
                    Customer as set forth in this Agreement, or (B) which impairs the rights of Company as set forth in
                    this Agreement. </p>

                <p>(g) If any software or documentation is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United
                    States Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer
                    software” or “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with
                    Company to the contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in
                    the case of civilian agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD
                    use, limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.</p>

                <h2>7. Confidential Information</h2>

                <p>(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one
                    party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the
                    course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices,
                    processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other
                    material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary
                    or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information
                    shall also include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems
                    architecture, including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code,
                    documentation, methods of processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists,
                    sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances;
                    (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered
                    and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall
                    not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2)
                    is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an
                    obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or
                    access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information. </p>

                <p>(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or
                    expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a
                    trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient
                    shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose
                    the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless
                    required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information
                    with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar
                    nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use
                    Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and
                    obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to
                    its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a
                    bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with
                    Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms
                    and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
                    7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and
                    organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful
                    destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a
                    level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the
                    Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the
                    limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                    governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in
                    advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with
                    copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its
                    Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient
                    shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
                    Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential
                    Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information
                    (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the
                    termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient
                    will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level
                    employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.</p>

                <p>(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and
                    conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be
                    difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any
                    Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief
                    (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon
                    an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and
                    the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the
                    Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason.
                    Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event
                    that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to
                    Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to
                    violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such
                    other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in
                    equity.</p>

                <h2>8. Billing and Payment</h2>

                <p>The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services by
                    Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may be charged based on
                    the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school or district, or
                    (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an Order.
                    Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order. The Fees
                    exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges (“Taxes”), and
                    Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s
                    income) and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as
                    well as government charges, and all reasonable expenses and legal fees Company incurs collecting
                    late amounts. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty
                    (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order or Customer is purchasing
                    the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that
                    Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer
                    prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer. Late payments
                    may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate permitted by
                    law, if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to
                    charges unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations
                    aside from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on
                    Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees
                    may only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If
                    Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller,
                    Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis
                    directly to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at
                    law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support
                    Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized
                    reseller on time, regardless of the reason.</p>

                <h2>9. Assignment</h2>

                <p>Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and interest in all or
                    any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written notice
                    thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”). The Notice of Assignment shall provide the name and contact
                    information for the Assignee and shall instruct Customer to make payment of the assigned Fees to the
                    Assignee. Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the acknowledgement
                    provision in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such Notice of
                    Assignment and (ii) Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees to the
                    Assignee, notwithstanding the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.</p>

                <h2>10. Term and Termination</h2>

                <p>(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
                    its terms and conditions, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or,
                    if no period is specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the
                    “Initial Term”). This Agreement will thereafter continue for successive twelve (12) month periods
                    (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at
                    least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term, together with all Renewal
                    Terms, are collectively referred to as the “Term”.</p>

                <p>(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the
                    occurrence of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of
                    Default” means a breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under
                    this Agreement, if such breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of
                    written notice from the other party.</p>

                <p>(c) Any and all provisions in this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to be performed after
                    the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such
                    termination or expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality,
                    ownership of materials, payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations
                    of liability, effects of termination, and governing law. </p>

                <h2>11. Company Warranties, Company Disclaimers, and Exclusive Remedies</h2>

                <p>(a) Company warrants to Customer that it will provide the Services in all material respects as
                    described in the applicable end user documentation, if any, and will provide such Services in a
                    professional manner and in accordance with generally accepted industry practices. If the Services
                    provided to Customer are not performed as warranted, Customer agrees that it must promptly provide a
                    written notice to Company that describes the deficiency in the Services. </p>

                <p>(b) Company does not guarantee that (a) the Services will be performed error-free or uninterrupted,
                    or that company will correct all errors, (b) the Services will operate in combination with
                    customer’s content or applications, or with any other hardware, software, systems, Services or data
                    not provided by company, and (c) the Services will meet customer’s or its users’ needs,
                    requirements, specifications, or expectations. Customer acknowledges that company does not control
                    the transfer of data over communications facilities, including the internet, and that the Services
                    may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such communications
                    facilities. Company is not responsible for any issues related to the performance, operation or
                    security of the Services that arise from Customer’s content or applications, or third party content
                    or Services, and disclaims all liabilities arising from or related to third party content or
                    Services. </p>

                <p>(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company does not guarantee
                    or warrant (a) that the Services will function to prevent minors from being exposed to
                    inappropriate, harmful, unsafe, or obscene content online, (b) that the Services will prevent or
                    otherwise discourage cyberbullying or self-harm by students, (c) that the Services will detect all
                    cyberbullying and self-harm by students, or (e) all social media sites, streaming media, web-based
                    email services, cloud storage sites, other internet sites (including porn, gambling and other
                    inappropriate sites for minors), direct messages and electronic documents and files will be blocked
                    or monitored.</p>

                <p>(d) For any breach of the Services warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy and Company’s entire
                    liability shall be the correction of the deficient Services that caused the breach of warranty, or,
                    if Company cannot substantially correct the deficiency in a commercially reasonable manner (as
                    determined solely by company in its reasonable discretion), then Customer may terminate the Services
                    and Company will refund to Customer the fees for the terminated Services that Customer pre-paid to
                    company for the period following the effective date of termination. In such an event, company shall
                    also exercise commercially reasonable endeavours to provide Customer with reasonable opportunity to
                    access the Services for the purposes of securing and backing up Customer’s User Data.</p>

                <p>(e) To the extent not prohibited by law, these warranties, terms and conditions are exclusive and
                    there are no other warranties, terms and conditions, and Company hereby disclaims and excludes all
                    other warranties, terms and conditions whether statutory, express or implied, including any implied
                    warranties, terms or conditions of satisfactory quality, non-infringement and fitness for a
                    particular purpose.</p>

                <p>(f) Use of Notify requires the use of a broadband or mobile data connection and a compatible device.
                    Company is not responsible for any disruption or failure of Notify due to delays, outages, or
                    disruptions in: (i) users’ data connection, (ii) mobile network operations, or (iii) the operation
                    of users’ devices. Using Notify on mobile devices may use voice or data allowances purchased from
                    mobile network operators. Using Notify out of the country may incur higher costs to users from their
                    mobile network operators.</p>

                <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                <p>(a) General Liabilities. Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party’s liability
                    for (i) tort of deceit; (ii) death or personal injury caused by its negligence; (iii) any breach of
                    the obligations implied by Section 12 Sale of Goods Act 1979 or Section 2 Supply of Goods and

                    THAT NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING
                    DAMAGES OR LOSSES (EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR
                    IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE): (I) LOSS OF
                    PROFITS; (II) LOSS OF DATA; (III) LOSS OF BUSINESS; (IV) LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS; (VI) LOSS OF

                    SECTION 10, IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ANY TYPE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED
                    THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND/OR DUE FROM CUSTOMER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY
                    PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON
                    CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. THIS
                    PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER’S VIOLATION OF COMPANY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
                    THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW ‎THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, OR OF
                    CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF ‎THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS OR ‎LIMITATIONS
                    DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL ‎RIGHTS.‎</p>

                <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>

                <p>(a) Customer Obligations. Customer shall defend Company against any claim, cause of action, suit or
                    proceeding (each a “Claim”) made or brought against Company by a third party arising out of or
                    attributable to Customer’s use of the Service (other than as expressly set forth in Section 12(b)
                    below), and shall indemnify Company for any settlements or damages finally awarded against, and for
                    reasonable legal fees incurred by, Company in connection with the Claim, on condition that Company
                    (a) promptly gives Customer written notice of the Claim; (b) gives Customer sole control of the
                    defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Customer may not settle any Claim unless the
                    settlement unconditionally release Company of all liability); and (c) provides reasonable assistance
                    in connection with the defense (at Customer’s reasonable expense).</p>

                <p>(b) Company Obligations. Company shall defend Customer against any Claim made or brought against
                    Customer by a third party alleging that Customer’s use of the Service infringes or misappropriates
                    the intellectual property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Customer for any damages
                    finally awarded against, and for reasonable legal fees incurred by, Customer in connection with the
                    Claim, on condition that Customer (a) promptly gives Company written notice of the Claim; (b) gives
                    Company sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Company may not
                    settle any Claim unless the settlement unconditionally release Customer of all liability); and (c)
                    provides reasonable assistance in connection with the defense (at Company’s reasonable expense). If
                    a Claim is brought or threatened, or Company believes is likely to occur, Company may, at its
                    option, (i) procure for Customer the right to use the Service, (ii) replace the Service with other
                    suitable products, or (iii) refund any prepaid fees that have not been earned and terminate this
                    Agreement upon notice. Company will have no liability under this Agreement or otherwise to the
                    extent a Claim is based upon (a) use of the Service in combination with software, hardware or
                    technology not provided by Company, if infringement would have been avoided in the absence of the
                    combination, (b) modifications to the Service not made by Company, if infringement would have been
                    avoided by the absence of the modifications, (c) use of any version other than a current release of
                    the Service, if infringement would have been avoided by use of a current release, or (d) any action
                    or omission of Customer for which Customer is obligated to indemnify Company under this Agreement.
                    This Section 12(b) states the Company’s sole liability to, and the Customer’s exclusive remedy
                    against, the Company for any type of intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

                <h2>14. Advertising and Public Announcements</h2>

                <p>Neither party will use the other party’s name or marks, refer to or identify the other party in any
                    advertising or publicity releases or promotional or marketing correspondence to others without such
                    other party’s written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may publish Customer’s name
                    as part of a publicly-available list of Company’s customers.</p>

                <h2>15. Relationship of the Parties</h2>

                <p>The parties are independent contractors with respect to each other, and nothing in this Agreement
                    shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, a partnership, fiduciary, or
                    agency relationship or any association or joint venture between the parties. Except as expressly
                    provided, a person who is not a party to this Agreement will not have any rights under applicable
                    law, including where applicable the Contacts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term
                    to this Agreement.</p>

                <h2>16. Force Majeure</h2>

                <p>Except payment obligations, any delay in or failure of performance by a party under this Agreement
                    will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent caused by any

                    term
                    may be as defined under applicable law) from or on behalf of Customer in connection with Company’s

                    use, display, reproduction, or distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an
                    obligation on Customer to provide Feedback to Company.</p>
                <h2>5. Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>(a) The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider
                    to
                    Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of children
                    under the age of 18 (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the authorization of
                    Customer, in order to provide the Services requested by Customer. Customer has received and reviewed
                    Company’s Privacy Policy, Children’s Privacy Policy and Notice of Privacy Practices (together the
                    “Privacy Policy”), which include a privacy policy and direct notice of privacy practices as required
                    by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule, 16 C.F.R. 313 (“COPPA”). Customer expressly
                    consents to the collection, use and disclosure of Minor User Data as set forth in the Privacy Policy
                    as applicable to those Services requested by Company. For the purposes of COPPA, Customer
                    acknowledges that it is an educational institution, that it plans to use the Services in its
                    capacity as an educational institution, and that it is authorized to consent to Company’s
                    collection, use and disclosure of Minor User Data by Company in order to provide the Services to
                    Customer. Customer further acknowledges, and Company agrees to provide, Customer an opportunity to
                    review the Minor User Data, and to request that such data be deleted and/or no longer collected or
                    used (which may impact the availability of the Services). By executing this Agreement, Customer
                    expressly acknowledges that it has received and reviewed the Privacy Policy, and grants its consent
                    to Company’s collection, use and disclosure of Minor User Data in accordance with the Privacy
                    Policy, which may be updated from time to time, provided Customer will be notified of any material
                    changes.</p>

                <p>(b) Notwithstanding Section 5(b), Customer expressly agrees that Company may de-identify or aggregate
                    User Data and Minor User Data so that it no longer identifies an individual under the age of 18
                    (“Aggregate Data”), and may maintain and use such data for its own purposes as set forth in the
                    Privacy Policy, provided it has implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent the re-identification
                    of Aggregate Data.</p>

                <p>(g) Where Customer’s use of the Services include visitor management, verification and tracking of
                    visitors and other individuals, and related services or applications (“VMS”): Customer represents,

                    disclosure of all information (including personal information) and its instructions to Securly
                    comply with applicable laws; (ii) that has provided (and will continue to provide) adequate notices
                    and has obtained (and will continue to obtain) the necessary permissions and consents from each

                    will not use the VMS (or any other of the Services) for the purposes of obtaining or conducting,
                    background checks, employment verification, hiring, promotion, retention, termination, or
                    reassignment decisions including but not limited to with respect to vendors, employees, contractors,

                    thereto (“FCRA”) or other state or federal laws or regulations related to consumer credit reports
                    and background checks.</p>

                <p>(h) There is no applicable law, regulation, rule, or other governmental requirement (A) which in any
                    way

                    Customer as set forth in this Agreement, or (B) which impairs the rights of Company as set forth in
                    this Agreement; and (iii) the software for the Services provided under this Agreement will be

                    States
                    Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or
                    “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with Company to
                    the contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in the case of
                    civilian agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD use, limited
                    by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.</p>

                <h2>7. Confidential Information</h2>

                <p>(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one
                    party
                    (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of
                    performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes,
                    documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or
                    information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which
                    otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also
                    include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture,
                    including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of
                    processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits,
                    organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the
                    Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered and
                    managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not
                    apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is
                    or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an
                    obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or
                    access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or
                    expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a
                    trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient
                    shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose
                    the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless
                    required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information
                    with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar
                    nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use
                    Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and
                    obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to
                    its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a
                    bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with
                    Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms
                    and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
                    7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and
                    organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful
                    destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a
                    level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the
                    Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the
                    limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                    governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in
                    advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with
                    copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its
                    Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient
                    shall
                    not acquire any rights or licenses therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
                    Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential
                    Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information
                    (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the
                    termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient
                    will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level
                    employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.</p>

                <p>(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms of
                    this
                    Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain.
                    Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by
                    Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post
                    bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the
                    Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to
                    the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an
                    adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the
                    foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has
                    reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information,
                    directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms of this
                    Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the
                    Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>
                <h2>8. Billing and Payment</h2>
                <p>(a) The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services
                    by
                    Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may be charged based on
                    the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school or district, or
                    (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an Order.
                    Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order. The Fees
                    exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges (“Taxes”), and
                    Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s
                    income) and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as
                    well as government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees Company incurs
                    collecting late amounts. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars
                    within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order or Customer
                    is purchasing the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have
                    agreed that Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by
                    the Customer prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by check or wire transfer.
                    Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law,
                    if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges
                    unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside
                    from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s
                    website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only
                    be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement.</p>

                <p>(b) Assignment. Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and
                    interest
                    in all or any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written
                    notice thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”). The Notice of Assignment shall provide the name and
                    contact information for the Assignee and shall instruct Customer to make payment of the assigned
                    Fees to the Assignee. Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the
                    acknowledgement provision in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such
                    Notice of Assignment and (ii) Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees
                    to the Assignee, notwithstanding the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.</p>

                <p>(c) If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized
                    reseller,
                    Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis
                    directly to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at
                    law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support
                    Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized
                    reseller on time, regardless of the reason.
                </p>
                <h2>9. Term and Termination</h2>
                <p>(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
                    its
                    terms and conditions, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or, if
                    no period is specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the “Initial

                    “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at least 30
                    days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term, together with all Renewal Terms,
                    are collectively referred to as the “Term”.</p>

                <p>(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the
                    occurrence of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of
                    Default” means a breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under
                    this Agreement, if such breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of
                    written notice from the other party.</p>

                <p>(c) Any and all provisions in this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to be performed after
                    the

                    or expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, ownership of
                    materials, payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of
                    liability, effects of termination, and governing law.</p>

                    PAID BY AND/OR DUE FROM CUSTOMER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT
                    GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
                    WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT
                    APPLY TO CUSTOMER’S VIOLATION OF COMPANY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

                <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>(a) Customer Obligations. Customer shall defend Company against any claim, cause of action, suit or
                    proceeding (each a “Claim”) made or brought against Company by a third party arising out of or
                    attributable to Customer’s use of the Service (other than as expressly set forth in Section 12(b)
                    below), and shall indemnify Company for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable
                    attorney’s fees incurred by, Company in connection with the Claim, on condition that Company (a)
                    promptly gives Customer written notice of the Claim; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense
                    and settlement of the Claim (provided that Customer may not settle any Claim unless the settlement
                    unconditionally release Company of all liability); and (c) provides reasonable assistance in
                    connection with the defense (at Customer’s reasonable expense).
                </p>
                <p>(b) Company Obligations. Company shall defend Customer against any Claim made or brought against
                    Customer by a third party alleging that Customer’s use of the Service infringes or misappropriates
                    the intellectual property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Customer for any damages
                    finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, Customer in connection with
                    the Claim, on condition that Customer (a) promptly gives Company written notice of the Claim; (b)
                    gives Company sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Company may not
                    settle any Claim unless the settlement unconditionally release Customer of all liability); and (c)
                    provides reasonable assistance in connection with the defense (at Company’s reasonable expense). If
                    a Claim is brought or threatened, or Company believes is likely to occur, Company may, at its
                    option, (i) procure for Customer the right to use the Service, (ii) replace the Service with other
                    suitable products, or (iii) refund any prepaid fees that have not been earned and terminate this
                    Agreement upon notice. Company will have no liability under this Agreement or otherwise to the
                    extent a Claim is based upon (a) use of the Service in combination with software, hardware or
                    technology not provided by Company, if infringement would have been avoided in the absence of the
                    combination, (b) modifications to the Service not made by Company, if infringement would have been
                    avoided by the absence of the modifications, (c) use of any version other than a current release of
                    the Service, if infringement would have been avoided by use of a current release, or (d) any action
                    or omission of Customer for which Customer is obligated to indemnify Company under this Agreement.
                    This Section 12(b) states the Company’s sole liability to, and the Customer’s exclusive remedy
                    against, the Company for any type of intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

                <p>Neither party will use the other party’s name or marks, refer to or identify the other party in any
                    advertising or publicity releases or promotional or marketing correspondence to others without such
                    other party’s written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may publish Customer’s name
                    as part of a publicly-available list of Company’s customers.</p>

                <h2>14. Relationship of the Parties</h2>

                <p>The parties are independent contractors with respect to each other, and
                    nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an employer- employee relationship, a
                    partnership, fiduciary, or agency relationship or any association or joint venture between the
                    parties.

                    occurrence beyond the reasonable control of such party, provided that the party affected by such
                    event will immediately notify the other party and begin or resume performance as soon as practicable
                    after the event has abated. If the act or condition beyond a party’s reasonable control that
                    prevents such party from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement continues for thirty
                    (30) days or more, then the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice
                    to the non-performing party. Without limitation, act or condition beyond Company’s reasonable
                    control include all acts and omissions of Company’s service providers. In the event of such
                    termination by Customer, Company shall refund to Customer such fees for the terminated services that
                    Customer pre-paid to Company for the period following the effective date of termination, and shall
                    also exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with reasonable opportunity to
                    access the Services for the purpose of retrieving User Data. In all other instances of delay or
                    failures on the part of Company under this Section 15 (i.e. wherein Customer does not or otherwise
                    cannot terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 15), Customer shall not be entitled to any
                    service credit or refund.</p>

                    permitted assigns of the foregoing. Customer may not assign, transfer or delegate its rights or

                    qualified subcontractors to perform any of the Services or Support Services, as provided herein. Any
                    attempted assignment, transfer or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.
                    This Agreement is intended for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties, is not intended to
                    benefit any third party, and only the parties may enforce this Agreement.</p>

                    (including any exhibit) must be in a writing that is signed by the parties hereto and expressly

                <p>(a) Ownership of the Service; Intellectual Property. Company shall retain all title to and ownership
                    of
                    and all proprietary rights with respect to the Services (including all software used to provide the

                    not incorporated into or used with other software as a service, software or hardware. Customer’s use
                    of the Services does not constitute a sale of any of such software or any portion thereof. Company’s
                    name, logo, and the product names associated with the Services are trademarks of Company or third
                    parties, and no right or licence is granted herein to use them. Company hereby grants Customer,
                    solely during the term of this Agreement, a limited, royalty-free, revocable licence to use and
                    install the Company provided software (which may include certificates and pack files) solely on
                    Customer’s machines and devices and only as necessary or appropriate to receive the Services (the

                <p>(b) Ownership of User Data. The Services may allow Customer to track and gather a range of data and

                    and all proprietary rights with respect to User Data and shall be solely responsible for its use
                    thereof. Customer is also responsible for securing and backing up its User Data and Company shall
                    only restore lost User Data to its last-backup point if the loss was due to a fault in Company’s
                    Services or Support Services. Customer hereby grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and
                    non-exclusive licence to access and use User Data for the sole purpose of enabling Company to
                    provide the Services, and for the limited purposes set forth in the Data Protection section and Data
                    Protection Addendum set out below.</p>

                <p>(c) Ownership of Reports and Analyses. Company may provide Customer with certain reports and analyses
                    as
                    part of the Services (“Reports”). Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all
                    proprietary rights with respect to such Reports. Company hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive,
                    non-sublicensable, and non-transferable licence, for the term of this Agreement, to use Reports
                    strictly for Customer’s own internal, legitimate, non-commercial, educational purposes.</p>

                <p>(d) Mobile App and Parent/Guardian Usage. Customer acknowledges that Users may need to download the
                    Company’s mobile application from the relevant major mobile device provider app stores (iTunes or
                    Google Play) and that use of the Company’s mobile application or website by parents/guardians is
                    subject to Company’s terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

                <p>(e) Feedback. If Customer provides any ideas, suggestions or recommendations to Company regarding
                    Company’s software, products, services or technology (“Feedback”), such Feedback is provided on a
                    non-confidential basis to Company and Company is free to retain, disclose, use and incorporate such

                    use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such Feedback, and that it has no right to compel such
                    use, display, reproduction, or distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an
                    obligation on Customer to provide Feedback to Company.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>

                <p>Customer Personal Data (as defined within the Data Protection Addendum) shall be processed in
                    accordance
                    with the terms set forth in the Data Protection Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit A. For the
                    purposes
                    of Annex 2 (Standard Contractual Clauses) to Exhibit E (Data Protection Addendum), Customer is the

                    inconsistencies
                    between the provisions of the Data Protection Addendum and any other agreements between the parties,
                    including this Agreement, the provisions of the Data Protection Addendum shall prevail.</p>

                <p>(a) The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider
                    to
                    Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of children
                    under the legal age of adulthood (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the
                    authorization of Customer, in order to provide the Services requested by Customer.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer expressly agrees that data relating to the Services that does not identify and cannot be
                    used
                    to identify any minor customer or any individual (“Aggregate Data”) is not Data or minor User Data

                <h2>6. Customer Responsibilities, Warranties and Restrictions</h2>

                <p>(a) Customer agrees that it shall not do any of the following: (i) modify, make derivative works of,
                    disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services (including any Client
                    Software), or in any way attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying ideas or
                    algorithms of any part of the Services (including any Client Software); (ii) access or use the
                    Services
                    (including any Client Software) in order to build a similar or competitive product or service or for
                    the
                    purposes of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Company; (iii) except as
                    expressly stated herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display, post or transmit
                    in
                    any form or by any means any of the Services (including any Client Software); (iv) attempt to gain
                    unauthorized access to the Services (and Customer shall make commercially reasonable endeavours to
                    prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing the Services (including any Client Software)); or
                    (v)
                    exceed the permitted number of devices, active users or students, teachers, faculty and staff in a
                    school or district, in each case as specified in an Order.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer shall not (i) access or attempt to access the administrative interface of the Services
                    by any
                    means other than through the interface that is provided by Company in connection with the Services,
                    unless otherwise agreed in writing or (ii) intentionally engage in any activity that interferes with
                    or
                    disrupts the Services (or any servers or networks that are connected to the Services).</p>

                <p>(c) Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under Customers’ accounts for the Services by
                    its
                    authorized users. Customer shall notify Company within a commercially reasonable time of any
                    unauthorized use of any user account or any unauthorized use of the Services. Customer may not
                    access
                    the Company Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or provide incorrect information
                    for
                    an Order for purposes of reducing amounts payable to Company.</p>

                <p>(d) Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Services only in
                    compliance with
                    the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Although Company
                    has
                    no obligation to monitor Customer’s use of the Services, Company may do so and may prohibit any use
                    of
                    the Services it reasonably believes may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of this Agreement or
                    applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <p>(e) Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Customer has taken all actions, complied
                    with all
                    requirements, obtained all prior consents and reviews, and otherwise satisfied all prerequisites
                    that
                    may be necessary or appropriate to enable Customer to enter into and perform this Agreement in
                    accordance with its terms and conditions; and (ii) the software for the Services provided under this
                    Agreement will be treated as “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software
                    documentation” under any applicable laws, regulations or rules.</p>

                <p>(f) If Customer is a government entity, unit, agency, organization, entity or party (including a
                    school or
                    school district), then Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that there is no
                    applicable
                    law, regulation, rule, or other governmental requirement (A) which in any way restricts or limits
                    the
                    duty of Customer to fully perform and comply with all obligations of Customer as set forth in this
                    Agreement, or (B) which impairs the rights of Company as set forth in this Agreement.</p>

                <p>(g) If any software or documentation is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United
                    States
                    Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or
                    “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with Company to
                    the
                    contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in the case of
                    civilian
                    agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD use, limited by the
                    terms
                    of this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.</p>

                <h2>7. Confidential Information</h2>

                <p>(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one
                    party
                    (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of
                    performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes,
                    documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or
                    information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which
                    otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also
                    include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture,
                    including
                    computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing
                    and
                    operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure
                    and
                    restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products,
                    product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User
                    Data.
                    Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes
                    public
                    through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or
                    rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently
                    developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential
                    Information.</p>

                <p>(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or
                    expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a
                    trade
                    secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall
                    hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the
                    Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless
                    required
                    by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the
                    same
                    degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no
                    event
                    will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s
                    Confidential
                    Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this
                    Agreement
                    and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and
                    other
                    personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are
                    under
                    binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential
                    Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
                    Recipient
                    shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will
                    implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential
                    Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized
                    disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by
                    the
                    processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose
                    Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court,
                    administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies
                    the
                    Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and
                    provides
                    the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate
                    action
                    to protect its Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient
                    shall not
                    acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient
                    shall
                    return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any
                    other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in
                    any
                    form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement.
                    Within
                    ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written
                    certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying
                    compliance
                    with this Section 7.</p>

                <p>(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and
                    conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be
                    difficult to
                    ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential
                    Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being
                    required
                    to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application
                    by
                    the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object
                    to
                    the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an
                    adequate
                    remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                    Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe
                    that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly,
                    through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                    This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser,
                    whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>

                <h2>8. Billing and Payment</h2>

                <p>The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the
                    Support Services by Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may
                    be
                    charged based on the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school
                    or
                    district, or (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an
                    Order. Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order.
                    The
                    Fees exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges (“Taxes”),
                    and
                    Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s
                    income)
                    and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as well as
                    government charges, and all reasonable expenses and legal fees Company incurs collecting late
                    amounts.
                    All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of
                    receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order or Customer is purchasing the Services
                    and
                    Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that Customer is to pay
                    the
                    authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer prior to receiving the
                    Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer. Late payments may bear interest at the
                    rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).To the fullest
                    extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges unless claimed within
                    sixty
                    (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside from those contemplated in
                    this
                    Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s website or otherwise published
                    by
                    Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only be modified as set forth below in
                    the
                    “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support
                    Services (or both) through an authorized reseller, Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and
                    Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly to the authorized reseller. Without
                    limiting
                    Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend
                    provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should
                    Customer
                    fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of the reason</p>

                <h2>9. Assignment</h2>

                <p>Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and interest in
                    all or any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written
                    notice
                    thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”). The Notice of Assignment shall provide the name and contact
                    information for the Assignee and shall instruct Customer to make payment of the assigned Fees to the
                    Assignee. Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the acknowledgement
                    provision
                    in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such Notice of Assignment and
                    (ii)
                    Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees to the Assignee,
                    notwithstanding
                    the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.</p>

                <h2>10. Term and Termination</h2>

                <p>(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
                    its
                    terms and conditions, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or, if
                    no
                    period is specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the “Initial
                    Term”). This Agreement will thereafter continue for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a
                    “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at least 30
                    days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term, together with all Renewal Terms,
                    are
                    collectively referred to as the “Term”.</p>

                <p>(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the
                    occurrence of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of
                    Default”
                    means a breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this
                    Agreement, if such breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of
                    written
                    notice from the other party.</p>

                <p>(c) Any and all provisions in this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to be performed after
                    the
                    termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination
                    or
                    expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, ownership of
                    materials,
                    payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability, effects
                    of
                    termination, and governing law.</p>

                <h2>11. Company Warranties, Company Disclaimers, and Exclusive Remedies</h2>

                <p>(a) Company warrants to Customer that it will provide the Services in all material respects as
                    described in
                    the applicable end user documentation, if any, and will provide such Services in a professional
                    manner
                    and in accordance with generally accepted industry practices. If the Services provided to Customer
                    are
                    not performed as warranted, Customer agrees that it must promptly provide a written notice to
                    Company
                    that describes the deficiency in the Services.</p>

                <p>(b) Company does not guarantee that (a) the Services will be performed error-free or uninterrupted,
                    or that
                    company will correct all errors, (b) the Services will operate in combination with customer’s
                    content or
                    applications, or with any other hardware, software, systems, Services or data not provided by
                    company,
                    and (c) the Services will meet customer’s or its users’ needs, requirements, specifications, or
                    expectations. Customer acknowledges that company does not control the transfer of data over
                    communications facilities, including the internet, and that the Services may be subject to
                    limitations,
                    delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities. Company is not
                    responsible for any issues related to the performance, operation or security of the Services that
                    arise
                    from Customer’s content or applications, or third party content or Services, and disclaims all

                    harmful, unsafe, or obscene content online, (b) that the Services will prevent or otherwise
                    discourage
                    cyberbullying or self-harm by students, (c) that the Services will detect all cyberbullying and
                    self-harm by students, or (e) all social media sites, streaming media, web-based email services,
                    cloud
                    storage sites, other internet sites (including porn, gambling and other inappropriate sites for
                    minors),
                    direct messages and electronic documents and files will be blocked or monitored.</p>

                <p>(d) For any breach of the Services warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy and Company’s entire
                    liability
                    shall be the correction of the deficient Services that caused the breach of warranty, or, if Company
                    cannot substantially correct the deficiency in a commercially reasonable manner (as determined
                    solely by
                    company in its reasonable discretion), then Customer may terminate the Services and Company will
                    refund
                    to Customer the fees for the terminated Services that Customer pre-paid to company for the period
                    following the effective date of termination. In such an event, company shall also exercise
                    commercially
                    reasonable endeavours to provide Customer with reasonable opportunity to access the Services for the
                    purposes of securing and backing up Customer’s User Data.</p>

                <p>(e) To the extent not prohibited by law, these warranties, terms and conditions are exclusive and
                    there are
                    no other warranties, terms and conditions, and Company hereby disclaims and excludes all other
                    warranties, terms and conditions whether statutory, express or implied, including any implied
                    warranties, terms or conditions of satisfactory quality, non-infringement and fitness for a
                    particular
                    purpose.</p>

                <p>(f) Use of Notify requires the use of a broadband or mobile data connection and a compatible device.
                    Company is not responsible for any disruption or failure of Notify due to delays, outages, or
                    disruptions in: (i) users’ data connection, (ii) mobile network operations, or (iii) the operation
                    of users’ devices. Using Notify on mobile devices may use voice or data allowances purchased from
                    mobile network operators. Using Notify out of the country may incur higher costs to users from their
                    mobile network operators.</p>

                    property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Customer for any damages finally awarded

                <h2>2. Security</h2>

                <p>Company represents and covenants that it maintains appropriate administrative, technical and physical

                <h2>4. Ownership</h2>

                <p>(a) Ownership of the Service; Intellectual Property. Company shall retain all title to and ownership
                    of and
                    all proprietary rights with respect to the Services (including all software used to provide the
                    Services
                    and all portions thereof (including all derivatives or improvements thereof)), whether or not
                    incorporated into or used with other software as a service, software or hardware. Customer’s use of
                    the
                    Services does not constitute a sale of any of such software or any portion thereof. Company’s name,
                    logo, and the product names associated with the Services are trademarks of Company or third parties,
                    and
                    no right or licence is granted herein to use them. Company hereby grants Customer, solely during the
                    term of this Agreement, a limited, royalty-free, revocable licence to use and install the Company
                    provided software (which may include certificates and pack files) solely on Customer’s machines and
                    devices and only as necessary or appropriate to receive the Services (the “Client Software”).</p>

                <p>(b) Ownership of User Data. The Services may allow Customer to track and gather a range of data and
                    information regarding its Users (“User Data”). Customer shall retain all title to and ownership of
                    and
                    all proprietary rights with respect to User Data, and shall be solely responsible for its use
                    thereof.
                    Customer is also responsible for securing and backing up its User Data and Company shall only
                    restore
                    lost User Data to its last-backup point if the loss was due to a fault in Company’s Services or
                    Support
                    Services. Customer hereby grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive licence to
                    access
                    and use User Data for the sole purpose of enabling Company to provide the Services, and for the
                    limited
                    purposes set forth in the Data Protection section and Data Protection Addendum set out below.</p>

                <p>(c) Ownership of Reports and Analyses. Company may provide Customer with certain reports and analyses
                    as
                    part of the Services (“Reports”). Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all
                    proprietary
                    rights with respect to such Reports. Company hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive,
                    non-sublicensable,
                    and non-transferable licence, for the term of this Agreement, to use Reports strictly for Customer’s
                    own
                    internal, legitimate, non-commercial, educational purposes.</p>

                <p>(d) Mobile App and Parent/Guardian Usage. Customer acknowledges that Users may need to download the
                    Company’s mobile application from the relevant major mobile device provider app stores (iTunes or
                    Google
                    Play) and that use of the Company’s mobile application or website by parents/guardians is subject to
                    Company’s terms of service and Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>(e) Feedback. If Customer provides any ideas, suggestions or recommendations to Company regarding
                    Company’s
                    software, products, services or technology (“Feedback”), such Feedback is provided on a
                    non-confidential
                    basis to Company and Company is free to retain, disclose, use and incorporate such Feedback in
                    Company’s
                    and/or its affiliates’ products and services, without payment of royalties or other consideration to
                    Customer. Customer understands and agrees that Company is not obligated to use, display, reproduce,
                    or
                    distribute any such Feedback, and that it has no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or
                    distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation on Customer to provide
                    Feedback to Company.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>

                <p>(a) Customer Personal Data (as defined within the Data Protection Addendum) shall be
                    processed in accordance with the terms laid out within the Data Protection Addendum and Securly’s
                    Privacy Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of inconsistencies between the provisions
                    of
                    the Data Protection Addendum and any other agreements between the parties, including this Agreement,
                    the
                    provisions of the Data Protection Addendum shall prevail.
                    The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider to
                    Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of children
                    under the legal age of adulthood (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the
                    authorization of Customer, in order to provide the Services requested by Customer.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer expressly agrees that data relating to the Services that does not identify and cannot be
                    used
                    to identify any minor customer or any individual (“Aggregate Data”) is not Data or minor User Data
                    and
                    Securly may maintain and use such data for its own purposes as set forth in the Privacy Policy,
                    provided
                    it has implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent the re-identification of Aggregate Data.</p>

                <h2>6. Customer Responsibilities, Warranties and Restrictions</h2>

                <p>(a) Customer agrees that it shall not do any of the following: (i) modify, make derivative works of,
                    disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services (including any Client

                    algorithms of any part of the Services (including any Client Software); (ii) access or use the
                    Services
                    (including any Client Software) in order to build a similar or competitive product or service or for
                    the
                    purposes of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Company; (iii) except as
                    expressly stated herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display, post or transmit
                    in
                    any form or by any means any of the Services (including any Client Software); (iv) attempt to gain
                    unauthorized access to the Services (and Customer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
                    prevent
                    unauthorized third parties from accessing the Services (including any Client Software)); or (v)
                    exceed
                    the permitted number of devices, active users or students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school
                    or
                    district, in each case as specified in an Order.</p>

                <p>(b) Customer shall not (i) access or attempt to access the administrative interface of the Services
                    by any
                    means other than through the interface that is provided by Company in connection with the Services,
                    unless otherwise agreed in writing or (ii) intentionally engage in any activity that interferes with
                    or
                    disrupts the Services (or any servers or networks that are connected to the Services).</p>

                <p>(c) Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under Customers’ accounts for the Services by
                    its
                    authorized users. Customer shall notify Company within a commercially reasonable time of any
                    unauthorized use of any user account or any unauthorized use of the Services. Customer may not
                    access
                    the Company Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or provide incorrect information
                    for
                    an Order for purposes of reducing amounts payable to Company.</p>

                <p>(d) Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Services only in
                    compliance with
                    the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Although Company
                    has
                    no obligation to monitor Customer’s use of the Services, Company may do so and may prohibit any use
                    of
                    the Services it reasonably believes may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of this Agreement or
                    applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <p>(e) Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Customer has taken all actions, complied
                    with all
                    requirements, obtained all prior consents and reviews, and otherwise satisfied all prerequisites
                    that
                    may be necessary or appropriate to enable Customer to enter into and perform this Agreement in
                    accordance with its terms and conditions; and (ii) the software for the Services provided under this
                    Agreement will be treated as “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software
                    documentation” under any applicable laws, regulations or rules.</p>

                <p>(f) If Customer is a government entity, unit, agency, organization, entity or party (including a
                    school or
                    school district), then Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that there is no
                    applicable
                    law, regulation, rule, or other governmental requirement (A) which in any way restricts or limits
                    the
                    duty of Customer to fully perform and comply with all obligations of Customer as set forth in this
                    Agreement, or (B) which impairs the rights of Company as set forth in this Agreement.</p>

                <p>(g) If any software or documentation is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United
                    States
                    Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or
                    “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with Company to
                    the
                    contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in the case of
                    civilian
                    agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD use, limited by the
                    terms
                    of this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.</p>

                <h2>7. Confidential Information</h2>

                <p>(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one
                    party
                    (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of
                    performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes,
                    documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or
                    information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which
                    otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also
                    include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture,
                    including
                    computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing
                    and
                    operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure
                    and
                    restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products,
                    product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User
                    Data.
                    Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes
                    public
                    through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or
                    rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently
                    developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential
                    Information.</p>

                <p>(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or
                    expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a
                    trade
                    secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall
                    hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the
                    Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless
                    required
                    by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the
                    same
                    degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no
                    event
                    will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s
                    Confidential
                    Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this
                    Agreement
                    and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and
                    other
                    personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are
                    under
                    binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential
                    Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
                    Recipient
                    shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will
                    implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential
                    Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized
                    disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by
                    the
                    processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose
                    Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court,
                    administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies
                    the
                    Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and
                    provides
                    the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate
                    action
                    to protect its Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient
                    shall not
                    acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient
                    shall
                    return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any
                    other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in
                    any
                    form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement.
                    Within
                    ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written
                    certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying
                    compliance
                    with this Section 7.</p>

                <p>(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and
                    conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be
                    difficult to
                    ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential
                    Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being
                    required
                    to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application
                    by
                    the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object
                    to
                    the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an
                    adequate
                    remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                    Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe
                    that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly,
                    through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
                    This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser,
                    whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>

                <h2>8. Billing and Payment</h2>

                <p>The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the
                    Support Services by Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may
                    be
                    charged based on the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school
                    or
                    district, or (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an
                    Order. Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order.
                    The
                    Fees exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges (“Taxes”),
                    and
                    Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s
                    income)
                    and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as well as
                    government charges, and all reasonable expenses and legal fees Company incurs collecting late
                    amounts.
                    If Customer is required by a governmental taxing authority to withhold an amount from any payment
                    due
                    hereunder and pay such amount to the governmental authority, the prices will be grossed-up so that
                    the
                    net payment equals the original price. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in
                    U.S.
                    Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order, or
                    Customer is purchasing the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the
                    parties
                    have agreed that Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made
                    by
                    the Customer prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer.
                    Late
                    payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate
                    permitted
                    by law, if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to
                    charges unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations
                    aside from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on
                    Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees
                    may
                    only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If
                    Customer
                    is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller, Customer
                    shall
                    pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly to the
                    authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity,
                    Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to
                    terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of
                    the
                    reason.</p>

                <h2>9. Assignment</h2>

                <p>Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and interest in
                    all or any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written
                    notice
                    thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”). The Notice of Assignment shall provide the name and contact
                    information for the Assignee and shall instruct Customer to make payment of the assigned Fees to the
                    Assignee. Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the acknowledgement
                    provision
                    in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such Notice of Assignment and
                    (ii)
                    Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees to the Assignee,
                    notwithstanding
                    the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.</p>

                <h2>10. Term and Termination</h2>

                <p>(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
                    its
                    terms and conditions, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or, if
                    no
                    period is specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the “Initial
                    Term”). This Agreement will thereafter continue for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a
                    “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at least 30
                    days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term, together with all Renewal Terms,
                    are
                    collectively referred to as the “Term”.</p>

                <p>(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the
                    occurrence of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of
                    Default”
                    means a breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this
                    Agreement, if such breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of
                    written
                    notice from the other party.</p>

                <p>(c) Any and all provisions in this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to be performed after
                    the
                    termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination
                    or
                    expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, ownership of
                    materials,
                    payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability, effects

                <h2>11. Company Warranties, Company Disclaimers, and Exclusive Remedies</h2>

                <p>(a) Company warrants to Customer that it will provide the Services in all material respects as
                    described in
                    the applicable end user documentation, if any, and will provide such Services in a professional
                    manner
                    and in accordance with generally accepted industry practices. If the Services provided to Customer
                    are
                    not performed as warranted, Customer agrees that it must promptly provide a written notice to
                    Company
                    that describes the deficiency in the Services.</p>

                <p>(b) Company does not guarantee that (a) the Services will be performed error-free or uninterrupted,
                    or that
                    company will correct all errors, (b) the Services will operate in combination with customer’s
                    content or
                    applications, or with any other hardware, software, systems, Services or data not provided by
                    company,
                    and (c) the Services will meet customer’s or its users’ needs, requirements, specifications, or
                    expectations. Customer acknowledges that company does not control the transfer of data over
                    communications facilities, including the internet, and that the Services may be subject to
                    limitations,
                    delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities. Company is not
                    responsible for any issues related to the performance, operation or security of the Services that
                    arise
                    from Customer’s content or applications, or third party content or Services, and disclaims all
                    liabilities arising from or related to third party content or Services.</p>

                <p>(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company does not guarantee
                    or
                    warrant (a) that the Services will function to prevent minors from being exposed to inappropriate,
                    harmful, unsafe, or obscene content online, (b) that the Services will prevent or otherwise
                    discourage
                    cyberbullying or self-harm by students, (c) that the Services will detect all cyberbullying and
                    self-harm by students, or (e) all social media sites, streaming media, web-based email services,
                    cloud
                    storage sites, other internet sites (including porn, gambling and other inappropriate sites for
                    minors),
                    direct messages and electronic documents and files will be blocked or monitored.</p>

                <p>(d) For any breach of the Services warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy and Company’s entire
                    liability
                    shall be the correction of the deficient Services that caused the breach of warranty, or, if Company
                    cannot substantially correct the deficiency in a commercially reasonable manner (as determined
                    solely by
                    company in its reasonable discretion), then Customer may terminate the Services and Company will
                    refund
                    to Customer the fees for the terminated Services that Customer pre-paid to company for the period
                    following the effective date of termination. In such an event, company shall also exercise
                    commercially
                    reasonable efforts to provide Customer with reasonable opportunity to access the Services for the
                    purposes of securing and backing up Customer’s User Data.</p>

                <p>(e) To the extent not prohibited by law, these warranties, terms and conditions are exclusive and
                    there are
                    no other warranties, terms and conditions, and Company hereby disclaims and excludes all other
                    warranties, terms and conditions whether statutory, express or implied, including any implied
                    warranties, terms or conditions of satisfactory quality, non-infringement and fitness for a
                    particular
                    purpose.</p>

                <p>(f) Use of Notify requires the use of a broadband or mobile data connection and a compatible device.
                    Company is not responsible for any disruption or failure of Notify due to delays, outages, or
                    disruptions in: (i) users’ data connection, (ii) mobile network operations, or (iii) the operation
                    of users’ devices. Using Notify on mobile devices may use voice or data allowances purchased from
                    mobile network operators. Using Notify out of the country may incur higher costs to users from their
                    mobile network operators.</p>

                <p>(a) Excluded Liabilities. BOTH PARTIES EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE
                    LIABLE TO

                    attributable to Customer’s use of the Service (other than as expressly set forth in Section 12(b)
                    below), and shall indemnify Company for any settlements or damages finally awarded against, and for

                    Customer by
                    a third party alleging that Customer’s use of the Service infringes or misappropriates the
                    intellectual

                    action or omission of Customer for which Customer is obligated to indemnify Company under this

                <p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
                    breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of
                    the
                    scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San
                    Francisco, California, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant
                    to
                    its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any
                    court
                    having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid
                    of
                    arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitrator may, in the award, allocate all
                    or
                    part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator and the reasonable
                    attorneys’
                    fees of the prevailing party (as defined by California Civil Code Section 1717). The parties agree
                    that
                    any award rendered by the arbitrators appointed pursuant to this clause shall be enforceable under
                    the
                    procedures set forth in the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
                    (the "New York Convention") even if Customer’s origin country has not ratified the New York
                    Convention.</p>

                <h2>25. Governmental Approval Obligations</h2>

                    maintenance in full force and effect of all governmental approvals, stamps, consents, licenses,
                    authorizations, declarations, filings, and registrations as may be necessary or advisable for the
                    performance of all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all
                    approvals which may be required to realize the purpose of this Agreement.</p>

                <h2>26. Entire Agreement</h2>

                <p>This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and the Data Protection Addendum constitute the
                    entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
                    prior
                    and contemporaneous oral or written representations, agreements or communications, including,
                    without
                    limitation, any quotations or proposals submitted by Company that are not shown in the Order or any
                    policies or terms for the Services posted on www.securly.com other than the Data Protection
                    Addendum.
                    The parties agree that in entering into this Agreement they have not relied upon any representation
