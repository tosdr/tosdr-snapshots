Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (&ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

<li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
<li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>

<h3>Retention time</h3>
