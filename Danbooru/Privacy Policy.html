    <h4>How Information About You Is Shared</h4>

    <p><em>Summary: Most activity on Danbooru is public. We

    under certain conditions.</em></p>

    <p>When you use the Site, certain information about you may be shared with
    other users, with Site moderators or other authorized users, or with the
    general public. For example:</p>

    <ul class="list-bulleted">
      <li>
        Any content you create or submit to the Site will be visible to other
        users and to the general public, unless stated otherwise. This includes
        your uploads, comments, forum posts, pools, wiki pages, translation
        notes, and any other contributions you make to the Site.
      </li>

      <li>
        Any edits you make to the Site will be visible to other users and to
        the general public, unless stated otherwise. This includes your tag
        edits, pool edits, wiki edits, translation note edits, artist edits,
        commentary edits, and any other kind of edit, change, or modification
        you make to any other content on the Site.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your other personal activities on the Site, such as your favorites,
        favorite groups, and saved searches, will normally be visible to other
        users and to the general public, unless stated otherwise, or you choose
        to make these things private.
      </li>

      <li>
        Certain information, such as your favorites or favorite groups, you may
        choose to make private. This information may still be visible to Site
        moderators or to other authorized users in connection with legitimate
        needs in operating the Site.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your username will be publicly associated with any content you create
        or edit on the Site. The date and time you created or edited the
        content will also be publicly visible. Moderators may also be able to
        see the IP address associated with any content you create or edit on
        the Site.
      </li>

      <li>
        When other users view your profile, they will be able to see

        and the date and time the message was sent. Recipients may choose to
        share your message publicly or with other users. Recipients may
        choose to have private messages forwarded to their email accounts and,
        as a result, any messages received by those users will be subject to
        the terms and policies of the userâs email provider.
      </li>

      <li>
        We may, at our sole discretion, allow Site moderators or other
        authorized users to view private messages for legitimate needs in
        connection with operating the Site, such as to prevent spam or to
        enforce our Terms of Service.
      </li>

      <li>
        We may allow third parties to access, collect, archive, or redistribute

    </ul>

    <p>Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information
    to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>

    <ul class="list-bulleted">
      <li>
        <strong>With your consent</strong>.
        We may share your information with your consent or at your direction.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>With our service providers</strong>.
        We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service
        providers (but not with advertisers or ad partners) who need access to
        such information to carry out work for us. The partner's use of
        personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and
        security measures.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Aggregated or anonymized information</strong>.
        We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized
        such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we
        may show the total number of times a post has been visited without
        identifying who the visitors were, or how many times a tag has been
        searched without identifying who the searchers were.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>To enforce our policies and rights</strong>.
        We may share information if we believe your actions are in violation of
        our user agreements, rules, or other policies, or to protect the
        rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>To comply with the law</strong>.
        We may share information in response to a request for information if we
        believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable
        law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not
        limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To
        the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior
        notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>In an emergency</strong>.
        We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent
        and serious bodily harm to a person.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Business transfers</strong>. We may share or transfer your
        information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,
        sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion
        of our business to another company.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Summary: If you link other sites to your Danbooru

    <p>We may offer you the ability to sign up or login using third-party

    address, profile picture, as well as other information included in your
    public profile.

    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are

    services for marketing purposes without your consent. We will not disclose
    any information about you or your usage of our Site to any third-party

    policies to understand how they collect, use and share your personal
    information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites

    account. Comments, forum posts, or messages posted by other users
    mentioning you by name or quoting you will still be visible to others.</p>

    <p>We may retain certain other information about you even after you
    deactivate your account, including your IP address, your user ID, your past
    usernames, and other identifiers associated with your account. We may
    retain this information as required by law or as necessary for legitimate
    business needs, such as for preventing spam, abuse, or violations of our
    Terms of Service.</p>

    <h6>Controlling Email Communications</h6>

    may unsubscribe by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we

    <p>Persons under the age of 18 are not allowed to create an account or
    otherwise use our Services. By using our Services, you represent that you
    are over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account
    or otherwise use our Services.</p>

    <h6>Data Retention</h6>

    <p><em>Summary: We keep your information for as long as
    necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless
    otherwise required by law.</em></p>

    <p>We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for
    the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain
    information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>

    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
    personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is
    not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
    possible.</p>

    <h6>International Data Transfers</h6>

    <p><em>Summary: We store data in the United States and operate under US law.</em></p>

    <p>We are based in the United States and we process and store information
    on servers located in the United States. We may store information on
    servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors,
    including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or
    using the Site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to
    the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and
    other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under
    local law.</p>

    <h6>Information Security</h6>

    <p><em>Summary: We take reasonable measures to secure your
    data. We will promptly notify you of breaches of your personal
    information.</em></p>

    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from
    loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
    destruction. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls
    to limit access to non-public personal information by staff members or
    designated representatives of Danbooru. However, although we will
    do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
    information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
    access our Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <p>In the event that we become aware of a privacy breach which has resulted
    or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your personal
    information, we will investigate the matter and promptly notify you and the
    applicable Supervisory Authority of the breach, unless the breach is
    unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
    persons.</p>

    <h6>Changes to this Policy</h6>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy
    will be indicated by a new "Last updated" date at the top of this page. If
    we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may, at our discretion,
    notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
    directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
    Privacy Policy frequently to stay informed of how we handle your personal
