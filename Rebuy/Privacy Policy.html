<h4 id="international-rights">ADDITIONAL EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL DATA RIGHTS</h4>
<p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and certain other countries’ data protection laws provide certain rights for data subjects. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or another country with data protection laws that provide for certain data subject rights, you may submit a request to exercise your rights.</p>
<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><span></span>Depending on your country of residence, your rights may include:</li>
<li><span></span>The right to be informed - that’s an obligation on us to inform you how we use your personal data (and that’s what we’re doing in this Privacy Notice);</li>
<li><span></span>The right of access - that’s a right to make what’s known as a ‘data subject access request’ for a copy of the personal data we hold about you;</li>
<li><span></span>The right to rectification - that’s a right to make us correct personal data about you that may be incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your account);</li>
<li><span></span>The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) - that’s where in certain circumstances you can ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless there’s an overriding legal reason we need to keep it);</li>
<li><span></span>The right to restrict processing - that’s a right for you in certain circumstances to ask us to suspend processing personal data;</li>
<li><span></span>The right to data portability - that’s a right for you to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);</li>
<li><span></span>The right to object - that’s a right for you to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing); and</li>
<li><span></span>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling - that’s a right you have for us to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.</li>
<li><span></span>Withdraw Consent—that’s the right to revoke any consent you may have previously given us at any time, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li><span></span>File a complaint—that’s the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Exercising Your Rights</i></span></p>
<p>These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you are located in the European Economic Area and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.<br><br>In addition, if you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you. If you do so, we will promptly update our databases and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing the Services as requested and/or ordered by you or necessary updates regarding and the Services used by you.<br><br>Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please </span><a href="mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com" rel="noopener">contact us</a><span style="background-color: transparent;"> first.</span></p>
