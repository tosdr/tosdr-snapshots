Please be aware that this information may be required for certain bookings and we may not be able to complete such bookings without this information. In addition, our Services may include text boxes that are designed for you to describe certain details about your travel preferences or special requests that you want us or our travel partners to know, which may also be more sensitive in nature. Please be aware that information you freely submit in these boxes may reveal to us or to the travel partners or third parties with whom we share information (as detailed in the <a href="#shareinfo">How We Share Your Information</a> section below) certain information that may be considered sensitive personal information under applicable law (for example, information about dietary restrictions or disability accommodations). Lastly, certain features of our Services may prompt your device or browser to request access to your precise geolocation information, which may be considered sensitive personal information. We do not process precise geolocation absent you granting permission through your device or browser. Where you have voluntarily consented to our processing of your sensitive personal information, you may revoke such consent at any time by contacting us at the details set out in the <a href="#contactus">How to Contact Us</a> section below.</p><p><strong>Personal Information Generated By Us.</strong> As you use our Services, we generate certain personal information about you, including through automatic data collection and by inferences based on the information we collect about you and your activity. We may automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services or communications you receive (such as email) using certain technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our <a href="#trackingtools">Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising Policy</a> for more details). We generate the following categories of personal information about you:</p><ul><li><strong>Device information.</strong> When you visit or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information about your device (e.g., your mobile device, computer, or tablet), including information about your hardware and software, device configuration, and nearby networks. Such data may include data about your device operating systems, browsers, and other software installed on your device; such as IP address or other device identifier; country of origin, region and language settings; and information about domain servers and wireless or network access points near your device.</li><li><strong>Usage and performance information.</strong> We also automatically collect personal information about your usage of the Services, including information about your searches, statistics about the travel itineraries you share with us, how you interact with the features of our Services and the links you click, your preferences, access times, referring URL, and performance of our Services.</li><li><strong>Location information.</strong> If you use our Services, we automatically collect approximate location information about you (such as your city) or, with your consent, precise geographic location data from your mobile device when the app is running and when it is not running, depending on the choices you make when you are asked to consent to our collection of location information. The technologies we use to determine your location may include IP address mapping, cell tower position, Wi-Fi position and GPS signals. We may use and store this information to provide and improve features of our Services, for example, to tailor our Services on a needs-based manner to better facilitate your requests (such as helping you find the hotel closest to you) and to provide you with more relevant content in the cities you visit (such as sending you marketing communications relating to goods or services in your current city, including local accommodations and travel options). KAYAK does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location-based features and functionality offered. Please see the <a href="#choicesandrights">Your Rights and Choices</a> section below for more information about how to adjust your preferences, including those related to location information.</li><li><strong>Inferences about you.</strong> We combine the information we collect, generate, or otherwise obtain to draw inferences about your preferences and interests in order to provide and personalize our Services and tailor the advertising we and our partners display or offer to you.</li><li><strong>Emails you synchronize with your Trips account.</strong> If you sign up to synchronize your email inbox to your Trips account, you authorize us to access the emails in the email accounts you have connected to your Trips account in order to create travel itineraries. This involves automatically scanning your inbox at regular intervals to identify emails that are booking confirmations, which are then parsed automatically or manually for relevant travel details and imported into our Trips service (along with a copy of the email, which is saved to your Trips account). See the Trips Services section below for more information.</li></ul><p><strong>Personal Information We Obtain from Third Parties.</strong> We may also receive certain categories of personal information from third parties, such as third-party websites, applications, social media networks, and services (each, a <strong><span>“third-party platform”</span></strong>), our group companies, travel partners, and other third parties, including individuals who have shared their travel itineraries with you through our Trips service. If you are an existing KAYAK user, we will combine this information with information we collect through our Services and use and share it for the purposes described below.
