<h3 id="1-a-name-a1-a-your-access-to-the-app">1. <a name="a1"></a> YOUR ACCESS TO THE APP</h3>

<p>Your use of the App under these Terms is also subject to any terms, rules or policies of any app store provider and/or operator (“App Store Provider”) from whom you have downloaded the App (“App Store Terms”). In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any App Store Terms, the App Store Terms will prevail. You and we acknowledge and agree that the relevant App Store Provider is a third party beneficiary under these Terms and will have the right to enforce these Terms against you directly.</p>

<p>We and our service providers are responsible for any maintenance and support of the App and you acknowledge that any App Store Provider from whom you download the App is not under any obligation to you to carry out any maintenance and/or support for the App itself. You acknowledge that we are under no obligation to carry out maintenance and/or support of the App and do so entirely at our discretion.</p>

<p>These Terms apply to the App including any updates or supplements to the App, unless such updates or supplements are accompanied by separate terms, in which case those terms apply. We may change these Terms at any time by notifying you of a change when you next start the App. The updated Terms will be displayed on-screen and you will be required to agree to them to continue your use of the App. The date these Terms were last updated appears at the bottom of these Terms.</p>

<p>From time to time we may issue updates to the App. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the App until you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms. Some updates may not be available to certain models of device. In order to use the App, you may be required to obtain certain updates and/or upgrades to your device. You are responsible for any costs and/or fees associated with any such updates/upgrades. You also understand and accept that: (a) the device you use to access the App will require certain software in order for the App to work correctly and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the required up-to-date software, and (b) the App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the functionality of the App meets your requirements.</p>

<p>You may only download and install the App onto a device that you own, or if you do not own the device, you must have the permission from the owner(s) to do so. You accept responsibility under these Terms for the use of the App, whether or not you own the device onto which the App is downloaded and installed. You also acknowledge that the owner(s) of the device onto which the App is installed may be charged by any relevant mobile network operator and/or internet service provider in relation to any data and/or mobile connectivity used by the App.</p>

<p>Access to the App may be suspended temporarily and without notice: (a) in the case of system failure, (b) for maintenance or repair, &copy; where we reasonably suspect there has been a breach of these Terms, (d) for reasons beyond our control, or (e) as otherwise explained in these Terms.</p>

<h3 id="2-a-name-a2-a-permitted-use-and-restrictions">2. <a name="a2"></a> PERMITTED USE AND RESTRICTIONS</h3>

<p>In consideration of you agreeing to abide by these Terms, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence (i.e. permission) to use the App subject to these Terms. We reserve all other rights, which are not granted in these Terms.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, the use, reproduction and distribution of components of the App licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3) license and terms are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license.</p>

<p>You must not use the App: (a) in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or to act fraudulently or maliciously, for example, by hacking into or inserting malicious code, including viruses, or harmful data, into the App or any operating system used by the App, (b) in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users, &copy; to collect or harvest any information or data from the App or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the App, (d) to send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with these Terms, or (e) to transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).</p>

<h3 id="3-a-name-a3-a-security-and-passwords">3. <a name="a3"></a> SECURITY AND PASSWORDS</h3>

If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your password or any other authentication information, you should promptly notify us using the contact details below. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur through use of your password. We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App.</p>

<p>We do not have any access to your password or the data held in your App. In the event that you forget your password you will be required to delete the App, reinstall it and set up a new password in order to regain access to the App. As a security precaution, resetting the App will wipe your data.

<h3 id="5-a-name-a5-a-privacy">5. <a name="a5"></a> PRIVACY</h3>

Our Privacy Policy explains how your personal information will be collected and used as well as other information regarding your privacy (such as how you can adjust your privacy settings).</p>

<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy and you consent to (i) the processing of your personal information as explained in the Privacy Policy and (ii) the collection of information from your device as explained in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="6-a-name-a6-a-intellectual-property-rights">6. <a name="a6"></a> INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>

<p>Except where noted, you acknowledge that all intellectual property rights to code and content in the App anywhere in the world belong to us or our licensors, that rights in the App are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the App other than the right to use it in accordance with these Terms. We acknowledge that anything created, written, shared or stored by you through the functionality of the app is your intellectual property.</p>

<p>In the event that anyone brings a claim that the App or any part of it, or your possession and/or use, infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, we (and not any third party App Store Provider, including without limitation Google) shall be responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such claim.</p>

<h3 id="7-a-name-a7-a-user-content">7. <a name="a7"></a> USER CONTENT</h3>

<p>Whenever you make use of a feature that allows you to upload any content such as any text, audio, video, or other content via the App (“User Content”), or to share any User Content with other users of the App, you promise that any such User Content: (a) will not be defamatory, obscene, offensive or otherwise objectionable, (b) will not infringe the intellectual property rights (such as copyright) or other rights (such as privacy or confidentiality) of any third party, &copy; will comply with applicable law (d) will not promote violence or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age, (e) will not be likely to deceive any person, (f) will not be threatening, abusive or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety, (g) will not be likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person, (h) will not impersonate any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person, (i) will not give the impression that it emanates from us, if this is not the case, and (j) will not advocate, promote or assist any unlawful act such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.</p>

<h3 id="12-a-name-a12-a-other-important-terms">12. <a name="a12"></a> OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS</h3>

<p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce any of our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived any of our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>

<p>Each of the conditions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect. Other than as expressly set out in these Terms, no one other than you and us is intended to have any right or ability to enforce any of the provisions of these Terms.</p>

<p>These Terms are governed by English law and the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Umbrella app (the “App”) is provided to you by Security First Technologies Ltd of Cluster, 1-3 Westmoreland Street, Dublin 2, D02 VK03, Ireland, company number: 625599 (“GSF”, “us”, or “we”).</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with our Terms of Use located on our website at www.secfirst.org (the “Terms”)) applies to your use of the App and sets out the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information and how it will be treated.</p>

<p>By downloading and installing the App onto your device or clicking on the &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; button below you are consenting to the processing of your personal information as explained in this policy.</p>

<h3 id="1-a-name-b1-a-information-we-may-collect-from-you-and-how-we-use-it">1. <a name="b1"></a> INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW WE USE IT</h3>

<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>

<p><strong>Submitted Information</strong></p>

<p>We do not collect any information about you when downloading or using the App. Though the use of a 3rd Party App store (such as Google Play) to download the app means they may be able to track certain information about you.</p>

<p>We do not track your location. If you request information from the dashboard on an area, you simply submit the location you are interested in. The most specific information the App collects is to country level. The only information collected is an anonymised country code and time of request log. We do this so that we can pull the updated data from the external provider site.</p>

<p>The only instance in which we collect personal information about you is if report a problem. If you choose to report a problem with the App we will store the complaint and message data submitted. This kind of information may include your name and email address and other contact details. We use this information to make note of reoccurring problems and to enable us to provide a good level of customer service.</p>

<h3 id="2-a-name-b2-a-where-we-store-your-anonymised-requests">2. <a name="b2"></a> WHERE WE STORE YOUR ANONYMISED REQUESTS</h3>

<p>The anonymised information that we do collect is stored in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="3-a-name-b3-a-passwords-and-security">3. <a name="b3"></a> PASSWORDS AND SECURITY</h3>

<p>We recommend you use a password. If you want to save your checklists and keep an eye on your progress, we recommend you put a password on the app. This will encrypt the app. If someone gets their hands on your phone you don’t want them knowing which security protocols you’ve implemented and which you haven’t. We haven’t made this compulsory in case you weren’t storing much, but we think you’re better safe than sorry. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur through use of your password, even if another person was using your account at the relevant time. We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted via the App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your anonymised information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<h3 id="4-a-name-b4-a-disclosing-your-information">4. <a name="b4"></a> DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We do not hold any personally identifiable information about you. We will only disclose any anonymised information to third parties: (a) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request, (b) if it is necessary to investigate any potential breaches or enforce any part of the Terms or other agreements or &copy; to protect the rights, property or safety of GSF, our users, or others.</p>

<p>Whenever you make use of a feature that allows you to share any User Content with others, please note that such User Content will fall under the same security risks as general communications and could be read, collected or used by others. When you use these features, you must ensure that you do not submit any personal information that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users. We are not responsible for personal information that you have made available to other users.</p>

<h3 id="5-a-name-b5-a-third-party-sites-and-services">5. <a name="b5"></a> THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h3>

<p>Your use of the App will also be subject to the privacy policies of any app store provider and/or operator (“App Store Provider”) from whom you have downloaded the App (“App Store Policies”). The App may also contain links to other third party websites and services (“Third Party Sites and Services”). The links to Third Party Sites and Services are provided for your convenience only. Your use of the Third Party Sites and Services will be governed by their terms and conditions and privacy policies (if any) (“Third Party Terms”). It is your responsibility to read the Third Party Terms. You acknowledge that we have no control over the Third Party Sites and Services and are not responsible for them.</p>

<h3 id="6-a-name-b6-a-cancelling-your-account">6. <a name="b6"></a> CANCELLING YOUR ACCOUNT</h3>
