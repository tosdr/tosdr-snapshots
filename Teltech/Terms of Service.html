<p><strong>20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION; GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOUR AND OUR ABILITY TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND US</strong> <strong>FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE</strong> <strong>AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. WE</strong> <strong>AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY’S CLAIMS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IN THE SECTION TITLED “OPTING OUT OF ARBITRATION” IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Claims Subject to this Section</strong>. The dispute resolution and binding arbitration terms in this section apply to all Claims between you and us. A “<strong>Claim</strong>” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or our Teams Services, including any related to privacy or data-security or to the formation, validity, enforceability, revocability, performance, breach, or scope of the Terms or arbitration agreement or any portion of it or arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of the Terms or arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration</strong>. If you have a Claim against us or if we have a Claim against you, you and we must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally in order to try to resolve the Claim faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and we will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties, (“<strong>Informal Resolution Period</strong>”) from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “<strong>Claimant Notice</strong>”) in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>You will send any Claimant Notice to us by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to bspoperations@legalmail.it. We will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to us or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to us. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. The Informal Resolution Period is intended to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or we cannot initiate arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or we file a Claim in court or initiate arbitration without first providing a compliant Claimant Notice and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court or arbitrator to enjoin the filing or arbitration and seek damages from the party that has not followed the informal dispute-resolution process to reimburse it for any costs and fees—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.</p>
<p>The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim shall be tolled for the duration of the Information Resolution Period for that Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.</p>
<p><strong>Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions</strong>. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or us, including any disputes in which you or we seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or our intellectual property (“<strong>IP Claims</strong>”), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with the above section will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Individual Arbitration</strong>. Subject to the terms of this section, Claims may only be adjudicated by binding individual arbitration conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“<strong>NAM</strong>”), <a href="https://namadr.com/">https://namadr.com</a>, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., (“<strong>FAA”</strong>) and NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Claim arose (the “<strong>Rules”</strong>), as modified by these Terms.</p>
<p>If NAM notifies the parties in writing (email suffices) that it is not available to arbitrate any Claim, then that Claim may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), <a href="https://www.adr.org/">https://www.adr.org</a>. For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” meaning that you only use the Teams Services for personal, family, or household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules apply to Claims between you and us, as modified by these Terms. For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are not a “Consumer,” the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures apply to Claims between you and us as modified by these Terms.</p>
<p>These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Procedure and Location</strong>. You or we may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with NAM (or with AAA if applicable pursuant to the above section).</p>
<p>Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling NAM at 800-358-2550, and instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to us by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to bspoperations@legalmail.it.. We will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to us or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to us.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and we both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or less, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks more than USD $10,000, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules.</p>
<p>The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; they cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Fees.</strong> Except for circumstances outlined in the following two sections, each party will be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Frivolous or Improper Claims.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs and fees incurred by the defending party—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the Claim was filed for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Offers of Settlement</strong>: Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer for a Claim. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable to a party than the latest written offer of settlement that party rejected, that party must pay all arbitration costs and fees incurred by the other party after the written settlement offer was made.</p>
<p><strong>One Year to Assert Claims. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR US AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU OR WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT CLAIM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> If you or we submit a Claim to arbitration, you and we agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and we agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Filings.</strong> If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “<strong>Coordinated Claims</strong>” and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Claims are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You or we may advise the other of your or our belief that Claims are Coordinated Claims, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Coordinated Claims” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter.</p>
<p><strong>COORDINATED CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE FILED IN ARBITRATION AS PERMITTED BY THE BELLWETHER PROCESS SET FORTH BELOW.</strong> <strong>APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL BE TOLLED FOR CLAIMS ASSERTED AS COORDINATED CLAIMS FROM THE TIME A COMPLIANT CLAIMANT NOTICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY A PARTY UNTIL THESE TERMS PERMIT SUCH COORDINATED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN ARBITRATION OR COURT.</strong></p>
<p>The bellwether process set forth in this section will not proceed until counsel representing the Coordinated Claims has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Coordinated Claims have been provided.</p>
<p>After that point, counsel for the parties shall select 20 Coordinated Claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its claims and arguments. Each side shall select 10 claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Claims will be delayed by this bellwether process.</p>
<p>A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Claim chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Claim may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p>Once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the other party agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Claims, with the mediator’s fee paid for by us. Counsel for the claimants and the other party must agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the other party cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.</p>
<p>If the mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining Coordinated Claims, the arbitration requirement in this section shall no longer apply to Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with section.</p>
<p>To the extent you are asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable.</p>
<p>If Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement are brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.</p>
<p>A court shall have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this section and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Arbitration</strong>. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days from the date when these Terms are notified to you by providing us with notice of your decision to opt out via email at bspoperations@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milano, Italy. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. If you opt out of this updated arbitration clause and were previously subject to an arbitration clause in effect prior to this updated arbitration clause, then that prior arbitration clause shall remain as the agreement between us. If you are a new user and did not previously consent to the prior arbitration clause and you choose to opt-out of this updated agreement, then we will also not be bound by this updated arbitration clause.</p>
<p><strong>Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any change we make to section (except address changes) by sending us notice of your rejection within 30 days of the change via email at bspoperations@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milano, Italy. Changes to section may only be rejected as a whole, and you may not reject only certain changes to section. If you reject changes made to section, the most recent version of section that you have not rejected will continue to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong>. If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong>. This Agreement and all modifications and amendments thereto, shall be governed by the law of the State of New York, United States without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles.</p>

24. SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS</strong></p>
<p>Additional supplemental terms apply to the following Services:</p>
<p><em><strong><br />
ROBOKILLER</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>General</strong>. Robokiller offers among other things, the ability to automatically block nuisance calls (robocalls, telemarketers, etc.), to forward nuisance calls to an Answer Bot selected by you or a default voicemail greeting, record and transcribe them, to blacklist and whitelist specific numbers and, if enabled, to block SMS spam messages. RoboKiller also offers automated call screening assistance. When an unrecognized number calls that is not (i) a contact, (ii) on your whitelist, or (iii) not clearly identified as spam, the automated call screening assistance feature will prompt the caller to state a name and purpose for the call, all of which is recorded, transcribed, and made available for your review. Android users will actively need to enable this feature. iOS users can disable this feature in the RoboKiller’s settings. Certain features may not be available in earlier versions of the application or on Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>Plans. </strong>Robokiller offers multiple plans to meet the needs of its customers. While all Users have access to basic features, subscribers to other plans have several additional features available to them depending on the chosen plan, such as call blocking, spam text protection, personal block lists, and personal data removal.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>. Robokiller uses a combination of telephone carrier network (“<strong>PSTN</strong>”) and Voice over IP (“<strong>VoIP</strong>”) to deliver calls to your Device. The technology and how calls are received on your Device are determined by your telephone carrier and the version of the operating system your Device is running when Robokiller is set up. If you upgrade your operating system version, it is recommended that you disable/deprogram your Device, uninstall, and reinstall Robokiller to ensure you have the best experience. Instructions on how to disable/re-program Robokiller can be found  in the settings menu of the App.</p>
<p><strong>Call Blocking/Forwarding</strong>. Activating the call blocking/forwarding feature means that certain incoming calls (e.g. declined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to Robokiller in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call - all before your phone rings). Calls from your Device’s contacts go directly to your Device. When you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number. </p>
<p>Please note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.</p>
<p><strong>Number Monitoring</strong>.  You agree to check the numbers and messages from blocked calls on your Device regularly to ensure that you whitelist any legitimate phone number so that it will not be blocked in the future. The Service also provides you the ability to create and modify a personal whitelist (&quot;<strong>Allow List</strong>&quot;) and blacklist (&quot;<strong>Block List</strong>&quot;). You can use the whitelist feature to ensure that a specific number is never blocked. You can add or remove users from your personal Allow List and Block List at any time. Please note that if you have requested a call from, or have an existing relationship with a debt relief company, collections company or if you provided your number to authorize a sales call to any company and you desire to continue receiving those calls, we advise you to add the number to your contacts or Allow List and to monitor your Robokiller messages for calls you may wish to return.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Microphone</strong>.   When you download Robokiller and begin the setup and activation process, Robokiller will ask permission to access your Device’s microphone. You must give Robokiller permission to access your Device’s microphone in order for the App to properly function. The Service uses your Device’s microphone to ensure you can talk to the caller when Robokiller initiates a VoIP call with a safe caller. </p>
<p><strong>Access to Contacts</strong>. In order to provide the Services, Robokiller must access the numbers in your Device’s address book.</p>
<p><strong>Answer Bots</strong>. Robokiller provides you the option to use its Answer Bots to respond to unwanted spam and robocallers. Answer Bots are pre-recorded audio messages. You can choose whichever Answer Bot you like or make your own audio content and recordings (“<strong>Audio(s)</strong>”). If you choose not to use Answer Bots, unwanted spam and robocallers will hear a very polite but concise default recording. When unwanted spam and robocaller engages with one of Robokiller’s Answer Bots, the conversation is recorded as a voicemail and saved within the App (“<strong>Answer Bot Recording''</strong>). By using Robokiller’s Answer Bot feature, you expressly authorize us to record Answer Bot conversations on your behalf. </p>
<p>Robokiller provides Users the ability to share Audios and Answer Bot Recordings. For every Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording you decide to share, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you will share Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings strictly from unsolicited, unwanted spam and robocallers and you will not share any Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings from people with whom you have established a relationship with (e.g., signing up to receive offers);</p></li>
<li><p>to the extent there is an identifiable person mentioned in your Audio and/or the Answer Bot Recording, you have obtained the appropriate rights, permissions and/or licenses from such person in order to share the Answer Bot Recording;</p></li>
<li><p>Bending Spoons will not need to obtain any rights, permissions and/or licenses from any third-party or pay royalties to any third-party in order to make the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording publically available;</p></li>
<li><p>the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording do not infringe any third-party’s rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and</p></li>
<li><p>the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording comply with this Agreement, all applicable laws as well as the terms of use of any Social Media platform or application.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Users may also share their own unique Answer Bot Audio creations with Robokiller either directly within the App or via email. As between you and Bending Spoons, you own the Audios that you create and submit to Robokiller. By submitting your Audios, you grant Bending Spoons and its affiliates, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereinafter created) and make derivative works from your Audios for the purpose of: (i) making the Audios available for review by Bending Spoons; (ii) providing the Audios on Social Media and other platforms; (iii) allowing other Robokiller Users to play, download and use your Audios within the App; (iv) promoting Robokiller’s Answer Bots, provided you have made your Audios publicly available; and (v) archiving or preserving the Audios for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations. You further grant all Robokiller Users the ability to view your Audios for personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the Audios solely to the extent necessary to view the Audios. The aforementioned licenses will continue unless and until you remove your Audios from the App, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely. </p>
<p>For every Audio you create and upload, post or transmit to Robokiller, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you have the right to submit the Audios to Robokiller and grant the licenses set forth herein;</p></li>
<li><p>your Audio is civil and respectful;</p></li>
<li><p>your Audio does not contain any sexually explicit content or pornography;</p></li>
<li><p>the Audio does not contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incites hatred against any individual or group;</p></li>
<li><p>your Audio does not harm or exploit minors;</p></li>
<li><p>your Audio does not discuss unlawful acts or extreme violence; and</p></li>
<li><p>the Audio does not promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>. Depending on the state or country in which you are located, the Answer Bot recording may violate laws requiring a person to obtain the consent of other parties on the call prior to recording the telephone conversation. You acknowledge and agree that as the individual directing the recording, you are solely responsible for determining the law in the state or country in which you are receiving calls prior to using the Answer Bot feature in that state or country. You agree not to enable the Answer Bot feature unless you have first determined that your use is legal.</p>
<p><strong>Voicemail and Call Screening Transcriptions</strong>. Your version of Robokiller may include transcription capabilities. Should you decide to deploy the transcription features, you acknowledge and expressly agree that Bending Spoons may transcribe or have transcribed by a third party and store or have stored by a third party, voicemail messages and call screening recording, and to make such transcriptions available to you.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Fingerprinting</strong>. Robokiller may extract relevant features in the first few seconds of an incoming call made to your Device. Robokiller is then able to identify an audio sample or rapidly match other similar features in an existing audio database in order to determine whether such incoming call is a robocall. This process proactively analyzes an audio sample within a call and is done moments before Robokiller alerts you of the nature of the call.</p>
<p><strong>Call Data Retention</strong>. We make no guarantees that we will retain certain call data such as calls, call recordings, voicemail, call screens, Answer Bots and transcriptions for greater than six (6) months, after which we may delete such call data. If you would like to retain this information, you can go to the App’s call details and share the information to your email or cloud storage account. You acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information.</p>
<p><strong>SMS Spam Protection</strong>. Robokiller provides you with the option to enable a SMS spam protection feature which will filter SMS and MMS messages from individuals not in your Device’s contacts. When you enable the SMS spam blocking feature and grant us permission, we will filter SMS text messages from individuals that are not in your Device’s contacts and attempt to block any spam messages. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Data Protection.</strong> Robokiller provides you with the option to purchase a personal data protection feature within the App. If purchased, the personal data protection service will regularly use your information to scan online data broker websites (“Data Sites”) for personal information about you. Sometimes these Data Sites are called people search sites. If online personal information about you is identified at these Data Sites, Robokiller or its designated third party partner will submit opt-out requests on your behalf to remove such personal information (“Opt-Out”). You can go to the App at any time to see if online personal information about you was found on these Data Sites and whether the Opt-Out was successful. Robokiller may change the Data Sites that are being scanned at any time without notice to you. In order to submit an Opt-Out request to remove your personal information from Data Sites, Robokiller, or its designated third party partner, may need to interact with Data Sites on your behalf.

<p><strong>General</strong>. Trapcall offers you the ability to learn who is calling you before answering a call by revealing caller ID information from blocked or unknown calls, to record calls, to have voicemails transcribed and to block unwanted calls by adding them to your Block List.</p>
<p><strong>Call Blocking Feature</strong>. In order to take advantage of TrapCall's call blocking feature, you may be asked to enable call forwarding/blocking features on your Device during the installation and App setup process. Activating the call forwarding/blocking features means that certain incoming calls (e.g., declined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to TrapCall in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call - all before your phone rings). Calls from your Device’s contacts go directly to your Device. When you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number. Please note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Contacts</strong>. In order for TrapCall to work correctly, we may also request during the onboarding process that we receive access to the numbers in your Device’s address book in order to whitelist them for you. Please note that we may not be able to provide these call forwarding and call blocking features if you do not choose to enable these functions or allow us access. </p>
<p><strong>Transcriptions</strong>. Your version of TrapCall may include voicemail transcription capabilities. If so, by using TrapCall, you acknowledge and expressly agree that Bending Spoons may transcribe or have transcribed by a third-party and store or have stored by a third-party vendor, such recordings, and to make such transcriptions available to you.</p>

You acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information. </p>

We will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to us or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to us. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. The Informal Resolution Period is intended to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or we cannot initiate arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or we file a Claim in court or initiate arbitration without first providing a compliant Claimant Notice and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court or arbitrator to enjoin the filing or arbitration and seek damages from the party that has not followed the informal dispute-resolution process to reimburse it for any costs and fees—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim shall be tolled for the duration of the Information Resolution Period for that Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClaims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions\u003c/strong\u003e.

Robokiller offers among other things, the ability to automatically block nuisance calls (robocalls, telemarketers, etc.), to forward nuisance calls to an Answer Bot selected by you or a default voicemail greeting, record and transcribe them, to blacklist and whitelist specific numbers and, if enabled, to block SMS spam messages. RoboKiller also offers automated call screening assistance. When an unrecognized number calls that is not (i) a contact, (ii) on your whitelist, or (iii) not clearly identified as spam, the automated call screening assistance feature will prompt the caller to state a name and purpose for the call, all of which is recorded, transcribed, and made available for your review. Android users will actively need to enable this feature. iOS users can disable this feature in the RoboKiller’s settings. Certain features may not be available in earlier versions of the application or on Android devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlans. \u003c/strong\u003eRobokiller offers multiple plans to meet the needs of its customers. While all Users have access to basic features, subscribers to other plans have several additional features available to them depending on the chosen plan, such as call blocking, spam text protection, personal block lists, and personal data removal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunctionality\u003c/strong\u003e.

The technology and how calls are received on your Device are determined by your telephone carrier and the version of the operating system your Device is running when Robokiller is set up. If you upgrade your operating system version, it is recommended that you disable/deprogram your Device, uninstall, and reinstall Robokiller to ensure you have the best experience. Instructions on how to disable/re-program Robokiller can be found  in the settings menu of the App.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCall Blocking/Forwarding\u003c/strong\u003e. Activating the call blocking/forwarding feature means that certain incoming calls (e.g. declined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to Robokiller in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call - all before your phone rings). Calls from your Device’s contacts go directly to your Device. When you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNumber Monitoring\u003c/strong\u003e.  You agree to check the numbers and messages from blocked calls on your Device regularly to ensure that you whitelist any legitimate phone number so that it will not be blocked in the future. The Service also provides you the ability to create and modify a personal whitelist (\u0026quot;\u003cstrong\u003eAllow List\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026quot;) and blacklist (\u0026quot;\u003cstrong\u003eBlock List\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026quot;). You can use the whitelist feature to ensure that a specific number is never blocked. You can add or remove users from your personal Allow List and Block List at any time. Please note that if you have requested a call from, or have an existing relationship with a debt relief company, collections company or if you provided your number to authorize a sales call to any company and you desire to continue receiving those calls, we advise you to add the number to your contacts or Allow List and to monitor your Robokiller messages for calls you may wish to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess to Microphone\u003c/strong\u003e.   When you download Robokiller and begin the setup and activation process, Robokiller will ask permission to access your Device’s microphone.
