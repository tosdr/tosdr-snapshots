<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>The Synthesia website and the Synthesia application limit the collection of personally identifiable user data to purposes including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ol>
   <li>To enhance your experience.  Statistical information may be used in a variety of ways to improve the website or the game.</li>
   <li>To solve technical problems.  Log data may be examined in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved code or interactions.</li>
   <li>To monitor website conditions.  We statistically sample raw log data from users' visits and activity to help maintain functionality of the website and related services.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>It is our policy that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database, or through other non-publicly-available methods, may be released in any of the following situations:</p>

<ol>
   <li>In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement,</li>
   <li>With permission of the affected user,</li>
   <li>When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints,</li>
   <li>Where the information pertains to a technical issue and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve it,</li>
   <li>Where the user has been behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to a service provider, carrier, or other third-party entity to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers,</li>
   <li>Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Synthesia LLC, Synthesia, its users or the public.</li>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Warranty</h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and its licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>

<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
