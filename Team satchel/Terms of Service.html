				<p>11.5 The Parties acknowledge that the Charges have been calculated taking into account the recoverability or otherwise of the related input VAT. The Parties agree that if a ruling or appellate body decision or change in HMRC practice results in a VAT liability for all or part of the Services provided herein that differs from these assumptions, to the extent that Satchel’s VAT recovery on costs attributable to the provision of the Services is reduced or improved as a result of the ruling, decision or change in HMRC practise, the charges (exclusive of any VAT) will be increased or reduced (as applicable) with effect from the date that the ruling, decision or change in HMRC practise has effect.</p>

				<p>11.6 Where a change in VAT liability is to be applied retrospectively Satchel shall if appropriate submit a claim to HMRC for a refund of VAT charged in respect of the relevant Services already supplied, less additional VAT due to HMRC as a result of the decrease in Satchel’s input VAT recovery. The amount of VAT refunded to the Customer shall be limited to the amount Satchel receives from HMRC (after taking account of any sums potentially payable to HMRC on account of claims to recover VAT input tax) and the Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Satchel for the costs and expenses incurred in relation thereto less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in or as a consequence of making such claim.</p>

				<p>11.7 Notwithstanding any other right under the Agreement to alter the Charges, Satchel reserves the right to increase the Charges in the event that the Customer’s use of the Services (including but not limited to any significant change which the Customer advises to Satchel it expects to make in the average monthly volume of transmissions of data by use of the Services under Clause 7.4.3) results in a material increase in the level of storage and/or other hosting costs from those reasonably anticipated. Satchel shall give the Customer fair and reasonable notice of seeking to invoke such a ‘fair usage policy’ in order to provide an opportunity to the Customer to return usage to reasonable levels before any increase in Charges shall take effect.</p>

Satchel access may be suspended for overdue payments and Satchel reserves the right to offer or refuse subscriptions for any reason at its sole discretion.</p>

				<p>11.9 Payment Processors</p>

				<p>All financial transactions made in connection with the Service will be processed by a third party in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and/or any applicable payment terms and conditions.

To pay any fee, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (such as credit card, online payment service, a third party, like iTunes or Google Play, or any other payment method made available by Satchel)(Payment Method). If the subscription is through the Google Play or iTunes store then any amendments or cancellations are required to be made through the corresponding store account.</p>
