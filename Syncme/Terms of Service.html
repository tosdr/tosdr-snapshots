Identify unknown phone numbers and block unwanted spam calls.","terms_title":"Terms of use","c1":"Don’t want to share your number on Sync.ME?","c2":"Last modified by December 31, 2014","c3":"Introduction","c4":"Sync.ME (the “Company” or “we”) is a multi-platform social application and global phonebook network, which allows you (“you”, “user” or “users”) to synchronize the information in your contact list with your contacts’ social networks’ profiles, identify callers or perform numeric search (“Caller ID”), perform manual name search and participate in a collaborative mobile community, where you can share your information and your contacts’ information with other users.","c5":"Consent","c6":"This Terms of Use Agreement (the “Agreement”) governs your use of or access to our mobile application and our website, available at: sync.me (collectively, the “Service”).","c7":"By installing, accessing or otherwise using the Service you acknowledge and warrant that you hereby consent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and to the terms of the Privacy Policy (available at: sync.me/privacy), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to any of the terms of this Agreement or of the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Service or any part thereof. If certain features of our Service are subject to additional terms, provisions or guidelines, they are incorporated herein by reference.","c8":"By installing, accessing or otherwise using the Service you hereby allow the Service to access your contacts and all the related information therein for synchronization with your phonebook directory.","c9":"Special features","c10":"The “Caller ID” feature allows you to associate a name with a phone number, whether automatically in an incoming call or manually by a numeric search.","c11":"You may tag a name to a phone number using our “Name Tag” feature. When a sufficient number of users indicated that the phone number is associated with the same name, the name and phone number will be included in our directory.","c12":"You may also report a phone number as SPAM in our directory and block future attempts to contact you from that phone number using our “Call Block” feature. If you decide to block a phone number, the caller will be directed to your voicemail when attempting to contact you. You may also report any number to our SPAM public directory. When a sufficient number of users report a phone number as SPAM, it will be listed in our searchable public directory, which will be periodically updated. You may always withdraw your SPAM report or block request.","c13":"To access or use the “Sync.ME search” you will be required to provide your contacts’ names, phone numbers and email addresses for the Service’s phonebook directory; this will enhance the performance of the Service and allow you to perform numeric search or identify incoming calls against a searchable phonebook directory, which contains the contacts’ information from our users who permitted the aggregation of this information.","c14":"If you chose to activate the “Sync.ME search” feature, you would be asked to explicitly warrant that you have all necessary permissions to share your contacts’ information, and that you have no knowledge of any objection, on the behalf of any of your respected contacts, to include their names and phone numbers in the phonebook directory, which is available for other registered users. Please be sure not to share any other person details without his or her prior consent, and that the information you share is accurate and up-to-date. For security reasons, we will also filter out numbers of your phonebook which do not seem to correlate to an actual person. You may at any time opt-out of this feature by deactivating it, in which case we will de-list your contacts (unless their details were provided by other sources).","c15":"Our “Name search” feature will allow you to request a phone number at a manual name search; the request will only be accommodated it the searched person has made his phone number available for search via the Service, or where his phone number is available on a publicly accessible directory. If that is not the case, the request will be forwarded (by SMS) to the searched person (if permissible), who may choose whether to share with you his number at his or her own discretion, block future requests from you or opt-out of this feature altogether. Your profile information will be visible to that person. Any person may opt-out of this feature, free of charge, by contacting us at: support@sync.me. In any case, no person will receive more than two requests a week. You hereby consent that you may receive such requests, in accordance with the terms stipulated herein.","c16":"Certain features allow you to synchronize your profile information and your contacts’ information with the information contained on your social networks and platforms (Facebook, Google+, VK, LinkedIn, etc.), including information made available by your contacts or friends on such social networks (e.g. birthdays, photos, status, etc.). These features will enhance the performance of our Service and allow you to better integrate and harmonize our Service with your updated profile information and information concerning your friends.","c17":"The Company will abide by the terms and conditions of the social networks and platforms in which you and any relevant contact are registered with a profile, with respect to retrieving accessible information from such networks or platforms (for synchronization or for other purposes), and will follow any configuration, security, privacy or other applicable restrictions of such platforms.","c18":"Grant of license","c19":"Subject to your full compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, we hereby grant you a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, free of charge, license to download, access and use the Service on a device you own or control, for the sole purpose of your personal use of the Service in connection with terms provided herein.","c20":"We are entitled, without any liability, to refuse, restrict, limit, suspend and/or interfere or interrupt the Service or any part thereof, without any notice to you for the repair, improvement, and/or upgrade of the Service or for any of the reasons for termination as mentioned below.","c21":"Eligibility","c22":"You may not access or use the Service if you are under thirteen (13) years of age or if you are legally unable (under the applicable laws and regulations) to enter into this Agreement.
