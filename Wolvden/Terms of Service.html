		</li>
		<li><b>Third party services / advertising / websites</b>
			<ol>

			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Guidance by us</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Any guidance or similar information which we ourselves make available on our Game is intended as very general guidance information but we cannot guarantee that it is accurate or up to date and we do not accept legal responsibility for it.

			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Currency (including Gold Cones and Silver Cones) and Virtual Items</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Payment for any chargeable features of our Game (currently GC) must be made in advance. The prices shown on our website include VAT unless we say otherwise. We may at any time change the price payable for future GC or other purchases.</li>
				<li>It is your responsibility to check that Currency and Virtual Items have been correctly credited to your account and to tell us immediately if not. You must contact us immediately with full details if you dispute any payment.</li>
				<li>We do not provide any refunds for chargeable Currency or Virtual Items except where we specifically say otherwise in these Terms of Service or you have a legal right to a refund.</li>

				<li>We may restrict access to or delete Currency and Virtual Items if they were awarded in error or if a payment is charged back.</li>
				<li>Currency and Virtual Items can only be used within the Game and have no inherent value.</li>
				<li>We can at any time change how Currency or Virtual Items may be used; for example how much Currency is needed to acquire a Virtual Item.</li>
				<li>See further restrictions on dealings with Currency and Virtual Items in the <a href="/code">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
				<li>Currency and Virtual Items will be deleted when this agreement ends.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Discount codes</b>
			<ol>
				<li>We may offer discount codes from time to time. Such codes may only be applied to purchases made through the account in respect of which the discount code was offered and registered and are not transferrable or redeemable for cash. Unless otherwise stated: codes (1) are only available for future new orders placed online; (2) cannot be used retrospectively; (3) can only be redeemed once per customer; and (4) expire after 12 months. You cannot use more than one discount code per transaction unless we state otherwise; if we do so, the order in which the codes are to be applied is in our sole discretion.</li>
				<li>We reserve the right to reject any discount code if we consider that it is being used in breach of these terms. Discount codes are subject to any additional specific Terms of Service which are specified at the point of issue.  We reserve the right to discontinue or otherwise modify any discount codes at any time without prior notice.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Ending or suspending this contract</b>
			<ol>
				<li>You may at any time end this contract without refund by closing your account in accordance with the instructions within the Game. (Ending the contract doesn't entitle you to a refund unless you have Consumer "cooling off" rights, explained below.)</li>
				<li>We are entitled at any time to end this contract without refund if we terminate our Game as a whole.</li>
				<li>We are entitled at any time (with or without notice) to end this contract (including permanently banning an account) or suspend part or all of our Game (including suspending an account or removal of certain account privileges) if we have reason to believe that you have breached our Terms of Service or if any payment is charged back or if it is necessary to protect us or others or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority. There will be no refund.</li>
				<li>If this contract ends: Your right to use our Game and all licences are terminated. Currency, Virtual Items and scores associated with the account will be deleted. Existing rights and liabilities are unaffected. All clauses in this contract which are stated or intended to continue after termination will continue to apply. You must not attempt to re-register for or continue to use our Game if we have given you notice of termination.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Right to cancel ("cooling off")</b>
			<ol>
				<li>If you live in the "European Economic Area", you have the right to cancel this contract subject to the provisions set out below.  However, you lose the right to cancel where the supply of digital content began before the end of cancellation period with your specific agreement and you acknowledged that your right to cancel would be lost in such case.</li>
				<li>If you do have the right to cancel, the following apply:</li>

				<br><i>Right to cancel</i>
				<li>You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.</li>
				<li>The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract (i.e. when you first registered with us).</li>
