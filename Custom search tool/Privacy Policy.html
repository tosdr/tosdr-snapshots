		<hr>
		
		<p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Collect Call, LLC d/b/a Pesology ("Pesology") collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from its customers and users of its Website (each, a "User").

		<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Pesology does not own or control, 

or to people that Pesology does not employ or manage. This includes any companies from whom 

you may have ordered services or products that are transmitted over Pesology's mobile or billing 

platform, and any companies from whom you may be purchasing other services.</p>

		<p>Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your device and hardware IDs and device type, the request type, your carrier, your carrier user ID, the content of your request, and basic usage stats about your device and use of Pesology's products and services does not by itself identify you to Pesology, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.</p>

		<p>Certain of our products and services allow you to download and/or personalize the content you receive from us. For these products and services, we will record information about your downloads and preferences, along with any information you provide yourself.</p>
		
		<p>For products and services with voice recognition capabilities, we collect and store a copy of the voice commands you make to the product or service.

This recording stays only temporarily on the device and is not sent to Pesology.</p>
