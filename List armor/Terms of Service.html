      <li>  Service Packages.  Our service packages are as described at the time of signup on the Plans &amp; Pricing page. Any changes to the services offering doesn't affect your account, as whatever options you had available to you on signup are grandfathered in. We offer a free initial trial to all subscribers when they first sign up to use our Services.  We accept all major credit cards for payment.  All payments are non-refundable. </li> 
      <li>  Subscription Period:  Subscriptions commence 14 days after you first sign up for our Services and expire 30 days thereafter.  Upon expiration, you may renew for successive, additional monthly periods ("Renewal Periods") upon the payment of the applicable subscription fee. </li>

      <li> Compliance after cancellation.  The Company is not responsible for lapses in CAN-SPAM compliance after the account is cancelled.  Opt-out pages must be available for at least 30 days after any message is sent.  Therefore we cannot guarantee compliance if the account is closed before this period ends.

      <li>  Upgrades.  In the event you upgrade your service package at any time, your upgraded service package will be effective immediately but you will not be billed the applicable service fee for the upgraded package until the commencement of your new subscription period.  </li>
      <li>  Uploaded Content.  You may upload to your account such content as email suppression lists, logos, and text ("Content"). We agree that you or your licensors will retain all right, title, and interest in the Content that you upload to your account.

      <li>  Trial Period.  You are welcome to take advantage of a free 14-day trial of our software.</li>
      <li>  Use of Service during trial peroid.  The CAN-SPAM act requires unsubscribe pages to be available for at least 30 days after a message is sent.  Therefore The Service cannot be used for live email campaigns during the 14-day trial period unless you plan to pay for at least one month of service after the email messages are sent.
