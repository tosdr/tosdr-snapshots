If <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> chooses to intervene or take action in any dispute between a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> or between Creators, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> agree that Roblox’s decision (which may include deducting <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> from the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> and crediting <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> to the <span class="tooltip user">User</span>) is final, and <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> and <span class="tooltip user">User</span> will accept that decision. Users and Creators agree to work with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> in a timely manner to resolve all such issues, and failure to do so shall be a violation of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>.</li>

<summary class="blurb-heading">Dispute Resolution (Between User and Roblox); Arbitration Agreement; Class Action Waiver.</summary>
<div>
<p>Except as otherwise permitted in the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy you may have with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> arising under or relating in any way to the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> or the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> (“<strong><span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span></strong>”) will be governed and resolved through the Mandatory Informal <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> Resolution (“<strong><span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span></strong>”) process (as outlined below).</p>
<p><strong>FOR U.S. RESIDENTS ONLY:</strong> If the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process has been completed but the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> remains unresolved, you agree that such <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> will be determined through binding arbitration (as outlined below) and not through litigation. This agreement applies regardless of the legal theories involved in the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> and regardless of whether the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> is with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, its subsidiaries, affiliates or parent company, or any suppliers or service providers involved with the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>, or their officers, directors, employees, agents, or successors. <strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION, FOR ANY DISPUTES SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISION BELOW.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Mandatory Informal <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> Resolution.</strong> We hope there’s never a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> between us. but if there is, we both recognize and agree that good faith, informal efforts to resolve Disputes often result in prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcomes. Therefore, we each agree that—before either of us may commence an arbitration or assert any claim in court, except as set forth in Section 11.a.vi, below—we will engage in the following <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process:<br />
<ol type="i">
<li>Notice. To initiate the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process, the party with a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> must first give written notice to the other party.<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>To notify <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span></strong>, you must send written notice to <strong>Roblox Corporation, Legal Department, 970 Park Place, Suite 100, San Mateo, CA 94403</strong> by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (or international equivalent), providing: (a) the User’s full name, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> username, and any email or billing address associated with the User’s <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> <span class="tooltip account">Account</span>; (b) the name and contact information of the User’s counsel, if <span class="tooltip user">User</span> is represented by counsel; (c) a brief description of the User’s <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> and the resolution requested; and (d) the ticket or case number provided by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> Support to track previous attempts to resolve the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>, if there is one.</li>
<li><strong>To notify a <span class="tooltip user">User</span></strong>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will send a written notice to the email address or billing address that you provided to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> (or, if none is provided, through the messaging system on the <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> Service); that notice will include (a) the name and contact information of Roblox’s counsel; and (b) a brief description of Roblox’s <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> and the resolution requested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process. Both parties will then engage in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process. The <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process requires conferring in writing—or, if requested by either party, via teleconference or videoconference—in a good faith effort to informally resolve the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>. If either party is represented by counsel, that counsel may participate.</li>
<li>Confidentiality. All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process.</li>
<li>Timing. The <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process shall occur within sixty (60) days of receipt of the written notice described in subsection i above, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. However, if a party is seeking injunctive relief on an emergency basis (for example, a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order), the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process with respect to that relief shall occur within three (3) business days of receipt of the written notice described in subsection i above, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process described in this section.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> Is a Mandatory Prerequisite to Arbitration or Litigation. If, after participating in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process, we have been unable to resolve the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>, either party may commence an arbitration (or litigation, if the claim falls within an exception to the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> (as defined below)). However, if we have not engaged in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process as set forth in this section, the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> may not be submitted to arbitration, nor may a claim be filed in court, until the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process occurs. <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> understand and agree that any <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> that has not first been subject to <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span>:
<ul>
<li>Shall not be accepted by the arbitration provider, and shall be deemed frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b); further, the arbitrator may allocate any arbitration fees and/or costs to any party that files a frivolous claim in violation of this Section 11.a; and</li>
<li>Shall be subject to dismissal if asserted in court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceptions. If a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> involves a claim that asserts infringement of patent, copyright, trademark, or <span class="tooltip trade">trade</span> secret rights, the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> are not required to participate in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process set forth in this section.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span>.</strong> <strong>THE FOLLOWING APPLIES TO U.S. USERS ONLY.</strong> If there is a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> between us, and we’re unable to resolve it through the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process described in subsection a. above, this subsection explains in detail the process for resolving that <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>. <strong>Please read this section carefully; it’s important.</strong>
<ol type="i">
<li><span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</span> AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE <strong><span class="tooltip roblox_terms">ROBLOX TERMS</span></strong>, <strong><span class="tooltip user">USER</span></strong> AND <strong><span class="tooltip roblox">ROBLOX</span></strong> AGREE THAT ANY <span class="tooltip dispute">DISPUTE</span> THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED THROUGH <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> , WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH HEREIN, RATHER THAN IN COURT. <span class="tooltip user">USER</span> AND <span class="tooltip roblox">ROBLOX</span> THEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT <strong>USER</strong> AND <strong>ROBLOX</strong> MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.<br />
<p>This arbitration agreement and class action waiver (“<strong><span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span></strong>”) applies to all Users who are United States residents and, except as provided below, to all Disputes—regardless of (a) the legal theories involved in the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>, (b) when the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> arose, and (c) whether the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> is with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, with Roblox’s subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent company, or with any suppliers or service providers involved with the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> (including any officers, directors, employees, agents, or successors).</p>
</li>
<li>Federal Arbitration Act; Interpretation; and Enforcement. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) (“<strong><span class="tooltip FAA">FAA</span></strong>”), including its procedural provisions, in all respects. This means that the <span class="tooltip FAA">FAA</span> governs, among other things, the interpretation and enforcement of this <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> and all of its provisions, including, without limitation, the class action waiver. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect. Further, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> each agree that the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and construed in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible.</li>
<li>Arbitration Generally; Relief Available. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited pursuant to the <span class="tooltip FAA">FAA</span>. However, an arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief and statutory damages) and must follow the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award public injunctive relief if authorized by law and warranted by the individual claim(s).</li>
<li>Arbitration Proceedings and Rules. Arbitrations will be administered by <span class="tooltip FedArb">FedArb</span> in accordance with FedArb’s Expedited Arbitration Rules and (if applicable) Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, except as modified by the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>. In particular, the Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL shall apply if five or more demands for arbitration are filed that share common factual or legal issues, and if counsel for the parties submitting those demands are the same or coordinated. Users can find more information at <a href="www.fedarb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.fedarb.com</a> or by calling 1-650-328-9500.<br />
<p>Unless required by law, or unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearing—including oral arguments—will be conducted through video conferencing. If the arbitration hearing is conducted in person, it will take place in San Mateo County, California, if that is a convenient location for the <span class="tooltip user">User</span>, or the county or parish where the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> resides.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator will issue a written decision explaining the findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s decision is based.</p>
<p>Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the arbitration proceeding and all records pertaining to it—including but not limited to any documents prepared or produced in connection with the arbitration proceeding, as well as the hearing, the decision, and the arbitration award—will be confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>
</li>
<li>Commencing an Arbitration. A party who has complied with the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process described above and who wishes to start arbitration must submit a demand for arbitration and a copy of the <span class="tooltip user_terms">User Terms</span> to <span class="tooltip FedArb">FedArb</span> at <a href="https://fedarb.my.salesforce-sites.com/Roblox_DemandForm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fedarb.my.salesforce-sites.com/Roblox_DemandForm</a>.</li>
<li>Fees and Costs. If you commence an arbitration in accordance with the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> and <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span>, you will be required to pay the first $50 of FedArb’s filing fee. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 11(a)(v) and this subsection, you will not be responsible for paying any other fees for the arbitration other than the filing fee; all other fees or expenses charged by <span class="tooltip FedArb">FedArb</span> will be paid by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>. Further, if <span class="tooltip FedArb">FedArb</span> determines that you are unable to pay any part of the filing fee, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will pay that part too.<br />
<p>Users are otherwise responsible for their own costs and attorneys’ fees; <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will not pay such costs or attorneys’ fees unless ordered to do so by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the parties agree that the arbitrator may order the losing party to reimburse the prevailing party for all arbitration fees—as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Further, in cases where a statute authorizes the award of attorneys’ fees or costs to the prevailing party, the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees or costs pursuant to that statute.</p>
<p>The parties agree that <span class="tooltip FedArb">FedArb</span> has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any fees due under any applicable rules or fee schedules, and further agree not to oppose any modifications to the timing or amount of any fees due—provided that such modifications do not increase the fees to either party.</p>
</li>
<li>Delegation; Interpretation. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> is void or voidable; however, in the event of a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> about which particular version of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> you agreed to, a court will decide that specific question prior to the commencement of the arbitration. This <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> is intended to be broadly interpreted and will survive termination of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>.</li>
<li>Severability. If any provision of this <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> is found unenforceable, that provision will be severed, and the balance of the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> will remain in full force and effect. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of this <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> as to any particular claim, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration, while the remaining claims will still be resolved through binding arbitration.</li>
<li>Opting Out. You may opt-out of the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> entirely and litigate any <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> with us by sending written notice to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> within 30 days of signing up for the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> for the first time. Thereafter, you may only opt-out of material changes to the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> by sending written notice within 30 days after <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> provides notice of those changes (unless a longer period is required by applicable law). In either case, to opt-out, a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> must send a written notice entitled “Arbitration Opt-Out Notice” to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> Corporation, Legal Department, 970 Park Place, Suite 100, San Mateo, CA 94403 by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (or international equivalent). To be valid, the opt-out notice must be sent to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> from the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> who wants to opt-out (or that User’s guardian) and include (a) the User’s full name, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> username, and email address, (b) a clear statement that the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> wants to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement, or wants to opt-out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, as applicable, and (c) the User’s signature (or the signature of the User’s guardian, if the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> is a <span class="tooltip minor">Minor</span>). If opting-out of a material change, the notice must also identify the particular material change to which the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> wants to opt-out. An opt-out notice applies only to the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span>; all other parts of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> will still apply to the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>. Further, an opt-out notice does not revoke or otherwise affect any previous agreement to the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span>. By opting out of a material change to the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span>, you agree to arbitrate any <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> in accordance with the language of the last version of the <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> that you accepted.</li>
<li>Exceptions. The <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> shall be subject to the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>Users and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> retain the right to participate in class-wide settlement of claims.</li>
<li>The <span class="tooltip arbitration_agreement">Arbitration Agreement</span> does not apply to Users who are not residents of the United States, or to Users who (pursuant to subsection ix above) properly opt-out of the entire Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of signing up for the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> for the first time.</li>
<li>If a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> is within the jurisdiction of small claims court, either the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> or <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may (after engaging in the <span class="tooltip MIDR">MIDR</span> process) choose to take the <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> to small claims court in the User’s county of residence, or in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.</li>
<li>If a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span> involves a claim that asserts infringement of patent, copyright, trademark, or <span class="tooltip trade">trade</span> secret rights, either the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> or <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may assert the claim in federal or state court, as set forth in Section 15.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Timing for Raising Disputes.</strong> <span class="tooltip user">USER</span> AND ROBLOX AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE <span class="tooltip services">SERVICES</span> MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES OR IT IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</li>

<p><span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> retains the right to delete or update any or all content within an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> at any time and at Creator’s discretion (and <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> will delete or update such content if required by law), provided that regardless of any such update or deletion having occurred, and regardless of any termination of these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span> or termination or suspension of Creator’s <span class="tooltip account">Account</span>: (i) <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> created by <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> which was validly purchased or otherwise validly obtained by a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> may continue to be accessed and used by such <span class="tooltip user">User</span> indefinitely (or, in the case of <span class="tooltip ugc_subscription">UGC Subscriptions</span>, for the duration of the purchased subscription period) in accordance with and subject to the terms and policies of the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>; and, (ii) Roblox’s right to use any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> or other content that is already in use by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> pursuant to a license or otherwise in accordance with these <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> or already in use by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> as part of an <span class="tooltip ancillary_use">Ancillary Use</span> shall continue in perpetuity.</p>
<p>In addition to Roblox’s right to grant sublicenses for Creator’s <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>, when Publishing certain <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> onto the Service, may be asked if <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> would like to share such <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> directly with other Users. <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> is not required to do so, but if <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> does agree to grant this right, then other Users may use Creator's <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> to create their own Experiences and other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> without any further obligation to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>.</p>
<p>Where Creator’s <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> is sold or otherwise provided to a <span class="tooltip user">User</span>, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> agrees that, pursuant to the rights granted to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> herein and regardless of whether the <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> was sold or provided by <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> to the <span class="tooltip user">User</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may allow the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> to continue to access and use such <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> indefinitely (in accordance with and subject to the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>) even if the <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> is no longer otherwise accessible on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>.</p>
<p>Roblox’s rights under this <span class="tooltip ugc_license">UGC License</span> shall expressly survive if Creator's <span class="tooltip account">Account</span> is terminated due to Creator's breach or violation of these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span> or any of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>Through-to-the-Audience Rights. The rights <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> grants in these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span> are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third-party services won’t have separate liability to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> or anyone else for <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> that <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> has made available on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> or used on <span class="tooltip third-party_services">Third-Party Services</span> via Roblox’s <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>.</li>
<li>Authorization to <span class="tooltip publish">Publish</span> <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> to <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> must not <span class="tooltip publish">Publish</span> or otherwise make any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> available on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> if <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> is not the owner of or is not fully authorized to grant rights in all parts of that <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>. Without limiting Creator’s obligations under Section 9 of these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span> (and all other obligations set forth in the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>), <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> agrees to pay all amounts owed to any person as a result of <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> Publishing or making <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> available on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>.</li>
<li>Suspension of <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> Availability. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may, in its sole discretion, suspend availability of or delete any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> or other content on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> at any time and for any period of time, including in perpetuity, without notice if such <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> or other content violates any laws or intellectual property rights or principles or any guidelines or policies associated with the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> or if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> determines in its sole discretion that such <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> does or may cause harm to Users, the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>, or to Roblox’s reputation. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> is and shall be under no obligation of any kind to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> for suspending any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> in accordance with this Section.</li>
<li>Limitations on Use of <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>. Notwithstanding Creator’s ownership of <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> (other than Modified Classic Avatars and the right to apply <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> and other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> to Classic Avatars and Modified Classic Avatars) as set forth above and without limiting any other limitations set forth herein, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> shall in no event use Creator’s <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> (in any medium or format, including on or off the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>): (a) in a manner that is offensive, defamatory, sexually explicit, or otherwise objectionable (in each case, as determined by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> in its sole discretion);&nbsp; (b) in connection with false, defamatory, libelous or slanderous statements concerning <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>; or (c) in a manner that is intended or reasonably likely to suggest or imply that <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> is affiliated with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> or that <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> endorses <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> or its use of the applicable <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>.</li>
<li>Infringement and DMCA. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> fosters creativity and respects the intellectual property rights of others, including Creators. Any copyright owner or an agent of a copyright or trademark owner (including other Creators who are owners or agents of a copyright or trademark owner) who believes that any content on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> (including <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>) infringes upon its copyrights or trademarks may submit a notification pursuant to the reporting process outlined in Section 6.d. of the <span class="tooltip user_terms">User Terms</span>. As referred to throughout the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, in appropriate circumstances, may terminate the Accounts of Users (or Creators) who <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> determines, in its sole discretion, are repeat infringers as contemplated by the DMCA.</li>

<li><strong>Definitions.</strong><br />
<ol type="i">
<li><span class="tooltip group">Group</span>. For purposes of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, a "<strong><span class="tooltip group">Group</span></strong>" exists where Creators have joined together and, via a single email address, registered on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> as a single unit for the purpose of releasing an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or other <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> through the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. For corporate accounts, the company (or other legal entity) named on the account is considered a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span>. Each <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> must select an “<strong><span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span></strong>,” who shall be the individual or entity that controls the email address used to register the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>, to act on behalf of the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>. The <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span>, in its sole discretion, may choose to transfer ownership of the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> at any time to a new owner; provided, however, that only one individual or entity may be the <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> of a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> at a time. If an Owner’s account is terminated pursuant to these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span>, the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, or other applicable <span class="tooltip additional_terms">Additional Terms</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may, in its sole discretion, designate another <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> of the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>; provided, however, that nothing will obligate <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> to do so if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, in its sole discretion, determines to terminate a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Rights and Authority.</strong> By participating in a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>, each <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> grants the <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> (as such <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> may change over time) the sole and exclusive authority to act on their behalf to (i) authorize Roblox’s use of any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> created by the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> as set forth in these <span class="tooltip creator_terms">Creator Terms</span> or pursuant to any other agreement entered into between the <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>; and (ii) receive payment for any activities undertaken or <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> sold by the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> on or through the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> members hereby waive any claims they may have against <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> for any payments made to an <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> on behalf of the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>, and <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> members agree to seek recovery of any such payments solely from the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span>. The authority granted to a Group’s <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> may be modified by separate agreement amongst <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> members. Except as may be provided at law, any duty of accounting between a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> <span class="tooltip owner">Owner</span> and <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> members will arise solely pursuant to a written agreement among the <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>, and <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will not be bound by any such agreement.</li>

<li>Earning <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span>. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> allows Creators to earn <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> (“ <span class="tooltip earned_robux">Earned Robux</span>”) by selling or monetizing certain <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> (including <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> and access to Experiences) they create on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. <span class="tooltip earned_robux">Earned Robux</span> consist only of those <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> that a <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> has received from (a) the direct sale, (b) other monetization, or (c) Engagement Based Payouts (“<strong><span class="tooltip EBP">EBP</span></strong>” or “<strong>Premium Payouts</strong>”) of <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> it created (either alone or with a <span class="tooltip group">Group</span>) on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> in compliance with the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> and any applicable <span class="tooltip additional_terms">Additional Terms</span>. <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> acquired in other ways (such as via a stipend through a <span class="tooltip roblox_premium">Roblox Premium</span> membership, referral bonus, purchase of a gift card, or by trading/selling <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> that you did not create) are not <span class="tooltip earned_robux">Earned Robux</span>. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may remove any <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> earned through a violation of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> or any applicable <span class="tooltip additional_terms">Additional Terms</span>.

<li><strong>Selling <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span></strong>. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> allows Creators to sell (i) access to Experiences; (ii) <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span> and (iii) other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> they create on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>, subject to the following:
<ol type="i">
<li><span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span> Roles: There are three roles involved in the sale of all <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> (except 2D <span class="tooltip virtual_items">Virtual Items</span> (also known as “<strong><span class="tooltip classic_clothing">Classic Clothing</span></strong>”)) on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. Each role may be entitled to a share of the <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> generated from an applicable sale (“<strong><span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span></strong>”):<br />
<ul>
<li><span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>: The <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> is the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> or <span class="tooltip group">Group</span> that created the <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> being sold.</li>
<li>Seller/Distributor: The Distributor is (i) the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> (if the item is sold in an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> also created); (ii) another <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> (if the item is sold in an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> did not create); or (iii) <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> (if the item is sold in Marketplace).</li>
<li>Platform: The Platform is always <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>.
<p>The above <span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span> does not apply to the sale of <span class="tooltip classic_clothing">Classic Clothing</span>, which consists of pants, shirts, and T-shirts. For any <span class="tooltip classic_clothing">Classic Clothing</span> sold in Marketplace, the <span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span> is split between the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> and the Platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes to <span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span>. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may, at any time upon notice to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> (via any reasonable means), (a) change the <span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span> and/or (b) introduce features allowing certain elements of the <span class="tooltip robux_allocation">Robux Allocation</span> to be customized by those involved in a given sale.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> Responsibility for Sales on <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> acknowledges that <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may on Creator’s behalf, display and host Experiences, <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span>, or other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> created by <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> to be enjoyed by other Users on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. When a <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> receives <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> in connection with&nbsp;the sale of <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> to a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> through the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>, the transaction is between the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> and the <span class="tooltip user">User</span>; <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> only facilitates by providing the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. If, in connection with a <span class="tooltip dispute">Dispute</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> returns <span class="tooltip robux">Robux or real money</span> to a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> (or another <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>) for any <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> for which a <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> received <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> reserves the right to deduct or withhold an equivalent amount of <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> from such <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>.</li>
<li>Random <span class="tooltip virtual_items">Virtual Items</span>. Depending on <span class="tooltip user">User</span> location, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> may choose to provide Experiences that permit Users to acquire “random” <span class="tooltip virtual_items">Virtual Items</span> (either with <span class="tooltip robux">Robux</span> or otherwise) (each, a “<strong><span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span></strong>”). If a <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> provides the opportunity for a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> to receive a <span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span>, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> must let Users know the odds of acquiring each type of <span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span> available before a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> engages in the transaction to acquire a <span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span>.<br />By way of example only, if a Creator’s <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> allows a <span class="tooltip user">User</span> to acquire a virtual marble that the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> can then throw into a fountain to receive a <span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span>, the <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> must disclose the odds of the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> receiving each type of <span class="tooltip random_virtual_item">Random Virtual Item</span> before the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> throws the marble into the fountain.</li>

</li>
<li><strong><span class="tooltip developer">Developer</span> Exchange Program.</strong> <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> allows certain Creators who satisfy specific criteria to participate in the <span class="tooltip developer">Developer</span> Exchange Program (“<strong><span class="tooltip devex_program">DevEx Program</span></strong>”). Subject to certain requirements, policies and limitations that <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> establishes in its sole discretion, Creators participating in the <span class="tooltip devex_program">DevEx Program</span> may exchange <span class="tooltip earned_robux">Earned Robux</span> for real currency based on an exchange rate determined by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, in its sole discretion (the exchange rate and the general requirements, policies, and limitations of the <span class="tooltip devex_program">DevEx Program</span> are published <a href="https://www.roblox.com/developer-exchange/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (“<strong><span class="tooltip devex_terms">DevEx Terms</span></strong>”).</li>
<li><strong><span class="tooltip EBP">EBP</span> or Premium Payouts.</strong> <span class="tooltip EBP">EBP</span> or Premium Payouts is a program by which certain eligible Creators can generate additional <span class="tooltip earned_robux">Earned Robux</span> based on how engaging their <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> is. The <span class="tooltip EBP">EBP</span> or Premium Payouts program may be modified or terminated by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> at any time, in its sole discretion, and with no obligation to any Creators because of such termination or modification. More detailed information on the <span class="tooltip EBP">EBP</span> Program may be found <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/premium-payouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer.</strong> Developing Experiences or <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> that Users will enjoy or spend time in is difficult and can take a lot of time. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> makes no promises that a Creator's <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> will be successful in developing a large audience or that the time, effort, and expense that a <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> spends developing, advertising, or operating an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> will be financially successful.</li>

<li><strong><span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span>.</strong> <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may choose to make sound recordings and the musical works contained therein as well as sound effects (“<strong><span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span></strong>”) available for <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> to use in Creator’s Experiences or other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>. Creator’s use of the <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> is subject to the following:
<ol type="i">
<li>License. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> grants <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> (i) a non-exclusive, personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license only to synchronize <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> into an <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> (“<strong><span class="tooltip ugc_with_licensed_music">UGC With Licensed Music</span></strong>”), solely by and through the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> and only during the period when <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> makes such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> available; and (ii) the right to play, listen, and interact with <span class="tooltip ugc_with_licensed_music">UGC With Licensed Music</span>, but only on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> and only during the period when <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> makes such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> available. <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> is not required to provide attribution for <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> used by <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> in any <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span>, but <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> may do so at Creator’s discretion. For example, if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> identifies the owner of <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> as APM Music, <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> can message that the <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> is provided “Courtesy of APM Music.”</li>
<li>Revocation (Loss) of License. As Licensed Music is licensed by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> from third parties, Creator’s rights to use <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> is revocable at any time and for any or no reason, in Roblox’s sole discretion, without any liability to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>. If <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> revokes Creator’s right to use <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> (for any reason), <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> agrees to immediately (a) remove such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> from Creator’s <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or other <span class="tooltip ugc">UGC</span> and (b) cease all use of such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> on the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span>. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will try to provide <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span> with advance notice before revoking any usage rights to <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span>, but <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> reserves the right to do so with no advance notice. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> further reserves the right to remove any <span class="tooltip experience">Experience</span> or other <span class="tooltip ugc_with_licensed_music">UGC With Licensed Music</span> from the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> at any time, in its sole discretion, and without any liability to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>. Additionally, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> can revoke Creator’s rights to all or part of the <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> (with or without notice) without any liability to <span class="tooltip creator">Creator</span>, (x) if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> determines that Creator’s use of such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> may violate any <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span>, guidelines, or policies; (y) if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> otherwise determines that such <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> may harm the <span class="tooltip services">Services</span> or Roblox’s reputation; or (z) if the <span class="tooltip licensed_music">Licensed Music</span> is no longer available for distribution on the Service.</li>

<summary class="blurb-heading">Right of withdrawal</summary>
<div>If <span class="tooltip user">User</span> is a consumer (i.e. an individual who, in contracting with <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>, is acting for purposes which are outside User’s trade, business, craft or profession), <span class="tooltip user">User</span> may revoke all concluded contracts under the following conditions<br />
<ol type="A">
<li>Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal<br />
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Right of withdrawal.</strong> Subject to Section 13D, below, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> has the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of this contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> must inform <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> (Roblox Corporation, Customer Support, 970 Park Place, Suite 100, San Mateo, CA 94403, or (888) 858-2569) of User’s decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post). <span class="tooltip user">User</span> may use the below-referenced model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model withdrawal form or any other unequivocal statement on our website through our <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Support Form</a>. If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by letter) without delay.
<p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for <span class="tooltip user">User</span> to send User’s communication concerning User’s exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Effects of withdrawal.</strong> If <span class="tooltip user">User</span> withdraws from this contract, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> shall reimburse to <span class="tooltip user">User</span> all payments received from <span class="tooltip user">User</span>, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from User’s choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> is informed about User’s decision to withdraw from this contract. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as <span class="tooltip user">User</span> used for the initial transaction, unless <span class="tooltip user">User</span> has expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
<p>If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated with us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Model withdrawal form
<p>(complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the contract)</p>
<p>To Roblox Corporation, Customer Support, 970 Park Place, Suite 100, San Mateo, CA 94403.</p>
<p>- I/We(*) hereby give notice that I/We(*) withdraw from my/our(*) contract of sale of the following goods (*)/for the provision of the following service(*),<br />- Ordered on(*)/received on(*)<br />- Name of consumer(s)<br />- Address of consumer(s)</p>
<p>- Signature of consumer(s) (only if this form is notified on paper)<br />- Date</p>
<p>____<br />(*) Delete as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions from the right of withdrawal.</strong> The right to withdrawal may not exist in respect of distance or off-premise contracts for the supply of goods made to User’s specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
<li><strong>Expiry of the right of withdrawal.</strong> Please note that the right of withdrawal expires, in the cases of:
<ol>
<li>service contracts after the service has been fully performed but, if the contract places the <span class="tooltip user">User</span> under an obligation to pay, only if the performance has begun with User’s prior express consent and acknowledgement that <span class="tooltip user">User</span> will lose their right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed by <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>.</li>
<li>contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun and, if the contract places <span class="tooltip user">User</span> under an obligation to pay, where, (i) <span class="tooltip user">User</span> has provided prior express consent to begin the performance during the right of withdrawal period; (ii) <span class="tooltip user">User</span> has provided acknowledgement that <span class="tooltip user">User</span> thereby loses User’s right of withdrawal; and (iii) <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> has provided <span class="tooltip user">User</span> with confirmation of the contract, which also states User’s consent to <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> commencing performance of the contract before the expiry of the withdrawal period and confirmation of acknowledgement about the expiry of the right of withdrawal.</li>

<div>In addition to Section 2(g) of the <span class="tooltip user_terms">User Terms</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may refuse to process (i) appeals or (ii) illegal content notices submitted by Users or non-Users that repeatedly or egregiously misuse Roblox’s appeal system or illegal content notice form. Examples of such misuse include frequently providing unsubstantiated notices or appeals, or abusive use of the appeals or notice system including submitting a high volume of appeals or notices without any information. Such refusals may take into consideration e.g. User’s historic use of the appeal system or illegal content notice form and the severity of the misuse. Refusal durations may vary depending on the degree of the violation. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> may also suspend or terminate the accounts of Users who repeatedly publish illegal content. Such suspensions and terminations may take into consideration e.g. User’s historic content violations and the severity of the misuse. Suspension durations may vary depending on the degree of the violation. <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> will notify you in advance of a suspension or termination, unless it is not appropriate for us to do so, and if you disagree with such action, you have the opportunity to appeal.</div>

<summary class="blurb-heading">Recommendations and Ranking of Virtual Content</summary>
<div>Depending on the <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> feature (e.g. features like the Marketplace versus Experience Search), <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> uses different factors in order to provide Users and Creators the most relevant search results and recommendations. The category of factors and relative importance applied to each of them varies depending on the applicable search or recommendation feature. Furthermore, for some features, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> provides Users and Creators the option to modify the order of results or recommendations that are presented, which can be found in close proximity to the search or recommendation feature. See <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/21416941036564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more information about how recommendations and ranking work on <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span>.</div>

<summary class="blurb-heading">Notification and Appeal</summary>
<div>In addition to Section 2(f) of the <span class="tooltip user_terms">User Terms</span>, whenever <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> restricts access to <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span>, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> notifies <span class="tooltip user">User</span> of such decisions and provides <span class="tooltip user">User</span> with an opportunity to appeal. In addition to considering the violation at hand when applying making such decisions, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> also considers User’s historical use of <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> and whether <span class="tooltip user">User</span> has repeatedly violated <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> policies. Continued violations of certain policies may result in a stricter consequence (i.e., a warning, followed by a timeout, followed by a suspension, etc.). E.U. Users may appeal such decisions for up to 6 months after Roblox’s initial decision. When reviewing an appeal request, <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> holistically considers the severity of the violation, User's reason for appealing, and User’s behavior on the platform. Please note, in some circumstances, appeals may not be readily applicable — for example, a time-lapsed consequence such as a 20-minute timeout where the suspension has already been lifted. Where provided for by local laws, <span class="tooltip user">User</span> may have the right to bring a claim for breach of contract against <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> if <span class="tooltip roblox">Roblox</span> restricts access to your <span class="tooltip virtual_content">Virtual Content</span>, or suspends or terminates your account, in breach of the <span class="tooltip roblox_terms">Roblox Terms</span> and these supplemental provisions.</div>
