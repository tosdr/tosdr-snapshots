<div class="subheading">The use of services from UnifiedLayers.com, constitutes agreement to these terms. You may view our Privacy Policy here.<br />
&nbsp;
<p></p>

<h3>1.) Account Setup / Email on file</h3>

<p></p>

<p>We will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) in case of fraud and Address proof and ID proof document for verification. It is your responsibility to provide us with an email address which is not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. If you have a domain name registered with UnifiedLayers.com, it is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your domain account and your actual domain name(s) is correct and up-to-date. UnifiedLayers.com is not responsible for a lapsed registration due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain. If you need to verify or change this information, you should contact our sales team via email. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the purchase. If you fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in nature and be denied.</p>

<p></p>

<br>
<strong>Personal ID verification</strong>

<p>Our compliance department requires additional information regarding your account. Personal ID verification is compulsory for new customers to activate the first order. Please log in to the client area of your account to provide the requested information, which may include any of the following ID: Full name Address Date of Birth Place of Birth Citizenship Nationality Scanned copy of your passport (or similar valid ID) Voter ID Driving Licence Any national ID issued by the government After receiving a scanned copy of the verification id document we will start provisioning your first order.</p>

<h3>Transfers</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Our transfers team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we cannot make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The free transfer services are available for 7 days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the 7 day free period will incur a charge; please contact a member of the transfers department with specific details to receive a price quote.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>2.) Content</h3>

Any account found to be in violation of another&#39;s copyright will be expeditiously removed, or access to the material disabled. Any account found to be in repeated violation of copyright laws will be suspended and/or terminated from our hosting. If you believe that your copyright or trademark is being infringed upon, please email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfd6d1d9d0ffead1d6d9d6dadbf3dec6dacdcc91dcd0d2">[email&#160;protected]</a> with the information required.

<h3>Mailer Pro</h3>

<p></p>

<p>UnifiedLayers.com services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. UnifiedLayers.com systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including to ensure that use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. Use of UnifiedLayers.com system(s) constitutes consent to monitoring for these purposes.</p>
Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control must be with expressed written consent from the third party. UnifiedLayers.com may, at its discretion, request and require documentation to prove access to a third party network or system is authorized.

<p></p>
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Any material that, in our judgment, is obscene, threatening, illegal, or violates our terms of service in any manner may be removed from our servers (or otherwise disabled), with or without notice and NO full or partial refund will be issued at anytime.

<p></p>
Failure to respond to email from our abuse department within 48 hours may result in the suspension or termination of your services. All abuse issues must be dealt with via trouble ticket/email and will have a response within 48 hours.

<p></p>
If in doubt regarding the acceptability of your site or service, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8be2e5ede4cbdee5e2ede2eeefc7eaf2eef9f8a5e8e4e6">[email&#160;protected]</a> and we will be happy to assist you.

<p></p>
Potential harm to minors is strictly forbidden, including but not limited to child pornography or content perceived to be child pornography (Lolita):

<p></p>
Any site found to host child pornography or linking to child pornography will be suspended immediately without notice.

<p></p>
Resellers: we will suspend the site in question and will notify you so you may terminate the account. We will further monitor your activity; more than one infraction of this type may result in the immediate termination of your account.

<p></p>
Direct customers: Your services will be terminated with or without notice.

<p></p>
Violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

<p></p>
It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. It is required that you use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change/update your password.

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>3.) Zero Tolerance Spam Policy</h3>

<p></p>

<p>We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail, bulk emailing, and spam. &quot;Safe lists&quot; and purchased lists will be treated as spam. Any user who sends out spam will have their account terminated with or without notice.</p>
Sites advertised via SPAM (Spamvertised) may not be hosted on our servers. This provision includes, but is not limited to SPAM sent via fax, email, instant messaging, or usenet/newsgroups. No organization or entity listed in the ROKSO may be hosted on our servers. Any account which results in our IP space being blacklisted will be immediately suspended and/or terminated.

<p></p>
UnifiedLayers.com reserves the right to require changes or disable as necessary any web site, account, database, or other component that does not comply with its established policies, or to make any such modifications in an emergency at its sole discretion.

<p></p>
UnifiedLayers.com reserves the right to charge the holder of the account used to send any unsolicited e-mail a clean up fee or any charges incurred for blacklist removal. This cost of the clean up fee is entirely at the discretion of UnifiedLayers.com.

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>4.) Payment Information</h3>

<p></p>
You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from UnifiedLayers.com, in advance of the time period during which such services are provided. You agree that until and unless you notify UnifiedLayers.com of your desire to cancel any or all services received, those services will be billed on a recurring basis. This includes when accounts are suspended. When an account&#39;s invoices are paid outside of the 7 day grace period, invoices will not be automatically generated. However, after the customer notifies UnifiedLayers.com of his or intent to resume service, invoices will be manually generated and payment expected for the time the account was suspended.

<p></p>

<p>Cancellations must be done in writing via the cancellation form provided. Once we receive your cancellation and have confirmed all necessary information with you via e-mail, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject for your reference, and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic &quot;Your request has been received...&quot; email with a tracking number. We will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed. We are NOT responsible for any ongoing subscriptions from Paypal or any other funding source that make payments to UnifiedLayers.com unless you had provided us with the above information.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>7. Resource Usage</h3>

<p></p>
User may not:<br />
a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.<br />
b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.<br />
c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.<br />
d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.<br />
e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.<br />
f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities<br />
g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc<br />
h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes.<br />
i) When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL.<br />
Instead of include(&quot;http://yourdomain.com/include.php&quot;) use include(&quot;include.php&quot;)
<p></p>

<h3>7b.) INODES</h3>

<p></p>
The use of more than 250,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in a warning first, and if no action is taken future suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid over-usage. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.<br />
Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension. The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose &quot;Mail&quot;, then &quot;Default Address&quot;, &quot;Set Default Address&quot;, and then type in: :fail: No such user here.
<p></p>

<h3>7c.) Backup Limit</h3>

<p></p>
Any shared account using more than 5 gig of disk space will be removed from our site during weekly backup.

<p></p>

<h3>8.) Bandwidth Usage</h3>

<p></p>
You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month. Please contact us with information regarding excessive bandwidth plans at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="074e6961684752696e616e62634b667e6275742964686a">[email&#160;protected]</a>

<p></p>

<h3>9a.) Money back Guarantee</h3>

<p></p>
Each of UnifiedLayers.com&#39;s managed shared and reseller servers carry a 15 day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 15 days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.<br />
UnifiedLayers.com will not activate new orders or activate new packages for customers who have an outstanding balance with UnifiedLayers.com. For a new order to be setup or a new package to be activated, you must have a balance of $0.00, unless otherwise stated by UnifiedLayers.com in writing
<p></p>

<h3>10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</h3>

<p></p>
Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. UnifiedLayers.com does not provide support to our Reseller&#39;s Clients. If a reseller&#39;s client contacts us, we reserve the right to place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients&#39; behalf for security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients&#39;. UnifiedLayers.com will hold any reseller responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.

<p></p>

<h3>11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semi-dedicated Servers</h3>

<p></p>
Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account. Semi-dedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your own backups.

<p></p>

<h3>12.) Dedicated Servers</h3>

<p></p>
UnifiedLayers.com reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password resets. UnifiedLayers.com reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f29b9c949db2a79c9b949b9796be938b978081dc919d9f">[email&#160;protected]</a> if you wish to obtain a secondary hard drive. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>14.) Coupons</h3>

<p></p>
Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts *or first-time customers* only and may not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If you have signed up using a particular domain, you may not resign up for that domain using another coupon at a later date.

Coupon abuse will not be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of the account.
