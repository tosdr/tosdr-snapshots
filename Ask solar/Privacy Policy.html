<p>
	<h3>SECTION 1</h3>
	<h4>WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
</p>
<p>When you use our site, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.</p>
<p>When you browse our site, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.</p>
<p>Email marketing : With your permission, we may send you emails about our service, new products and other updates.</p>

<p><h3>SECTION 2</h3><h4>CONSENT</h4></p>
<p>How do you get my consent?</p>
<p>When you provide us with personal information to use our service, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
<p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
<p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
<p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9bf8f4f5effaf8efdbfae8f0e8f4f7fae9b5f8f4f6">[email&#160;protected]</a> or mailing us at: AdViz, LLC d/b/a AskSolar,  <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="abc8c4c5dfcac8dfebcad8c0d8c4c7cad985c8c4c6">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>

<p><h3>SECTION 3</h3><h4>DISCLOSURE</h4></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>

<p><h3>SECTION 4</h3><h4>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4></p>

<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>

<p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>

<p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>

<div class="more">
	<p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>

	<p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

	<p><h4>LINKS</h4></p>
	<p>When you click on links on our site, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>

<p><strong>A. Cookies, Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures</strong><br />
Certain parts of our Site require cookies. You may adjust your device or Internet browser settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Please refer to your device’s settings or your Internet browser’s “Help” section for more information on how to delete and/or disable cookies or to control your tracking preferences.</p>
<p>Our system may not recognize “do not track” (DNT) requests or headers from some or all browsers. We may use cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and to link data collected across other computers or devices that you may use.
</p>

<p><strong>B. Interest-Based Advertising Choices</strong><br />To understand your choices for receiving more relevant advertising provided on the Service or across other websites and online services, please review the information below:</p>
<div class="more">
<ul>
	<li>To learn more about such interest-based advertising, and to opt out of such collection and use for interest-based advertising by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participating companies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</li>
	<li>To opt out from the use of information about your online activities for interest-based advertising by Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) member companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</li>
	<li>To opt out of the use of your mobile device ID for targeted advertising, please see http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>C. Unsubscribing from Our Marketing Communications</strong><br />
	We provide our customers with the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to placement, processing, fulfillment, or delivery of a product or service. To opt out of marketing communications or to request to be added to our Do Not Call List or Do Not Mail List, you may use one of these convenient methods:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Electronic Promotional Offers:</strong> If you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt out from receiving commercial email from us by sending us an email or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy. You should note that unsubscribing from our electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe your information from electronic communications sent by any third party, and you will need to separately unsubscribe from such third party’s communication, if desired.</li>
	<li><strong>Direct Mail Offers:</strong> If you do not wish to be notified by postal mail regarding products, services, events, programs, and offers that we believe you may find of interest, you may opt out from such communications by sending us an email or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.</li>
	<li><strong>Telemarketing:</strong> If you do not want to receive marketing phone calls from us, you may: (i) email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="583b37362c393b2c18392b332b3734392a763b3735">[email&#160;protected]</a> with “Do Not Call” in the subject line; (ii) call customer care at 877-268-4395; (iii) ask to be placed on our Do Not Call list when you receive a call from us; or (iv) mail us at the address given at the end of this policy. Once we place your name on our internal “Do Not Call” list, we will no longer call you for marketing purposes (unless you submit another inquiry or request another consultation/quote from us subsequent to your initial request). Your instructions to limit the use of your information for these purposes will be processed as soon as reasonably practicable. Also, our Do-Not-Call process applies to calls made by us or by entities on our behalf. You may still receive calls from third parties who are not calling on our behalf regarding their products and services in which case you will need to request that those parties not call you, on a case-by-case basis.</li>
	<li><strong>Third Party Analytic Technologies</strong>:<br /> If you would like to opt out of participating in the collection of your web viewing data over time and across unaffiliated sites for interest-based and other applicable use, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>D. Unsubscribing from Third Party Communications</strong><br />
Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information, and your choices.
