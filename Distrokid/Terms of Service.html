<strong>User Content and Activity</strong><br>
The features and functionality of the Services may allow users to submit, upload, store and/or share reviews, comments, questions, messages, audio recordings, musical compositions, images, artwork, photographs, audio-visual content, text and other content, information or materials (&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;) directly through the Services, and users shall be able to share such User Content using the features made available by the Services from time to time. The functionality of the Services may allow registered users to make certain User Content publicly available for other users (registered or unregistered) to view, listen to and share. Other features of the Services may enable users to privately submit and share messages between users or to upload files to store and share for private use. The foregoing activities described in this paragraph are sometimes collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;User Activity&rdquo;. <br>
You are solely responsible for the User Content you submit through the Services as well as your User Activity generally.

With respect to the use of Direct Messages and/or Instant Share, for the sole purpose of operating and enabling these portions of the Services, you additionally grant to us a non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, host, store, search, scan and to share at your direction such Direct Messages and/or User Content, until you delete same from the applicable Services or until the Direct Messages and/or User Content are otherwise permanently removed. <br>
Accordingly you represent, warrant and agree that: (a) you have the right to agree to these Terms; (b) all of your User Content is original with you, in the public domain throughout the world or used by you with the express consents, permissions or licenses necessary from the original owner(s) of such materials for use by you and us pursuant to these Terms; (c) your User Content does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of publicity and privacy; (d) DistroKid shall not be responsible for payments or any other liability to any third party in connection with the use of your User Content on the Site, Application, Services or otherwise in connection with these Terms; and (e) none of your User Content or Direct Messages contain material which is unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, otherwise objectionable or content that may be deemed to constitute &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; <br>
DistroKid reserves the right to reject and/or remove any User Content, Direct Messages or other content that DistroKid believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. DistroKid takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content and/or Direct Messages that you or any other users or third parties post, use, store or share through the Services. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content or Direct Messages that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Services, is solely your responsibility.
