You are solely responsible for any Materials You provide. By submitting Materials to the Service, You warrant that You have all necessary rights to grant, and automatically grant to Red Cross and its affiliates, a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, publicly display, publicly perform, translate, and distribute such Materials (in whole or in part) and/or to incorporate them in other works in any form, media or technology now known or developed in the future.

<li><b>LINKS TO OTHER SERVICES.</b> Red Cross may provide links, in its sole discretion, to other services. Red Cross is not responsible for the availability of these outside resources or their contents. Red Cross expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, materials, accuracy of information and/or the quality of the products or services provided by, available through, or advertised on these third-party services, or the products or services provided by any third party.</li>

You acknowledge and agree that You shall have no ownership or other property interest in Your account and/or user name, and You further acknowledge and agree that all rights in and to Your user name and account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of Red Cross. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate suspension or termination of Your Authorized User Credentials. <b>RED CROSS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE OBLIGATIONS.</b> Red Cross reserves the right to delete or change Authorized User Credentials (with or without notice) at any time and for any reason.</li>

Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, or the limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, so some of the above may not apply to You.</li>
<li><b>ONLINE SHOPPING.</b> All product and service descriptions and depictions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The inclusion of any products or services on the Service does not imply or warrant that such products or services will be available. In the event a product or service available on or through the Service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, Red Cross will have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for the product or service listed at the incorrect price, whether due to a typographical error, an error in information received from Red Cross' suppliers or providers, or otherwise. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation neither signifies Red Cross’ acceptance of Your order, nor constitutes confirmation of Red Cross’ offer to sell. Red Cross reserves the right at any time after receipt of Your order to accept or decline Your order for any reason. Red Cross may charge and withhold the applicable sales tax for orders, otherwise. You are solely responsible for all sales or other taxes, on orders shipped to You. If You wish to purchase any product made available through the Service, You may be asked to supply certain information relevant to such transaction including, without limitation, Your credit card number, its expiration date and security code, the billing address, and any shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such credit card or payment information, You grant to the Red Cross the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of any transactions initiated by You or on Your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any such transaction. It is Your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any product or service purchased from the Service. By placing an order, You represent that the products and services ordered will be used only in a lawful manner pursuant to any additional terms that may accompany them. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the risk of loss for and title to products or services purchased on the Service passes to You upon electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, as applicable.<br />
<br />
Business customers must submit a Credit Approval and Purchase Order form. Customers who are approved for credit extensions will receive an invoice following order shipment. Invoices are produced four (4) times monthly so there may be more than one (1) order on an invoice for the same bill-to address and the same or different ship-to addresses. We do not send invoices to addresses outside the United States and its territories.<br />
<br />
You may opt into Electronic Invoice Delivery for the established account. You will provide a valid email address on your Credit Approval and Purchase Order form. You will receive a link in the email to a PDF copy of your invoice. The link expires thirty (30) days from receipt of the email. You confirm that you are authorized to opt in to electronic invoice delivery of American Red Cross Store invoice(s) on behalf of You or Your organization to one (1) designated email address. You understand that You or Your organization will not receive an invoice via postal mail after You have been successfully enrolled in electronic delivery. If the billing contact or invoice delivery email address changes for Your account, You will update that information by contacting Billing Support at <a href="mailto:billing@redcross.org">billing@redcross.org</a>. You or Your organization is responsible for payment regardless of receipt of the electronic invoice. If invoices are not received as expected, You understand that it is Your responsibility to contact Billing Support.<br />
<br />
Standard Payment Terms are NET 30. Payment in full is due on the date stated on the invoice. Payment of invoice is accepted by credit card or check. Past due amounts shall be subject to collections actions and may be referred to an external collections agency which will result in the termination of Your invoicing privileges. Credit card payment will be required if invoicing privileges are suspended or terminated.<br />
<br />
