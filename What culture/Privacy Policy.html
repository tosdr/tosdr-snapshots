Members of the public that sign up to use our services are not able to see this information, unless we, in our discretion, believe it presents a reasonable business need to provide that information to them. This may apply, for example, if we enlist the services of Freelance individuals who require the data to carry out their work.</p>

<h2><strong>Transfers outside of the European Economic Area</strong></h2>

<p>Personal information in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal information in the same way.</p>

<p>Our website and some of our applications or services or parts of them may also be hosted in the United States or otherwise outside of the EEA (which means all the EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) (“EEA”) and this means that we may transfer any information which is submitted by you through the website or the application or service outside the EEA to the United States or to other territories outside of the EEA. When you send an email to us, this will also be stored on email servers which are hosted with Google and therefore may be outside of the EEA.</p>

<p>We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us provide our website and services to you and this means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our advertising and services to you.</p>

<p>We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred outside of the EEA by our service providers and hosting providers, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. In each case, such transfers are made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulations or “GDPR”) and may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA.</p>

<p>By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your information outside the EEA in the circumstances set out in this Privacy Notice.

<h2><strong>Cookies, Analytics and Traffic Data</strong></h2>

<p>Cookies are small text files which are transferred from our websites or services and stored on your device. We use cookies to store the preferences of our visitors, to help us provide you with a personalised service, and to help make our websites and services better for you. Cookies may also be used to optimise user experiences by customising our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information. We use cookies and other tracking technologies to assist you in navigation, to analyse the use of our product, services or applications, to assist you in logging into our site and using our services and provide feedback, and for our advertising purposes.</p><!--StartFragment--><!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment--><!--EndFragment-->

<p>Our cookies may be <strong>session cookies</strong> (temporary cookies that identify and track users within our websites or services which are deleted when you close your browser or leave your session in the service) or <strong>persistent cookies</strong> (cookies which enable our websites or services to “remember” who you are and to remember your preferences within our websites or services and which will stay on your computer or device after you close your browser or leave your session in the application or service).</p>

<p>We use the following different types of cookies:</p>

<p><b>Strictly necessary cookies</b></p>

<p>These are cookies which are needed for our websites or services to function properly, for example, these cookies allow you to access secure areas of our website.</p>

<p><b>Performance cookies and analytics technologies</b></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about how visitors and users use our websites, applications and services, for instance which functionality visitors use most often, and if they get error messages from areas of the websites, applications or services. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor or user. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. We only use these cookies to improve how our website, applications and services work.</p>

<p><b>Targeting or advertising cookies</b></p>

<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertisers, advertising agencies or ad servicing technologies. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.</p>

<h2><b>Web beacons and parameter tracking</b></h2>

<p>We also use cookies and similar software known as web beacons to count users who have visited our website after clicking through from one of our advertisements on another website or in emails. These web beacons collect limited information which does not identify particular individuals. It is not possible to refuse the use of web beacons. However, because they are used in conjunction with cookies, you can effectively disable them by setting your browser to restrict or block cookies.</p>

<h2><b>IP Address and traffic data</b></h2>

<p>We keep a record of traffic data which is logged automatically by our servers (both our web site servers and our ad serving technologies), such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device information, the website that you visited before ours and the website you visit after leaving our site. We also collect some site and service statistics such as access rates and page views. We are not able to identify any individual from traffic data or site statistics.</p>

<h2><b>How to disable cookies</b></h2>

<p>You may be able to configure your browser or our website or the websites of our partners to restrict cookies or block all cookies if you wish, however if you disable cookies you may find this affects your ability to use certain parts of our website, or services. For more information about cookies and instructions on how to adjust your browser settings to accept, delete or reject cookies, see the <a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/">www.youronlinechoices.co.uk</a> website. To change your cookie preferences you may be able to use our consent manager which can be found here.</p>
