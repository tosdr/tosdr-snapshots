Deviating terms of the Customer or third parties shall only become part of this contract upon written acceptance by cleverbridge. These Ts&amp;Cs shall apply even where cleverbridge performs its contractual obligations without reservation despite being aware that the Customer’s conditions are inconsistent with the Ts&amp;Cs. Where the sale of Products and Services includes the provision of Services or other performance by third parties, the particular license and other conditions of the third party shall apply above and beyond these Ts&amp;Cs.</p> <p><strong>Entry into a Contract (Offer, Confirmation and Acceptance)</strong><br><strong>3.1</strong><br>An order placed by the Customer represents an offer to cleverbridge for the purchase of Products and Services under these Ts&amp;Cs. Such orders are subject to subsequent acceptance by cleverbridge. The Customer order is accepted through express confirmation or at the latest by the provision of the ordered Products and Services.<br><strong>3.2</strong><br>cleverbridge may, at its own discretion, use third parties to carry out its services.<br>Customer Warranties</p> <p>The Customer warrants that all the information the Customer provided when placing the order (including, but not limited to, personal data and payment data) was up-to-date and accurate in all material respects. The costs arising in relation to any incorrect data submitted by Customer or data amended by Customer after the submission of Customer’s order shall be borne by the Customer. To the extent that the Customer has access to a customer account with cleverbridge, the Customer is responsible for maintaining and immediately updating the Customer account details to ensure constant and continuous accuracy and completeness; the Customer shall not disclose the password used to access the customer account to third parties for any reason.</p> <p><strong>Approvals, Exports, Customs Duties</strong><br><strong>5.1</strong><br>To the extent that an approval or license from the government or other authority is required for the acquisition, transportation, or use of Products and Services, the Customer shall be obliged to obtain such approval or license at Customer’s own cost and provide cleverbridge with evidence of the same upon request. The fact that the Customer has yet to obtain an approval or license shall not entitle the Customer to withhold or delay payment. All costs and expenses incurred to cleverbridge on the basis of such a failure to obtain an approval or license or its being obtained erroneously shall be for the account of the Customer. For Consumers, this shall not apply in relation to an approval or other permit for transportation.<br><strong>5.2</strong><br>The Products and Services sold by cleverbridge and made available to the Customer electronically or physically may give the Customer access to technologies and Software which are subject to the export controls of the Federal Republic of Germany, the export controls of the United States of America or those of the countries in which the Products and Services are being marketed or in which they are being used. The Customer undertakes to observe these export controls. cleverbridge shall be entitled to withdraw from the Contract where the Customer breaches export controls.<br><strong>5.3</strong><br>Importing goods into the European Economic Area may, where specific goods values are exceeded, lead to customs duties (e.g. where the value of the goods exceeds the Customer’s personal allowance). Upon the arrival of the goods at the place designated by the Customer the latter may incur customs duties, import duties, or taxes imposed by the relevant authorities. All such additional costs shall be borne by the Customer as they are beyond cleverbridge’s control and the latter has no knowledge of them. More detailed information on customs regulations or duties can be obtained by the Customer from the customs office responsible for Customer’s jurisdiction.<br>Prices, Payment Conditions, and Default<br><strong>6.1</strong><br>The payment of the purchase price is due immediately upon entry into the contract and shall take place in the manner specified on the cleverbridge Website. With the exception of purchase orders and pay-per-use products, payments shall take place prior to delivery. For pay-per-use products, Customer shall be billed automatically at the intervals indicated on the cleverbridge Website. Where the Customer has purchased a Subscription, the Customer shall at each Subscription Payment Interval pay the price of the Subscription or make the corresponding purchase price available using the payment option agreed upon between the Customer and cleverbridge.<br><strong>6.2</strong></p> <p><strong>Payments by BusinessesTo Business, the following provisions shall apply</strong>:</p> <p>In the event that the Customer is a Business, it shall identify itself as a such when the order is placed. cleverbridge may consider the address provided as Business’s place of business, unless indicated otherwise. If Business’s VAT ID is registered to another country, cleverbridge may also employ that information for tax purposes. cleverbridge will apply taxes to the extent required by law. cleverbridge may apply and charge taxes after the Business has made the payment for the Products and Services according to Clause 6.1. The Business is then obliged to subsequently pay the remaining amount of taxes to cleverbridge. Additionally, as a recipient of the Products and Services, the Business may have the obligation to remit VAT, sales taxes, or similar consumption taxes (“Reverse Charge Mechanism”). If the Business is required to pay or withhold any tax for payments made to cleverbridge, cleverbridge remains entitled to the amount due under Clause 6.1 in full and free of any deductions. The purchase price shall be increased by the amount of taxes paid or withheld by the Business (gross-up). The Business will provide documentation to cleverbridge, which certifies that all applicable taxes have been paid to the relevant tax authority within 30 days after the date of payment of the purchase price. For purposes of this Clause, taxes means any sales, use, gross receipts, business, occupation, and other taxes (other than taxes on the income of cleverbridge) and similar charges imposed by any government or other authority, with the exception of VAT levied by a member of the European Union.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong></p> <p>Individual Payment MethodsCustomer’s bank or credit card issuer may charge additional service fees for international credit card payments (“Foreign Transaction Fee”), depending on whether the Customer provides the payment in a foreign currency or to a merchant established in another country (e.g. cleverbridge as merchant established in Germany).</p> <p>Foreign Transaction Fees charges and amounts are individually agreed upon between banks / credit card issuers and Customers. cleverbridge has no insight into such agreements and can therefore provide no information on Foreign Transaction Fees and similar fees or charges. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, THEREFORE, ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF CLEVERBRIDGE FOR CHARGED FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEES IS EXCLUDED AND THAT THE CUSTOMER IS SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIABLE FOR PAYING SUCH FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEES.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong><br>If the Customer choses SEPA direct debit as applicable payment method, the Customer will be notified by means of a pre-notification (“Pre-Notification”) directly after submitting the order. The Customer’s account will be charged the day after Pre-Notification.Should the payment be declined or reversed, for example, due to erroneous account data or insufficient funds in the Customer’s account, cleverbridge is entitled to invoice an additional EUR 10.00 to compensate cleverbridge for the related additional work and transaction costs. This fee shall not be levied if the Customer provides evidence that no loss at all has been suffered, or one that is significantly less than the fee of EUR 10.00. cleverbridge shall be entitled to claim for compensation of higher actual costs upon providing evidence of the same.<br><strong>6.5</strong><br>In case of any advance deliveries (purchase order or purchase with grant of a direct debit authorization) payments shall be made in full irrespective of any claims for short deliveries or Product defects. cleverbridge reserves the right to cancel any order if payment has not been completed within 14 days.<br><strong>6.6</strong><br>If payment is made with any one of the following payment methods, Customer will have 14 days to complete the order by providing funds for the order: Boleto Bancário, Konbini, PayNearMe, wire transfer. cleverbridge reserves the right to cancel any order if payment has not been completed within 14 days.<br><strong>6.7</strong><br>If cleverbridge and Customer agree on using bills of exchange or checks as payment method, payment shall only be considered made once they have been redeemed. Discount and collection charges shall be for the Customer’s account. cleverbridge shall not be liable for their prompt submission.<br><strong>6.8</strong><br>Card Refresher Service for American Express® customers within the USAAmerican Express customers agree that cleverbridge may receive information from the credit card issuer regarding the customer’s updated card account status, including cancellation of the credit card account and changes to the credit card number or expiration date. It is the obligation of the customer to determine whether the customer’s credit card issuer provides the Card Refresher Service.<br><strong>6.9</strong><br>Default of PaymentTo the extent that, in case of purchase on account, the invoice includes a payment deadline the Customer shall be in default of payment if the full purchase price payment is not credited to a cleverbridge account or received by cleverbridge by such deadline. This also applies if selected payment method is insufficient to cover full amount within such deadline. In case cleverbridge and Customer have agreed on direct debit as payment method, this shall only apply if cleverbridge has reasonably tried to debit the amount from the bank account.<br><strong>6.10</strong><br>Default interest for Customers placing their order from outside the USAWhere a Consumer defaults, the Consumer shall pay cleverbridge late payment interest of five percentage points (5%) over the base rate applicable at the time of the default. Where a Business defaults, the interest rate shall be nine percentage points (9%) over the base rate. “Base rate” means a variable interest rate set at half-yearly intervals by the German Central Bank (“Bundesbank”) which, increased by a fixed margin, gives the late-payment interest rate (https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/organisation/gtc-and-legal-basis/basic-rate-of-interest-616708).<br><strong>6.11</strong><br>Default interest for Customers placing their order from within the USAWithout limiting other remedies, cleverbridge reserves the right to charge a late fee on all past due payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by applicable law.<br><strong>6.12</strong><br>In case of default cleverbridge reserves the right to cancel the order and/or claim damages.<br>Price Adjustment for Subscription Products and Subscription Services<br><strong>7.1</strong><br>The price for the Products and Services consists of the sales margin of cleverbridge, the procurement costs of cleverbridge for the Products and Services and the applicable taxes. The sales margin covers the costs of cleverbridge for the IT infrastructure, personnel and transaction processing. During the lifetime of a Subscription, the framework for the price calculation may change from one Subscription Payment Interval to the next. Therefore, in this Clause 7 the Parties agree upon the requirement and procedures for adapting the Subscription price.<br><strong>7.2</strong><br>Any additional taxes and duties imposed on the sales of Product and Service shall be borne by the Customer. This applies correspondingly to changes of the taxes and duties already billed to Customer; cleverbridge is also obliged to pass on abolitions and reductions of taxes and duties.<br><strong>7.3</strong><br>On the basis of this contract, cleverbridge will adapt the prices for the Products and Services to the change in costs cleverbridge incurs or in prices cleverbridge has to pay for Products and Services at its reasonable discretion. The price may be increased and will be decreased if e.g. the procurement costs for Products and Services rise or fall, or other changes in the economic and legal framework result in changed costs (e.g. through increased costs for the IT infrastructure or transaction processing). If costs of one type rise, e.g. procurement costs, cleverbridge may increase the price only to the extent there are no falling costs of another type. If costs of one type fall, e.g. procurement costs, cleverbridge will reduce the price to the extent this is not balanced out by rising prices of another type. Exercising reasonable discretion, cleverbridge will define the time of price change in a way that cost reductions have at least the same effect on the price change as cost increases.<br><strong>7.4</strong><br>cleverbridge will inform Customer in a timely manner about any price changes so that the Customer is able to cancel the Subscription before the first billing of the changed price.<br>Delivery, Delivery Period<br><strong>8.1</strong><br>The delivery of the ordered goods shall be carried out according to the delivery information on the relevant cleverbridge Website, as amended from time to time.<br><strong>8.2</strong><br>For Customers placing their order from within the USA, the delivery dates are estimates only.<br><strong>8.3</strong><br>The agreed delivery period shall begin upon receipt of payment in full by cleverbridge and Customer’s accurate supply of all data necessary for the processing of the order to cleverbridge or the payment services provider selected by the Customer.<br><strong>8.4</strong><br>Delivery delays caused by statutory or official arrangements (e.g. import and export restrictions) and that are not the fault of cleverbridge shall extend the delivery period for a time equivalent to the duration of such obstacles. In important cases cleverbridge shall immediately notify the Customer of their commencement and termination, to the extent cleverbridge is aware of the same.<br><strong>8.5</strong></p> <p><strong>Physical Products and Services</strong></p> <p><strong>8.5.1</strong><br>To the extent the Customer fails to accept the delivered Products, or to the extent the Customer rejects them, risk of damage or loss of the Product shall pass to the Customer without prejudice to all other rights to which cleverbridge is entitled:cleverbridge shall be entitled, at the Customer’s risk and cost, to endeavor to have the Product delivered by such means it deems suitable and reasonable and to put the Product into storage at the Customer’s risk and cost.<br><strong>8.5.2</strong><br>cleverbridge shall be entitled to make partial deliveries to the extent this is reasonable. To the extent cleverbridge makes partial deliveries to Businesses each partial delivery shall represent a separate contract and Businesses shall, in case of defects in one or more partial deliveries, not be entitled to cancel subsequent partial deliveries.<br><strong>8.5.3</strong><br>The risk of accidental destruction and accidental deterioration is assumed by Businesses as soon as the Product is received by the person carrying out transportation but no later than upon entering the Customer’s possession.<br>Retention of Title</p> <p>cleverbridge retains title to the Product until payment in full of all claims under the contract including secondary claims (e.g. costs of exchange, financing costs, interest etc.) is received.</p> <p><strong>Usage Rights, License</strong><br><strong>10.1</strong><br>To the extent that the Products and Services delivered by cleverbridge consist of or include an activation code as described in Clause 1.5 (a) or a Service, the Customer accepts that the use of the corresponding Software or respectively the provision of the corresponding Service is subject to acceptance of Supplier’s licensing conditions and terms of use (“EULA”).

The Customer acknowledges that the Software or Service may only be reproduced, adapted, transmitted, made available, marketed, altered, disassembled, decompiled, re-transmitted or combined with other software or another Service as expressly permitted under the EULA or the applicable law.<br><strong>10.2</strong></p> <p>Where the Customera) does not receive the EULA prior to purchase of the relevant Product or the relevant Service or the EULA are not enclosed with the Software and</p> <p><strong>b)</strong> the Customer does not use or has not used the Software or the Service, or</p> <p><strong>c)</strong> does not agree to the licensing conditions and terms of use and does not wish to use the Software or the Service on the basis of these licensing conditions and terms of use, the Customer may contact cleverbridge and request the repayment of the amounts paid for the Software or the Service. cleverbridge may, in return, request the return of the Software or Service to cleverbridge (where possible). In this case, however, the Customer shall have no rights whatsoever to use such Software or such Service.</p> <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p> <p>Customer data is subject to electronic data processing. Where necessary, cleverbridge forwards personal data to the Supplier of the Products and Services purchased by the Customer, service partners or affiliated companies, some of which may be located outside the European Economic Area, including the USA, subject to compliance with the statutory requirements concerning appropriate safeguards. cleverbridge’s full privacy policy can be viewed under “Privacy Policy”.</p> <p><strong>Defects, Claims in respect of Defects and Exclusion of Liability</strong></p> <p>cleverbridge is only legally responsible for the proper condition of Products and Services as defined in Clauses 1.5 and <strong>1.6.</strong> Since cleverbridge does not sell Software, the corresponding liability is waived in Clauses 12.6.2 and 12.7.1.</p> <p>The provisions of Sections 12.1 – 12.6 shall apply only to Customers who place an order from outside the USA. Section 12.7 shall apply to Customers who place an order from within the USA.</p> <p><strong>12.1</strong><br>All information on cleverbridge’s Products and Services is merely by way of description and does not represent a guarantee.<br><strong>12.2</strong><br><strong>Defective Products and Services</strong><br>A Product is defective where it lacks the agreed quality, is not suitable for the agreed use or appropriate for the customary use and does not demonstrate the quality usual for Products of the same type and which the purchaser can expect of this type of Product. A Product is also defective where it infringes industrial property rights, copyright or other third-party rights. The technical and legal regulations applicable in Germany shall apply unless specifically agreed otherwise.Services or the provision of Services are defective to the extent they do not comply with the contractual agreements.<br><strong>12.3</strong><br><strong>Duty of Inspection and Notification</strong><br>Businesses shall be obliged to test the Products under normal operating conditions immediately after delivery and to make sure that they are in perfect condition, match the Product description and are complete. Claims may only be made with respect to rights based on Product defects or a short delivery if the Customer notifies cleverbridge in writing or by email of the Product defects or short delivery immediately and in any case no later than five days after receipt of the Products or in the case of a hidden defect, immediately after becoming aware of the respective hidden defect.

The provisions of the UN Convention of 11 April 1980 on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (the Vienna Convention) shall not apply.</p> <p><strong>17.2</strong></p> <p>Jurisdiction and applicable law for Customers placing their order from within the USA (Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration)</p> <p><strong>17.2.1</strong></p> <p>cleverbridge and the Customer agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between the two parties (the “Parties”). This contract to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p> <p>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between the Parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<br>Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement between the Parties (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<br>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which Customer is not a member of a certified class; and<br>Claims that may arise after the termination of any agreement between the Parties.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. Customer agrees that, by accepting these terms and conditions, Customer and cleverbridge are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The transaction between the Parties evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the contract entered into by the Parties.</p> <p><strong>17.2.2</strong><br>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to cleverbridge should be addressed to: cleverbridge AG, Gereonstr. 43-65, 50670 Cologne, Germany, (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If cleverbridge and Customer do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, Customer or cleverbridge may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by cleverbridge or Customer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or cleverbridge is entitled. Customer may download or copy a form Notice.<br><strong>17.2.3</strong><br>After cleverbridge receives notice at the Notice Address that Customer has commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse Customer for Customer’s payment of the filing fee. If Customer is unable to pay this fee, cleverbridge will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these terms and conditions, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration provision, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these terms and conditions. Unless cleverbridge and Customer agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Customer’s billing address. If Customer’s claim is for Ten Thousand U.S Dollars (US$10,000) or less, cleverbridge agrees that Customer may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Customer’s claim exceeds Ten Thousand U.S Dollars (US$10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, cleverbridge will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that the substance of Customer’s claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, Customer agrees to reimburse cleverbridge for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Customer’s obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.<br><strong>17.2.4</strong></p> <p>If, after finding in Customer’s favor in any respect on the merits of Customer’s claim, the arbitrator issues Customer an award that is:</p> <p>Equal to or less than the greater of (a) Two Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$2,000) or (b) the maximum claim that may be brought in small claims court in the county of the Customer’s billing address, and<br>Greater than the value of cleverbridge’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then cleverbridge will:<br>Pay Customer the greater of (a) Two Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$2,000) or (b) the maximum claim that may be brought in small claims court in the county of Customer’s billing address (“the premium”) instead of the arbitrator’s award; and<br>Pay Customer’s attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys’ fees, and reimburse any expenses that Customer’s attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing the Customer’s claim in arbitration (“the attorney premium”).</p> <p>If cleverbridge did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, Customer and Customer’s attorney will be entitled to receive the premium and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards Customer any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the premium and the attorney premium at any time during the proceedings and upon request form either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p> <p><strong>17.2.5</strong><br>The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses set forth in Clause 17.2.4 supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses Customer may have under applicable law. Thus, if Customer would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding Customer that amount. However, Customer may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or costs. Although under some laws cleverbridge may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, cleverbridge agrees that it will not seek such an award.<br><strong>17.2.6</strong><br>The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. CUSTOMER AND CLEVERBRIDGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN CUSTOMER’S OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both Customer and cleverbridge agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.<br><strong>17.2.7</strong><br>This contract will be construed in accordance with and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA, without regard to any conflicts of law principles that would result in application of laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this contract.<br>Entire Contract</p> <p>These Ts&amp;Cs cover the entire contract between the Parties in relation to the stated dealings and replace any previous or simultaneous agreements, communications and arrangements between the Parties (whether oral or in writing) in relation to the present subject matter. Amendments and additions to these Ts&amp;Cs shall be in writing. The written-form requirement may only be waived in writing.</p> <p>Validity</p> <p>Should a provision of these Ts&amp;Cs or a provision within the context of any other agreements be or become invalid then this shall not affect the validity of the other agreements or provisions. The applicable statutory law shall apply in place of the invalid provisions.</p> <p>cleverbridge AG and cleverbridge, Inc.</p> <p>Version: January 2017</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sticky-image-wrapper"> <img src="https://download1.franzis.de/cdn/media/image/34/89/e2/franzis-trendshop-2024.png" /> </div> </div> </section> <footer class="footer-main"> <div class="container-fluid usp--bg"> <div class="container"> <div class="usp block"> <ul class="usp--list"> <li> <i class="icomoon--lock"></i> Software made in Germany </li> <li> <i class="icomoon--euro"></i> Competence for more than 30 years </li> <li> <i class="icomoon--speech_bubble"></i> User-Manuals, Tutorials and Quick-Tips available </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer--columns block-group"> <div class="container"> <div class="footer--column column--hotline is--first block"> <div class="column--headline">About us</div> <nav class="column--navigation column--content"> <ul class="navigation--list" role="menu"> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/affiliate" title="Affiliate" target="_parent"> Affiliate </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/mediacooperation" title="Media Cooperation"> Media Cooperation </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/imprint" title="Imprint"> Imprint </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/general-terms-and-conditions" title="General Terms and Conditions"> General Terms and Conditions </a> </li> </ul> </nav> </div> <div class="footer--column column--menu block"> <div class="column--headline">Shop service</div> <nav class="column--navigation column--content"> <ul class="navigation--list" role="menu"> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/coupon" title="Coupon" target="_parent"> Coupon </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="/support" title="Support" target="_self"> Support </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="/frequently-asked-questions" title="Knowledgebase" target="_self"> Knowledgebase </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/contact-us" title="Contact us"> Contact us </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="/newsletter" title="Newsletter"> Newsletter </a> </li> </ul> </nav> </div> <div class="footer--column column--menu block"> <div class="column--headline">Information</div> <nav class="column--navigation column--content"> <ul class="navigation--list" role="menu"> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/eula" title="eula"> eula </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/sitemap.xml" title="Sitemap"> Sitemap </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="https://www.projects-software.com/data-protection" title="Data protection"> Data protection </a> </li> <li class="navigation--entry" role="menuitem"> <a class="navigation--link" href="/?cmpscreen" title="Privacy Settings" target="_parent"> Privacy Settings </a> </li> </ul> </nav> </div> <div class="footer--column column--newsletter is--last block"> <div class="column--headline">Payment options</div> <nav class="column--navigation column--content"> <ul class="payment block-group"> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/mastercard.png" alt="Mastercard"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/visa.png" alt="Visa"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/AmEx.png" alt="American Express"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/paypal.png" alt="Paypal"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/sofortueberweisung.png" alt="Sofortüberweisung"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/text-vorkasse.png" alt="Visa"> </li> <li> <img src="/themes/Frontend/Franzis/frontend/_public/src/img/payments/text-rechnung.png" alt="Mastercard"> </li> </ul> </nav> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container-fluid"> <div class="footer--bottom container"> <div class="footer--claim"> Our project packages can turn an ordinary photo into one that’s impressive. </div> <div class="footer--copyright"> © 2024 FRANZIS GmbH </div> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script id="footer--js-inline">
