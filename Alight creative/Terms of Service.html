<li><p><strong>Dispute Resolution; Binding Individual Arbitration</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND AI CREATIVITY</strong> <strong>TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND AI CREATIVITY</strong> <strong>FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND AI CREATIVITY</strong> <strong>AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. AI CREATIVITY</strong> <strong>AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY’S CLAIMS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IN SECTION 19(L) IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>a) Claims Subject to this Section</strong>. The dispute resolution and binding arbitration terms in this Section 19 apply to all Claims between you and AI Creativity. A “<strong>Claim</strong>” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and AI Creativity, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or our Services, including any related to privacy or data-security or to the formation, validity, enforceability, revocability, performance, breach, or scope of the Terms or arbitration agreement or any portion of it or arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of the Terms or arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>b) Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration</strong>. If you have a Claim against AI Creativity or if AI Creativity has a Claim against you, you and AI Creativity must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally in order to try to resolve the Claim faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and AI Creativity will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties, (“<strong>Informal Resolution Period</strong>”) from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “<strong>Claimant Notice</strong>”) in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>You will send any Claimant Notice to AI Creativity by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to aicreativity@legalmail.it. AI Creativity will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to AI Creativity or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to AI Creativity. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.</p>
<p>The Informal Resolution Period is intended to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or AI Creativity cannot initiate arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or AI Creativity file a Claim in court or initiate arbitration without first providing a compliant Claimant Notice and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court or arbitrator to enjoin the filing or arbitration and seek damages from the party that has not followed the informal dispute-resolution process to reimburse it for any costs and fees—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.</p>
<p>The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim shall be tolled for the duration of the Information Resolution Period for that Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.</p>
<p><strong>c) Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions</strong>. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or AI Creativity, including any disputes in which you or AI Creativity seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or AI Creativity’s intellectual property (“<strong>IP Claims</strong>”), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 19(b) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury.</p>
<p><strong>d) Binding Individual Arbitration</strong>. Subject to the Terms of this section, Claims may only be adjudicated by binding individual arbitration conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“<strong>NAM</strong>”), <a href="https://namadr.com" class="uri">https://namadr.com</a>, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., (“<strong>FAA”</strong>) and NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Claim arose (the “<strong>Rules”</strong>), as modified by these Terms.</p>
<p>If NAM notifies the parties in writing (email suffices) that it is not available to arbitrate any Claim, then that Claim may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), <a href="https://www.adr.org" class="uri">https://www.adr.org</a>. For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” meaning that you only use the Services for personal, family, or household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules apply to Claims between you and AI Creativity, as modified by these Terms. For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are not a “Consumer,” the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures apply to Claims between you and AI Creativity as modified by these Terms.</p>
<p>These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section 19 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.</p>
<p><strong>e) Arbitration Procedure and Location</strong>. You or AI Creativity may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with NAM (or with AAA if applicable pursuant to Section 19(d)).</p>
<p>Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by emailing NAM at <a href="mailto:commercial@namadr.com">commercial@namadr.com</a>, and instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to AI Creativity by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to aicreativity@legalmail.it. AI Creativity will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to AI Creativity or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to AI Creativity.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and AI Creativity both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or less, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks more than USD $10,000, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules.</p>
<p>The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and AI Creativity agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; they cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>f) Arbitration Fees.</strong> Except for circumstances outlined in Sections 19(g) and 19(h), each party will be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>g) Frivolous or Improper Claims.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs and fees incurred by the defending party—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the Claim was filed for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution.</p>
<p><strong>h) Offers of Settlement</strong>: Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer for a Claim. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable to a party than the latest written offer of settlement that party rejected, that party must pay all arbitration costs and fees incurred by the other party after the written settlement offer was made.</p>
<p><strong>i) One Year to Assert Claims. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR AI CREATIVITY AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU OR AI CREATIVITY WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT CLAIM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>j) Confidentiality.</strong> If you or AI Creativity submits a Claim to arbitration, you and AI Creativity agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and AI Creativity agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>k) Coordinated Filings.</strong> If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “<strong>Coordinated Claims</strong>” and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Claims are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You or AI Creativity may advise the other of your or its belief that Claims are Coordinated Claims, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Coordinated Claims” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter.</p>
<p><strong>COORDINATED CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE FILED IN ARBITRATION AS PERMITTED BY THE BELLWETHER PROCESS SET FORTH BELOW.</strong> <strong>APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL BE TOLLED FOR CLAIMS ASSERTED AS COORDINATED CLAIMS FROM THE TIME A COMPLIANT CLAIMANT NOTICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY A PARTY UNTIL THESE TERMS PERMIT SUCH COORDINATED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN ARBITRATION OR COURT.</strong></p>
<p>The bellwether process set forth in this section will not proceed until counsel representing the Coordinated Claims has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Coordinated Claims have been provided.</p>
<p>After that point, counsel for the parties shall select 20 Coordinated Claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its claims and arguments. Each side shall select 10 claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Claims will be delayed by this bellwether process.</p>
<p>A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Claim chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Claim may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p>Once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the other party agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Claims, with the mediator’s fee paid for by AI Creativity. Counsel for the claimants and the other party must agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the other party cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.</p>
<p>If the mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining Coordinated Claims, the arbitration requirement in this Section 19 shall no longer apply to Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with Section 19.</p>
<p>To the extent you are asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable.</p>
<p>If Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement are brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.</p>
<p>A court shall have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this Section 19(k) and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.</p>
<p><strong>l) Opting Out of Arbitration</strong>. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accept these Terms by providing us with notice of your decision to opt out via email at aicreativity@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. If you opt out of this updated arbitration clause and were previously subject to an arbitration clause in effect prior to this updated arbitration clause, then that prior arbitration clause shall remain as the agreement between us. If you are a new user and did not previously consent to the prior arbitration clause and you choose to opt-out of this updated agreement, then we will also not be bound by this updated arbitration clause.</p>
<p><strong>m) Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any change we make to Section 19 (except address changes) by sending us notice of your rejection within 30 days of the change via email at aicreativity@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy. Changes to Section 19 may only be rejected as a whole, and you may not reject only certain changes to Section 19. If you reject changes made to Section 19, the most recent version of Section 19 that you have not rejected will continue to apply.</p>
<p><strong>n) Severability</strong>. If any portion of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 19 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 19; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 19 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 19 will be enforceable.</p>

In such cases, if reasonably necessary or if required under applicable law, we will notify you via email or a pop-up or push notification within the Service. If you are a consumer resident in the European Economic Area and any such update, change, suspension or discontinuation of the Service (or any part, content or feature) would reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse impact on your access or use of the Service, we will notify you in advance and you will be entitled to withdraw from these Terms free of charge during the notice period. We will not be liable for the limitation, removal of, or disabling of access to any such services or materials in accordance with these Terms.</p>

For Claims in which the claimant seeks more than USD $10,000, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence.
