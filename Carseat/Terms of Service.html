<b>22.    DISPUTES</b><br />
<br />
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the TOS, with the exception of those controversies or claims specifically excluded below, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”). The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.<br />
<br />
You and Car-Seat.Org agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between Car-Seat.Org and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is not right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.<br />
<br />
You and Car-Seat.Org agree that the following disputes are not subject to this binding arbitration provision: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Car-Seat.Org’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.<br />
<br />
For any dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, you and Car-Seat.Org agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Chicago, Illinois. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. Car-Seat.Org controls the Service from its offices within the United States of America, and the Service is intended for use only in the United States of America.

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Car-Seat.Org Guidelines</b><br />
Participation at Car-Seat.Org constitutes agreement to the following guidelines, which apply to posts, profile information, avatars, signatures, any other content on this site and participation in general. This includes private messages, which Admin has the ability to read, but will only do so in rare cases when a violation (such as harrassment or illegal activity) is reported to us or we have another legitimate reason.<br />
<br />
<i>Before participating in any forum at Car-Seat.Org, please review our <a href="http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=170684" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D170684&amp;hash=1fd84b24c6af9108a5939c28f31992d6">TERMS OF SERVICE</a> and <a href="http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=170685" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D170685&amp;hash=978e1e4c75bbd4147353a2845af4adc5">PRIVACY POLICY</a> above, and all the Announcements and sticky &quot;Important&quot; posts in that forum.</i>  These contain far more details than are included here.  Failure to read these posts will not excuse you from violations of our rules and guidelines.  In addition, visitors are advised to read this unofficial thread about <a href="http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=47001" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D47001&amp;hash=814a64e5f2e01a9a212b37bba57b473b">typical etiquette</a> at Car-Seat.org.  It is very helpful for new members.<br />
<br />
Because of the live nature of the discussions on this community, it is not possible for us to review and/or confirm the accuracy or validity of a message before it is posted. If you believe that someone has violated our User Guidelines or you have spotted content that may otherwise require attention, please use the &quot;Report Post&quot; feature by clicking the Report Post link at the bottom. You may also send a private message to any Admin with a link to the content and a brief description of what you believe is wrong.  Notification is voluntary and anonymous, but in no case should a user respond to a situation personally, thereby aggravating the situation further. Responding to a violation in an inflammatory manner is also a violation in itself and will result in appropriate action.  Admins and moderators do review all Reported Posts and complaints.  We may respond to these reports in public or private.  Sometimes we may decide no response is required.<br />
<br />
While our forums are operated by volunteer moderators, we do attempt to generate revenue through avenues that we deem appropriate.  Forum donations are used for website costs and child passenger safety related expenses.  Please see <a href="http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=20767" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D20767&amp;hash=f33529eb0bbfd8596ae513fef9fdb8a1">Support Car-Seat.Org</a> for more details.  Any content that violates our User Guidelines will be removed.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Interpretation of our guidelines is at the discretion of the staff and not the member</u>.  Please consider that our moderators are volunteers.  We are parents and safety advocates, just like most of our membership.  Testing the limits and pushing the guidelines may seem like great fun, but it's a genuine hassle for the moderators who try to make sure everyone plays fairly, by the same guidelines.  We simply don't have the time to police every thread.  Generally, we react to reported posts and for that reason we encourage our members to use that feature if you see a post that you think is a violation of our community guidelines.</b><br />
<br />
1. Cross-posting is not allowed and will result in the removal of one or more posts. Cross-posting is defined as posting the same information in two or more locations. When posting your topic, please try to post it in the most appropriate place within the organizational structure of our community. Identical topics posted in the same or different forums will be removed.<br />
<br />
2. While member post count has meaning, it should not be taken too seriously. Attempts to artificially increase your post count are prohibited. This includes the mass creation of short or meaningless posts. When participating in game threads such as &quot;Word Association Game&quot; or &quot;What song are you listening to right now?&quot; please do not post consecutive replies within a short period of time.  Such posts are also considered spam, even if they do not include links or references to a commercial interest.<br />
<br />
3. Advertisements are not permitted, except for limited content allowed for forum Sponsors.  Generally speaking, posts made specifically for the promotion of a website, product or service are considered advertising.  This includes posts made that unnecessarily send people to a website that you are in some way affiliated or solicit people to contact you in private.  While we often allow links to non-revenue-generating personal websites, blogs, photo albums and certain 501(c)(3) non-profits, these are always subject to moderator discretion and may be removed without warning.  We generally do not allow any links to Amazon affiliate and certain other retailer affiliate websites.  More details on advertising can be found in this <a href="http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=38149" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D38149&amp;hash=77e6f812fcb66ce2bb746bf94f1cac0d">announcement</a>.  We may authorize and/or sell advertisements on a case-by-case basis. If you are interested in utilizing this option, please contact us.<br />
<br />
All signature links must be kept in your signature in your profile.  Signature links to any type of commercial or revenue-generating website are prohibited, except for certain types of links allowed for forum sponsors.  Again, we usually will allow signature links to non-commercial personal websites, blogs, photo albums and 501(c)(3) non-profit websites in the area of child safety or automotive safety, these are always subject to moderator discretion and may be removed without warning.  Anyone found to be posting excessive links to their websites or suspected of using &quot;sneaky&quot; advertising methods is in violation of this guideline. You may only post a link to a site that you are in some way affiliated with if the link specifically answers the question that is being asked and the answer cannot be simply posted without the link. Even then, link directly to the page where the information can be found. General and unnecessary links will be tagged as advertising. If you are found to be excessively posting links to your site or any commercial web page (or you appear to be seeking out threads where your link may be relevant, so that you can post it), you may lose the ability to post links to your site.<br />
<br />
4. You are not allowed to post an affiliate URL that leads to you (or another entity) earning cash, banner impressions, credits, points, etc.  An admin may grant an exception to this in special cases, upon request.  Affiliate tagged links and offers may not be used or referred to in posts or signatures, nor are users allowed to solicit inquiries for referrals or pyramid schemes in their posts, signatures or via unsolicited private messages.  Links to websites that display Amazon affiliate banners and/or links are also generally not allowed.<br />
<br />
5. Do not post personal, real-life information such as home addresses and home phone numbers.  If you need to have personal information removed and cannot edit or delete the post on your own, please use the &quot;Report Post&quot; feature and specify what content you want edited.<br />
<br />
6. As this is an English-speaking community, we require that posted content be in the English language, so that it can be well received and properly monitored.<br />
<br />
7. Vulgar language and inappropriate material is not allowed and will be removed from posts in all public forums and from thread titles in any forum, public or private.  Everything in our public forums should be G-rated and appropriate for a family audience.  Abbreviations, self censoring, and attempts to circumvent the word censoring feature of the community software (if enabled) also violate this guideline. If your post contains a word that is censored by the software, you must remove that word or the post will be removed. If you feel that the censor is acting in error, please contact us.  Some freedom for expression, including vulgar language, may be allowed on our private, community forums at the discretion of the moderators.  Such posts should make use of the relevant &quot;Warning&quot; prefix to alert readers of the content.  Repeated or overly offensive vulgar language will be removed without warning and an infraction to the member may result.<br />
<br />
We try to maintain a family friendly atmosphere whenever it is possible within the main subject matter of this community. Please keep this in mind when participating.  In addition to specific vulgar language, we have a wide interpretation of bullying and trolling and will not hesitate to remove members who disrupt our community with unfriendly or inappropriate participation of any kind, as deemed by the moderator staff for any reason.  Please also see #13 below.<br />
<br />
8. When linking to outside websites, you must ensure that the content of the link is appropriate for our community, in line with the guidelines laid out here. This includes mentioning or referencing a site, even if the mention is not hyperlinked. If you post a link and that link is automatically censored, it is considered to be an inappropriate link and you should remove it from your post immediately. If left, all posts that feature inappropriate links will be removed.  Posts that include news stories and/or videos that are off-topic may be moved to a private community forum or removed without notice, particularly if they do not include a warning in the title or do not have a personal connection.<br />
<br />
9. Posts that discuss illegal activities, transactions, or websites such as warez, cracks, etc. will be removed. This includes the posting of information that you have obtained illegally.</div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Car-Seat.Org Guidelines Continued</b><br />
10. Controversial discussions are restricted on this website to post content in the Senior Community Member forum and may be locked, censored or removed at moderator discretion.  In addition, certain topics are not allowed at all, based on a history of personal attacks and hatred resulting from these discussions.  <u>Debates and threads on abortion, circumcision, religion and politics will generally be removed without warning.</u>  In some cases, where these topics crossover to other parenting or relevant/newsworthy discussions, they may be locked to allow for a brief discussion or to permit an answer to be sent to the original poster by private message.  Likewise, political and religious sentiments should be kept out of profiles, signatures, avatars and other content.  Please read the relevant sticky posts in the Community Member forums before participating there.  Abusive, mean or hateful posts or private messages directed at other members will result in infractions, negative feedback and ultimately a ban from the community member forums or all of Car-Seat.Org.<br />
<br />
Please do not quote or otherwise copy any content (except for your own) from a &quot;more private&quot;community forum to a &quot;less private&quot; or public forum, unless you have received permission from the author first.  For example, if someone has posted a comment in our Senior Community Member forum, you would discuss it there, and not quote or re-post it to our Community Member Chat forum.  Similarly, something another member submitted to our Community Member forum should not be copied to the Carseat Chat forum.  Copying any information from anywhere on Car-Seat.Org to another website or other media without permission from the author is strictly prohibited by our Terms of Service and relevant Copyright laws.<br />
<br />
11. Do not post copyrighted materials (articles, videos, audio, etc.) that you do not have permission to reproduce or distribute. For text articles, most of the time you may quote a small portion of the article (usually no more than 1/5 or 1/6) and you must link to the source (if online) or provide the source (if offline). Posting the entire article, even with the source, constitutes copyright infringement. This is not the place to illegally trade or distribute copyrighted (or those with questionable copyright status) video or audio clips.<br />
<br />
12. When posting and linking to images, videos, files, etc., please refrain from hotlinking. This is the direct linking to images (.jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, etc.), video (.avi, .mov, .mpg, .mpeg, .wmv, etc.), audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.), archives (.zip, .rar, etc.) or otherwise downloadable or streamable files, on servers that you do not have permission to link to, instead of linking to the page where the item can be found. This includes providing a direct link to the file, even if that file is not embedded into your post. This practice costs the server owner money and resources.<br />
<br />
13. Respect is the name of the game. You must respect your fellow members. Please refrain from inflammatory and defamatory comments as well as flaming, taunting, and general disrespect. Do not simply put down the opinion or advice given by others. If you don't agree with it, say why - respectfully. Don't just tell them they're wrong. Do not make uninvited remarks about typos, duplicate posts, posting styles, etc.  Car-Seat.Org does not condone any type of forum gossip or rumours pertaining to other members in public or private areas of the forum.<br />
<br />
When an opinion-based discussion is being had, do not state things like &amp;quot;there is no argument&amp;quot; as if your opinion is the only one or the only one that matters. When someone has clearly stated their opinion, do not say things like &quot;Are you serious?&quot; and &amp;quot;Are you kidding me?&amp;quot; Remember, this is not a debate club. This is a friendly discussion community with the primary goal of child passenger safety education. Allow people to have their opinion. No one is to act as some sort of opinion judge, responding to each one to say whether they agree with it or not or whether or not it is a valid, well thought out opinion.<br />
<br />
In particular, a history of posts that routinely adopt a &amp;quot;devil's advocate&amp;quot; or otherwise critical, argumentative or superior tone will ultimately be treated the same as bullying or trolling, as we have no way to distinguish between them.  As mentioned above, please respect other members.  Most times, a supportive comment is far more appreciated than &amp;quot;tough love&amp;quot; or blunt, contradictory responses.  Both what you say and how you say it is essential to maintaining access to our community forums.  This is a place for friendly exchanges, not combative ones.  The moderators reserve the right to remove community access from any member who is deemed to be disruptive or antagonistic in general, at our sole discretion.<br />
<br />
14. Signatures are limited to a certain number of lines of text, based on your usergroup. This includes blank lines.  Small images are permitted at moderator's discretion.  Signatures should not exceed 240 pixels in height, including all text and stacked images.  The text in the signature may be customized by the BBCode in use on the forums. It is recommended that you stick with readable fonts and colors and that the size is not too large. You may mention personal or non-profit websites and ventures that you are in some way related to, as long as they are otherwise appropriate for this community. Focus on things that you like, not things that you don't.  This thread on <a href="http://[URL=http://[URL]http://www.car-seat.org/showthread.php?t=41506" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2F%5BURL%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2F%5BURL%5Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D41506&amp;hash=4672a6c6fe0b7fb94277e31b954ec871" rel="noopener">signature content</a> has more details.<br />
<br />
15. Each user is allowed to create one account. If you would like to change your username, please contact us and, most likely, we can do it for you while you can keep all of your profile data, posts, and other content.  We may institute bans for suspected multiple accounts or repeated posting from members as an unregistered guest.  If you do post when not logged in, please simply identify your normal username in your post.<br />
<br />
16. Automated account creation, participation, and content scraping is not permitted.<br />
<br />
17. We know that people will have to leave our community (of their own free will or otherwise) from time to time and to that end, we generally do not delete accounts, posts, or other content posted on our community. All content is granted to us with perpetual electronic publishing rights because any content posted on this community becomes a part of the community, even if you no longer are. You may request an item to be removed at any time, but we will decide when and if to remove content from our community. If you wish to no longer be identified with our community, we will be glad to suspend your account and alter your profile information to remove all identifying characteristics.   Account suspensions are permanent.<br />
<br />
18. Moderators and the Admins have the final say on anything. While we try to be uniform and fair in our interpretations of the guidelines, this is not always possible among all the different moderators.  If you have a problem, you may make a complaint to them directly and not publicly on the website. Creating threads or posts that question or reference administrative decisions or potential administrative decisions, such as post removals, infractions, negative feedback or thread closures, is not permitted.<br />
<br />
The moderator staff are all volunteers who give our time to keep kids safe.  We are certainly not perfect and do make mistakes.  If you feel that we have made a mistake, please privately contact a staff member and we will review the situation. If you would like a copy of your removed post so that you can adjust it and repost, please use the Report Post feature or contact us via Private message. As long as we wouldn't prefer you to simply start over, we will usually be able to send you a copy.  General feedback may be submitted on the Announcement and Feedback forum.  We do not always respond to or act upon suggestions.<br />
<br />
19. Admins and Moderators may contact you by Private Message or through our &amp;quot;Infraction&amp;quot; system in response to an issue with our guidelines and rules.  Usually, these are just polite reminders.  Please be curteous with our staff.  If you have any issues with any staff member, please send a Private Message to Admin.  Our staff are volunteers and any form of public criticism or abusive language about them or their actions on forum policies will simply not be tolerated.<br />
<br />
20. Whenever you are participating in this community, please keep in mind that we strive to create a fun, friendly and inviting atmosphere. So, please have fun and enjoy the forums!<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE:<br />
<br />
Freedom of speech rights do not extend to privately owned websites, such as this one. These guidelines detail the types of behavior and activities that are allowed here.We reserve the right to suspend any account and to edit or remove any content without warning. These guidelines are subject to change at any time without notice.<br />
<br />
Do you have a question about our User Guidelines or anything else? Do you have a suggestion? Do you want to offer some feedback? Or are you experiencing some trouble with the site? Well, no matter what it is, please do not hesitate to contact us: <a href="https://www.car-seat.org/misc/contact" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.car-seat.org%2Fmisc%2Fcontact&amp;hash=a23ae5570f1cd32440d9c650334ef97c">https://www.car-seat.org/misc/contact</a><br />
