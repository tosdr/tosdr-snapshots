                        rights. By transmitting your personal information, you consent to our storing, saving and processing
                        your data outside the EEA.

                        can also use your right to data transfer in accordance with Article 20 GDPR to obtain your data in a
                        common machine-readable format. If you would like a copy of the information stored about you, you

                        transmission on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You can recognize
                        the use of this data transmission security by the small lock symbol at the top left of the browser

                                paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files
                                placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information
                                generated by the cookie about your use of the website, such as browser type / version,

                                Google server in the U.S. and stored there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as
                                part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We have also added the
                                code “anonymizeIP” to Google Analytics on this website. This guarantees the masking of your
                                IP address so that all data is collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases the full IP
                                address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened
                                there.

                                        IP address anonymization has been developed by Google to enable this website to
                                        comply with applicable data protection laws and the recommendations of local data
                                        protection authorities when they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. If you
                                        use Google Analyitcs for your magazines or your account, anonymous data will also be
                                        transmitted to you. IP anonymization or masking takes place as soon as the IP
                                        addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before
                                        the data is stored or processed. More information on IP anonymization can be found

                        GTM is a solution that allows marketers to manage website tags through a single interface. The tool
                        Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a domain without cookies. The tool triggers other
                        tags that may themselves collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation
                        has been made at the domain or cookie level, it will persist for all tracking tags implemented with
                        Google Tag Manager.
                        The IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Tag Manager will not be merged with any
                        other data held by Google. We have also set Google Tag Manager to transmit your data anonymously to
                        Google for this website. This guarantees the masking of your IP address so that all data is
                        collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is transmitted to a Google
                        server in the USA and shortened there.

                        including symbols of the respective providers of the social networks supported by our website.

                        After you have successfully logged in, the social network will tell you which data (name and e-mail
                        address) will be transmitted to us for authentication as part of the registration or login process.
                        If you have agreed to this data transfer, the fields required by us for registration will be filled
