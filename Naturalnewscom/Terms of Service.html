You acknowledge and agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary,
any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, or relating to, your
use of the NaturalNews Network or the WEBSITE must be filed within one (1) year
after such claim or cause of action arises, or forever be barred.<p>
<b>12. FAIR USE</b> <br />
The NaturalNews Network publishes excerpts and summaries from copyrighted works
under Fair Use, which allows the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of
commentary and criticism for the public interest. NaturalNews transforms summaries
of the original copyrighted work into a new format and adds new information and
value in the form of commentary or criticism.<p>
NaturalNews has no intention to compete with the original copyrighted content.
Rather, it is NaturalNews's intention to promote such content and deliver readers
to such content. Accordingly, when NaturalNews cites a copyrighted work for commentary
or criticism, NaturalNews acknowledges the original source and places a clickable
link that offers users the opportunity to click directly to the original source
of such information. The original publishers benefit from such links in terms
of delivered audience, attention and potential advertising revenues, for which
NaturalNews requests absolutely no payment or consideration.<p>
<b>13. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS</b> <br />
It is the policy of the NaturalNews Network to respond expeditiously to claims
of intellectual property infringement. NaturalNews will promptly process and
investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) and other applicable
intellectual property laws. Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially
complying with the DMCA, the NaturalNews Network will act expeditiously to remove
or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the
subject of infringing activity and will act expeditiously to remove or disable
access to any reference or link to material or activity that is claimed to be
infringing. The NaturalNews Network will terminate access for subscribers and
account holders who are repeat infringers. Notices of claimed infringement should
be directed to:

<blockquote><p>
