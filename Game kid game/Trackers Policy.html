<H1>Cookie Policy</H1>

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

<p>This website uses the following cookies:
</p>
<p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3> 
  <p>This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.</p>
    <p>For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.</p>
<h3>DoubleClick</h3> 

<p>DoubleClick uses cookies to improve advertising. Some common applications are to target advertising based on what’s relevant to a user, to improve reporting on campaign performance, and to avoid showing ads the user has already seen.</p>

<p>The cookie ID in each DoubleClick cookie is essential to these applications. For example, DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to keep a log of which ads show to which browsers. When it’s time to serve an ad to a browser, DoubleClick can use the browser’s cookie ID to check which DoubleClick ads have already been delivered to that particular browser. That’s how DoubleClick avoids showing ads the user has already seen. In the same way, cookie IDs allow DoubleClick to log conversions related to ad requests—such as when a user views a DoubleClick ad and later uses the same browser to visit the advertiser’s website and make a purchase.</p>
<p>DoubleClick cookies contain no personally identifiable information. Sometimes the cookie contains an additional identifier that is similar in appearance to the cookie ID. This identifier is used to identify an ad campaign to which a user was exposed previously; but no personally identifiable information is stored by DoubleClick in the cookie. </p>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
<p>If a user opts out using the <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">Ads Settings </a>, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the user’s browser is overwritten with the phrase “OPT_OUT”. Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can’t be associated with a particular browser. </p>

<h3>Flash Cookies</h3>
<p>Some Flash games may use Flash Cookies for more information please: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html "> Click Here </a> </p>

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ ">www.allaboutcookies.org.</a></p>
