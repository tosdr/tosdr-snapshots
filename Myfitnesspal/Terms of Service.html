<h3 id="72-termination-or-cancellation-of-premium-services">7.2 Termination or Cancellation of Premium Services</h3>
<p>If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium

Once you have cancelled your Premium Service and received confirmation,
no other changes can be made to your account. The cancellation of a
Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing
cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Premium Service
through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are
billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be
charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the
Premium Service through the end of that month.</p>
<p>There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium
Service. If you no longer wish to subscribe to a Premium Service, it is
your responsibility to cancel your Premium Service in due time,
regardless of whether or not you actively use the Premium Service.</p>
<h3 id="73-fee-changes">7.3 Fee Changes</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change our
prices for Premium Services at any time. We will give you reasonable
notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or
through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email
notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel
the applicable Premium Service prior to the change going into effect.</p>
<h3 id="74-discount-coupon-or-gift-codes">7.4 Discount, Coupon or Gift Codes</h3>
<p>If you have received a discount, coupon or gift code to a Premium
Service, the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the
terms and conditions of the specific code. To redeem a discount or
coupon code, log in to MyFitnessPal and enter the applicable code to
take advantage of the relevant promotion. All discounts, gift and coupon
codes can only be applied when subscribing to Premium Services, and to
accounts not already subscribed to Premium Services. Discount, coupon
and gift codes cannot be combined with any other sales, promotion or
coupon, and cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced or redeemed for cash
or payment of accounts. A payment method may be required to redeem a
discount or coupon code. It is your own responsibility to use a
discount, coupon or gift code before it expires, and expired codes
cannot be refunded or extended. It is also your responsibility to
terminate the Premium Service before the end of a free or discounted
period if you do not want to continue with a Premium Service at the
regular price. The terms and conditions of a specific discount, coupon
or gift code may include additional restrictions on its use, including
but not limited to the type of plan, duration of free or discounted
Premium Service, coupon validity dates, and/or purchase quantities.
MyFitnessPal reserves the right to cancel discounts and coupon
promotions at any time.</p>
<h3 id="75-free-trials">7.5 Free Trials</h3>
<p>We sometimes offer free trials of our Premium Services or other
promotional offers (each a <strong>“Free Trial”</strong>). A Free Trial provides you
access to the Premium Services for a period of time, with details
specified when you sign up for the offer.</p>
<p>In order to sign up for a Free Trial, you may need to provide us with
your preferred Payment Method. As soon as you submit your payment
details, your Free Trial will begin. You will not be charged until the
Free Trial period ends.</p>
<p><strong>Unless you cancel before the end of the Free Trial, or unless
otherwise stated, your access to the Premium Service will automatically
continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for that Premium
Service using the Payment Method you provided.</strong> All incurred charges
are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in
accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service. We may send
you a reminder when your Free Trial is about to end, but we do not
guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility
to know when the Free Trial will end if you decide you do not want to
become a paying Premium Services user after the Free Trial period.</p>
<p>If you decide you do not want to become a paying Premium Services user,
you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Free Trial
period. Depending on the applicable Premium Service, you may lose access
as soon as you cancel or at the end of the Free Trial period. Once you
have cancelled your Free Trial and received confirmation, you cannot
resume the Free Trial period even if it was not used for the entire
duration of the offer.</p>
<p>Premium Service features and content may change at any time, and we
cannot guarantee any specific feature or content will be available for
the entire Free Trial period. The rates in effect when you sign up for
the Free Trial will be the same when the Free Trial ends, unless we
notify you otherwise. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion,
to modify or terminate any Free Trial offer, your access to the Premium
Services during the Free Trial, or any of these terms without notice and
with no liability. You may not sign up for more than one Free Trial of a
given Premium Service at the same time, and we reserve the right to
limit your ability to take advantage of multiple Free Trials.</p>

received consent from your physician to participate in the Programs, or
any of the related activities made available to you in connection with
the Services. Further, you agree, represent and warrant that you have
consulted with your physician before making any dietary changes based
upon information available through the Services. Everyone’s condition
and abilities are different, and participating in the Programs and other
activities promoted by our Services is at your own risk. If you choose
to participate in the Programs and these activities, you do so of your
own free will and accord, knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks
associated with such activities. The Programs and other activities
promoted by the Services may pose risks even to those who are currently
in good health.</p>
<p>You expressly agree that your athletic activities, which may generate
the User-Generated Content you post or seek to post on or via the
Services (e.g., workouts exercises, etc.) carry certain inherent and
significant risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death and that
you voluntarily assume all known and unknown risks associated with these
activities.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, and to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible or liable, either
directly or indirectly, for any injury, illness, or damages sustained
from your use of, or inability to use, any Services or features of the
Services, including any Content or activities you access or learn about
through our Services even if caused in whole or part by the action,
inaction or negligence of MyFitnessPal or others.</p>

<p>We make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy,

the Services, and we make no commitment to update such Content.</p>
<p>In addition, User-Generated Content, including advice, statements, or
other information, including, without limitation, food, nutrition,
dietary guidance, exercise or training guidance, athletic activities,

should not be relied on without independent verification. User-Generated
Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole
responsibility of the user from whom such User-Generated Content
originated. All information is provided “as is” without any
representation, warranty or condition as to its accuracy or reliability.</p>
<p>In particular, MyFitnessPal’s food database (<strong>“Food Database”</strong>)
contains a combination of nutritional information entered by
MyFitnessPal and MyFitnessPal members. Any user of the Services can
contribute to or edit nutritional information in the Food Database.
Please be advised that nutritional information in the Food Database has
not been reviewed by persons with the expertise required to provide you
with complete, accurate, or reliable information. MyFitnessPal does not
(i) guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any

MyFitnessPal has no and assumes no obligation to verify that users who
identify themselves as licensed trainers or dieticians are actually
licensed. If you hold yourself out as a licensed trainer or dietician,
you represent and warrant that you are actually licensed for the
services you provide in the jurisdiction in which you offer your
services. Users should also bear in mind that even if a user is a
licensed trainer in one jurisdiction that does not mean the trainer user
is licensed in the jurisdiction from which other users access the
trainer user’s advice. Accordingly, relying on any advice provided by
other users is at your own risk. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, under no circumstances will MyFitnessPal be responsible or liable

<p>Any and all services provided by, in and/or through the Services

only. MyFitnessPal is not a medical professional, and MyFitnessPal does
not provide medical services or render medical advice. Nothing contained
in the Services should be construed as such advice or diagnosis. The
information and reports generated by us should not be interpreted as a
substitute for physician consultation, evaluation, or treatment, and the
information made available on or through the Services should not be
relied upon when making medical decisions, or to diagnose or treat a
health condition or illness. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT CREATE A
DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND MYFITNESSPAL.</p>
<p>You should seek the advice of a physician or a medical professional with
any questions you may have regarding your health before beginning any
dietary programs or plans, exercise regimen or any other fitness or
wellness activities or plans that may be referenced, discussed or
offered under the Services. If you are being treated for a health
condition or illness, taking prescription medication or following a
therapeutic diet to treat a disease, you should consult with your
physician before using the Services. You represent to us (which
representation shall be deemed to be made each time you use the
Services), that you are not using the Services or participating in any
of the activities offered by the Services for purpose of seeking medical
attention. You further agree that, before using the Services, you will
consult your physician, particularly if you are at risk for problems
resulting from exercise or changes in your diet. If any information you
receive or obtain from using the Services is inconsistent with the
medical advice from your physician, you should follow the advice of your
physician.</p>
<p>The Premium Services provide you access to certain specialized
Content—namely coaching and guidance on fitness regimens and meal
planning (“<strong>Plans</strong>”). The Plans are not a medical or any other type of
health service. No diagnosis or treatment of, or advice regarding, any
dietary or health condition is delivered by the Plans. The Plans are not
a substitute for, and are not an alternative to healthcare diagnosis and
treatment when a dietary or health condition or illness is present. You
should seek diagnosis, treatment and advice regarding dietary or health
conditions or illnesses from physicians practicing medicine and other
licensed healthcare professionals. Under no circumstances will any of
your interactions with our Plans be deemed or construed to create a
physician-patient relationship or a fiduciary duty of any kind
whatsoever. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE
PLANS.</p>

you to support your wellness and fitness activities. Some of the
Services are aimed at tracking your physical movements and sleep
activity (<strong>“Activity Tracking Services”</strong>). These Activity Tracking
Services rely on sensors and/or GPS functionality that track your
movement or body at rest. The data and information provided by the
Activity Tracking Services are intended to be a representation of your
activity, but may not be completely accurate, including with respect to
step, sleep, distance, or calorie data. By using Activity Tracking
Services, you acknowledge and agree that MyFitnessPal is not responsible
or liable for any inaccuracy in such data.</p>

effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of the
Terms. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use
the Services. In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement
to a modified version of the Terms, the modified version of the Terms
will become effective as of the date specified in the Terms. Your choice
to maintain an account, access or use the Services (regardless of
whether you create an account with us) following that date constitutes

Content; User-Generated Content, in particular, is provided by and is
solely the responsibility of the users providing that Content. No advice
or information, whether oral or written, obtained from other users or
through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made
herein. You therefore expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the

have failed its essential purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, the total liability of MyFitnessPal, for any claim under
these Terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the
greater of five hundred dollars (us $500.00) or the amount you paid us

<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree
that we offer the Services and set the Services’ prices in reliance upon
the warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability set
forth in the Terms, that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and
limitations of liability reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of
risk between you and form an essential basis of the bargain between you

<p><strong>If you are a resident of California:</strong> You waive your rights with
respect to California Civil Code Section 1542, which says “a general

<p><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<p>YOU AND MYFITNESSPAL AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (A “DISPUTE”) TO BINDING
ARBITRATION. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and
MyFitnessPal agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to your
use of the Services (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) will be resolved by binding
arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the
United States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and
enforcement of this arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). In
arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a
judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the
arbitrator&#39;s decision is subject to limited review by courts. The
arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
as a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and
declaratory relief. Judgment on the arbitrator&#39;s award may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. Such dispute resolution
proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a
class, consolidated or representative action. Except where prohibited,
you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of
Disputes relating to your general use of the Services under the Consumer
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Please

arbitration.</p>
<p>Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be
conducted remotely as provided below.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and
impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator will decide all issues
relating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application
of this Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of
arbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or
illusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms, except that a
court may resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability
of the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. The
term &quot;Dispute&quot; and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly
interpreted.</p>
<p>Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are
intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the
costs and burdens for everyone involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be
solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be
chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the
parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by
the parties; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or
her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in
the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to
the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be
permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of
the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing
and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition
of any claim.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute
with us arising out of or relating to your choice to maintain an
account, access or use the Services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a
private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity,
or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any
lawsuit involving any such dispute; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose
or it is forever barred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
governed by the American Arbitration Association’s rules. MyFitnessPal
will reimburse you for those fees up to $5,000, unless the arbitrator
determines your claims are frivolous. Likewise, MyFitnessPal will not
seek attorneys&#39; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator
determines your claims are frivolous.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT,
YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF
YOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE
EARLIER OF: (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU
FIRST AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH MYFITNESS PAL THAT
CONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. The opt-out notice must be

agree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address,

opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly

an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore,
this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFitnessPal from

temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or
conservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state
or federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible
violation of MyFitnessPal’s intellectual property rights.</p>

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT CREATE A\nDOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND MYFITNESSPAL.\n\nYou should seek the advice of a physician or a medical professional with\nany questions you may have regarding your health before beginning any\ndietary programs or plans, exercise regimen or any other fitness or\nwellness activities or plans that may be referenced, discussed or\noffered under the Services.

The Plans are not a medical or any other type of\nhealth service. No diagnosis or treatment of, or advice regarding, any\ndietary or health condition is delivered by the Plans. The Plans are not\na substitute for, and are not an alternative to healthcare diagnosis and\ntreatment when a dietary or health condition or illness is present.

THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON\nAN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS. Without limiting\nthe foregoing, you understand that, to the maximum extent permitted by\napplicable law, we make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy,\ntimeliness, truthfulness, completeness, availability, or reliability of\nany of the Services or any Content.

No advice\nor information, whether oral or written, obtained from other users or\nthrough the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made\nherein. You therefore expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the\nServices is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to\nsatisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.\n\n## 11. Limitation of Liability\n\n_We are building the best Services we can for you but we can't promise\nthey will be perfect. We're not liable for various things that could go\nwrong as a result of your use of the Services._\n\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no\ncircumstances (including, without limitation, negligence) shall\nMyFitnessPal, its subsidiaries, partners or any wireless carriers be\nliable to you or any third party for (a) any indirect, incidental,\nspecial, reliance, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages of any\nkind whatsoever; (b) loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or\nother intangible losses; (c) damages relating to your access to, use of,\nor inability to access or use the Services; (d) damages relating to any\nconduct or Content of any third party or user of the Services, including\nwithout limitation, defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct or content;\nand/or (e) damages in any manner relating to any Third-Party Content or\nThird-party Products accessed or used via the Services.

We would not be able to provide the Services to you on an\neconomically reasonable basis without these warranty disclaimers,\nreleases, and limitations of liability.\n\n**If you are a resident of California:** You waive your rights with\nrespect to California Civil Code Section 1542, which says “a general\nrelease does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or\nsuspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release,\nwhich, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with\nthe debtor.”\n\n**If you are a resident of New Jersey:** Notwithstanding anything herein\nto the contrary, nothing in these Terms limits or excludes our\nresponsibility for losses or damages caused by MyFitnessPal’s own fraud,\nrecklessness, gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n## 12. Indemnification\n\n**If you are a resident of the United States or any location other than\nFrance or Germany:** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,\nyou agree to indemnify and hold MyFitnessPal, its affiliates and\npartners harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable\naccounting and attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or\narising out of (a) the User-Generated Content you access or share\nthrough the Services; (b) your use of the Services, (c) your activities\nin connection with the Services, (d) your connection to the Services,\n(e) your violation of these Terms, (f) your use or misuse of any user’s\nPersonal Data, (g) any violation of the rights of any other person or\nentity by you, or (h) your employment of the Services to meet another\nuser in person.

Disputes and Arbitration, Class Action Waiver, Jurisdiction and Venue\n\nIf you are a resident of the United States:\n\n**Arbitration Agreement**\n\nYOU AND MYFITNESSPAL AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF\nOR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (A “DISPUTE”) TO BINDING\nARBITRATION. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and\nMyFitnessPal agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to your\nuse of the Services (a “**Dispute**”) will be resolved by binding\narbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the\nUnited States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and\nenforcement of this arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). In\narbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a\njudge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the\narbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. The\narbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief\nas a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and\ndeclaratory relief. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in\nany court having jurisdiction thereof. Such dispute resolution\nproceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a\nclass, consolidated or representative action. Except where prohibited,\nyou and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of\nDisputes relating to your general use of the Services under the Consumer\nArbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Please\nvisit [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) for more information about\narbitration.\n\nAny arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be\nconducted remotely as provided below.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and\nimpartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association. The arbitrator will decide all issues\nrelating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application\nof this Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of\narbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or\nillusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms, except that a\ncourt may resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability\nof the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. The\nterm \"Dispute\" and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly\ninterpreted.\n\nBoth you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are\nintended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the\ncosts and burdens for everyone involved:\n\n- the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be\n  solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be\n  chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;\n\n- the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the\n  parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by\n  the parties; and\n\n- any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered\n  in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nBarring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or\nher decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.\nThe arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in\nthe interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to\nthe public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be\npermanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of\nthe arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing\nand will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition\nof any claim.\n\nYou also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute\nwith us arising out of or relating to your choice to maintain an\naccount, access or use the Services:\n\n- You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;\n\n- You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a\n  private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity,\n  or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any\n  lawsuit involving any such dispute; and\n\n- You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose\n  or it is forever barred.\n\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be\ngoverned by the American Arbitration Association’s rules. MyFitnessPal\nwill reimburse you for those fees up to \\$5,000, unless the arbitrator\ndetermines your claims are frivolous. Likewise, MyFitnessPal will not\nseek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator\ndetermines your claims are frivolous.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT,\nYOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF\nYOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE\nEARLIER OF: (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU\nFIRST AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH MYFITNESS PAL THAT\nCONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. The opt-out notice must be\npostmarked no later than the applicable deadline and emailed to:\nlegal@myfitnesspal.com. The opt-out notice must state that you do not\nagree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address,\nphone number and email address. This procedure is the only way you can\nopt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly\nwith this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will\nrender the opt-out notice null and void. If you opt out of the\narbitration provision, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement\nwill continue to apply.\n\nIf this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all\ndisputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the\njurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New\nYork, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and\nvenue of these courts. You and MyFitnessPal agree that if for any reason\na Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and\nMyFitnessPal waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will\nproceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis;\nand (3) neither you nor MyFitnessPal may be a class representative or\nclass member or otherwise participate in any class, representative,\nconsolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.\n\nThis agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFitnessPal from\nseeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without\nlimitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm\nan arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore,\nthis agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFitnessPal from\n(i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or\nconservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state\nor federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible\nviolation of MyFitnessPal’s intellectual property rights.\n\n**If you are a resident of the European Union**: Notwithstanding\nanything in these Terms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you\nand MyFitnessPal cannot resolve, you have the right to submit a\ncomplaint through \u003chttp://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr\u003e. Other than as set\nout in these Terms, we do not participate in any ADR scheme.\n\n- In addition, nothing in these Terms limits your rights to bring an\n  action against MyFitnessPal in the local courts of your place of\n  domicile. All disputes arising under the Terms between you and\n  MyFitnessPal will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of\n  the courts located in your place of domicile, or the courts located\n  in the Netherlands, and you and we hereby submit to the personal\n  jurisdiction and venue of these courts.\n\n**If you are a resident of Finland:** Notwithstanding anything in these\nTerms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and MyFitnessPal\ncannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint to the\nlocal [Consumer Disputes Board](https://www.kuluttajariita.fi/fi/) or\nother corresponding body.\n\n**If you are a resident of Denmark:** Notwithstanding anything in these\nTerms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and MyFitnessPal\ncannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint to the Danish\nCompetition and Consumer Authority (Konkurrence- og Forbrugerstyrelsen,\nCenter for Klageløsning, Carl Jacobsens Vej 35, 2500 Valby,\nmail: \u003ccfk@kfst.dk\u003e).\n\n**If you are a resident of South Korea:** Notwithstanding anything in\nthese Terms to the contrary, nothing in these Terms limits your rights\nto bring an action against MyFitnessPal in the local courts of your\nplace of domicile.\n\n## 15.

People on low-carb and Keto plans often like to track “net carbs” instead of “total carbs” so Premium includes an optional setting called Net Carbs Mode which only tracks the carbs that add calories. This means that the carbs from fiber and sugar alcohols are subtracted automatically.
