<p><strong>Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain.</strong> Transactions involving our NFTs will be conducted on the relevant Protocol. Information about your transfers will be provided to the blockchain and may be accessible to third parties due to the public nature of the blockchain. Because entries to the blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you. Please note that once your information is uploaded onto or otherwise recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be deleted.</p>

Once your personal information has been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application, it will also be subject to such third party’s privacy policy. We encourage you to closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party websites’ or the third­-party applications’ processing of your personal information.</p>
