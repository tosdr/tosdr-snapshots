	<li><strong>How We Share This Information</strong>
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>
		<p>Yahoo shares information within its affiliated brands and companies. We also share information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to provide Services that you have requested (including when you connect with <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html">third-party apps and widgets</a>). We do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Yahoo unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>

		<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>
			<p><strong>With Your Consent. </strong>We will share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Yahoo when we have your consent. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Within Yahoo. </strong>Information may also be shared within Yahoo, including with other Yahoo Services and affiliates. Yahoo affiliates may use the information in a manner consistent with their privacy policies.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>With Partners. </strong>We may share your information with nonaffiliated companies who are:</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>
				<p><strong>Trusted Partners. </strong>We provide user information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo based on our directions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality measures.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><strong>Advertising, Analytics and Business Partners (Limited to Non-Personally Identifiable Information). </strong>We may share aggregated or pseudonymous information (including demographic information) with partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps, or <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html">other companies</a>. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed or report how many people installed an app after seeing a promotion. We do not share personally identifiable information (like phone number or email address) with these partners, such as publishers, advertisers, ad agencies, or analytics partners.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>When you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with our Services, they may collect information about your activities subject to their own terms and privacy policies. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>We allow <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html">other companies</a> that show advertisements on our webpages or apps to collect information from your browsers or devices. Other companies' use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
				</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>For Legal and Other Purposes. </strong>We may access, preserve and disclose information to investigate, prevent, or take action in connection with: (i) legal process and legal requests; (ii) enforcement of the <a href="/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html">Terms</a>; (iii) claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (iv) requests for customer service; (v) technical issues; (vi) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of Yahoo, its users or the public; (vii) establishing or exercising our legal rights or defending against legal claims; or (viii) as otherwise required by law.</p>

	<li><strong>Information Security and Data Retention</strong>
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>
		<p>Yahoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Yahoo will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the applicable Yahoo Services to you. In some cases, Yahoo has certain business or legal requirements that result in an obligation to retain your personal information for an extended period of time. These obligations may include financial record keeping, ensuring continuity of our products or services, security, fraud, and abuse prevention, or compliance with our legal obligations. In some limited cases, we may keep data for longer than needed for the purposes set out in the <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/dashboard/index.html">Yahoo Privacy Dashboard</a>, such as: (i) replicating or backing up certain data to “offline” storage for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) truncating, redacting or summarizing raw data, log files and database records into statistical aggregate data or probabilistic data structures to understand long term trends; (iii) maintaining de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development (in these cases, unique identifiers and linkages to existing data about you are broken or removed so that this data is no longer associated with you, your browser, or device); or (iv) keeping and using certain data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements (for example, we might keep data associated with an account subject to litigation or a request from law enforcement).

	<li><strong>Protecting Children’s Privacy</strong>
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>
		<p>Our Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under age 13 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account.

		</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Our Legal Bases for Processing Information.</strong> We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Yahoo may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/legalbases/index.html">Legal bases</a> page for more information.</p>

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>

Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Yahoo processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK and transfers that information from the EU/EEA/UK through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the European Commission’sA Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our Services, you consent to us transferring information about you to these countries. For more information, please visit our <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/datatransfer/index.html">Data Transfer</a> page.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.</p>
		</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><strong>Other Important Information</strong>
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>
		<p><strong>This Privacy Policy Applies Only to Yahoo. </strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. </p>

	<li><strong>Changes</strong>
