We strive to provide a secure and reliable service, do not seek to absolve ourselves from any legal responsibilities related to the operation of our service, and are committed to addressing any issues that may arise in a fair and lawful manner.

The law&apos;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more</span><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">here</a>.</p><p>According to CalOPPA: users can visit our site anonymously; we link to this Privacy Policy on the home page; and our Privacy Policy link includes the word &apos;Privacy&apos;, and can be easily be found on the home page.</p><p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on this Privacy Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information by logging into their account or by emailing us. Should CodeCombat need to terminate a user account, we will attempt to forewarn the user via the email address on file.</p><p><strong>FERPA</strong></p><p>Our collection, use, and disclosure of student data is governed by this privacy policy, any other agreement with an educational agency, the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), COPPA, and applicable state laws which relate to the collection of student data. See the rest of this privacy policy for other details on the limited ways in which we handle student data.</p><p><strong>SOPIPA</strong></p><p>CodeCombat is compliant with SOPIPA, meeting, among others, these requirements. We:</p><ol><li>do not use any data collected via the service to target ads to students;</li><li>do not create advertising profiles on students;</li><li>do not sell student information;</li><li>do not disclose personal information, unless required by law or as part of the maintenance and development of the service;</li><li>do use sound information security, including encryption of data and other industry-standard practices;</li><li>will delete data that we have collected from students in a school when the school or district requests it;</li><li>share information only with educational researchers or with educational agencies performing a function for the school;</li><li>innovate safely without compromising student privacy by only using de-identified and aggregated data to develop and improve the service.</li></ol><p><strong>AB 1584</strong></p><p>CodeCombat is compliant with AB 1584. For our classroom version, pupil records continue to be the property of and under the control of the local educational agency. Pupils may retain possession and control of their own pupil-generated content by editing or deleting their content from our servers themselves via the website or by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d3a7b6b2be93b0bcb7b6b0bcbeb1b2a7fdb0bcbe">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Pupils may also request to transfer their pupil-generated content to a personal account. Third parties will not have access to any personally identifiable information in the pupil record for any purpose. Parents, legal guardians, and eligible pupils may review their information and request corrections to erroneous information through account settings on our website or by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d3a7b6b2be93b0bcb7b6b0bcbeb1b2a7fdb0bcbe">[email&#160;protected]</a>. We take actions to ensure the security and confidentiality of pupil records, including but not limited to designating and training responsible individuals on ensuring the security and confidentiality of pupil records, by using current, commercially reasonable methods. In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of a pupil&apos;s records, CodeCombat shall report to an affected parent, legal guardian, or eligible pupil pursuant via email (if provided). CodeCombat shall not use any information in a pupil record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by this privacy policy. CodeCombat will not use pupil records to engage in targeted advertising. A pupil&apos;s records shall not be retained or available to CodeCombat past the terms of any contract with a local educational agency, except for a case where a pupil chooses to establish or maintain an account with CodeCombat for the purpose of storing pupil-generated content, either by retaining possession and control of their own pupil-generated content, or by transferring pupil-generated content to a personal account.</p><p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p><p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation&apos;s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&apos;s privacy and safety online.</p><p>We adhere to the following COPPA tenets:</p><ul><li>We will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to particapate in our service.</li><li>Teachers and parents can agree to the collection and use of their students&apos; information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties.</li><li>Teachers and parents can review, delete, and manage their students&apos; information through account settings on our website or by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c28393d311c3f3338393f33313e3d28723f3331">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</li><li>We notify teachers and parents directly before collecting PII from their children. This includes what specific information will be collected and how it might be disclosed, a link to our online privacy policy, and how teachers and parents can give their consent.</li><li>Parents can give consent by creating accounts for their children and providing the minimum necessary personal information needed during that account creation.</li><li>Student accounts for use in school settings can only be created with consent of a teacher.</li></ul><p></p><p>In other countries with similar children&apos;s privacy laws applying to children under 13 - 16 years old per country, we follow similar consent and information security policies to protect the personal data of children.</p><p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p><p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p><p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify the affected users via email within 7 business days (or within 72 hours for certain categories of breach).</p><p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><p><strong>CAN-SPAM Act</strong></p><p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><p>We collect your email address in order to:</p><ul><li>Authenticate your user account.</li><li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li><li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li><li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service (optional).</li></ul><p></p><p>To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:</p><ul><li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li><li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li><li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li><li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if used</li><li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li><li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li></ul><p></p><p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can change your email settings in your <a href="/account/settings">account preferences</a>, email us, or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.</p><p id="student-data-processors"><strong>Student Data Processors</strong></p><p>Personal student data is collected and processed only when necessary to provide the service.

EU users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by CodeCombat within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting CodeCombat.</li><li>CodeCombat may be allowed to retain personal data for a longer period whenever an EU user has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, CodeCombat may be obliged to retain personal data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</li></ul><p>More specifically, CodeCombat will retain server log files for no more than 30 days, and will retain inactive, unpaid EU user accounts for no more than 2 years.</p><p>Once the retention period expires, personal data shall be deleted.
