    <p><b>9. The Use of Cookies and other identifiers</b>
    </p>

    <p>DealDash.com uses so-called "cookies", which are text files that are stored on
        your computer that we retrieve when you visit the site to assist in customizing
        your experience with the online service.</p>

    <p>The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for example by keeping
        track of your bids placed, auctions, etc.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to accept cookies in order to use our service properly, although
        you may always adjust the way your browser handles cookies.</p>

    <p>We would like to point out that turning off the ability of your browser to accept
        cookies may result in limited functionality.</p>

    <p>DealDash uses first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party
        cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other
        uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related
        to visits to your site and DealDash’s advertising efforts. Visitors can opt-out of Google
        Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads
        Settings.</p>

    <p>By adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device or browser, you can manage how your mobile device and
        mobile browser share information, as well as how your mobile browser handles Cookies and other tracking identifiers.
        Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn
        how to adjust your settings.
    </p>

    <p><b>10. Security Measures</b></p>

    <p>The information in your DealDash.com account and in your DealDash.com profile is
        password protected.</p>

    <p>Please do not provide your log in credentials to anyone else, as you will be liable
        for the activity in your account.</p>

    <p>DealDash.com will never ask for your password in e-mails that you receive unexpectedly
        or that you did not request.</p>

    <p>Please remember to log out of your account and to close your Internet browser window
        when you leave the DealDash.com site; this is especially important if you use
        the site through a public or shared device.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your log in details, and we assume
        no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used. Let us know immediately
        if the secrecy of your log in credentials has been compromised. While we take
        reasonable steps to protect your personal data in our control, no system is foolproof.</p>
