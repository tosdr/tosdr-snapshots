The procedures and guidelines contained below explain the auction process. The <a\n                href=\"https:\/\/www.dealdash.com\/privacy-policy\">DealDash Privacy Policy<\/a> governs the collection and\n        use of user information on the Site. The FAQ provides additional detail on how the Services work, and the House\n        Rules set out important details governing every user's rights and obligations. <\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"4\">\n        <li><strong>Contractual Obligations<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>The auction process is a method in which the Site solicits offers from buyers for the sale of lots. By submitting\n        bids, you are making a legal offer to buy the lot. Once a bid is accepted, a contract is created between the buyer\n        and the Site for the sale and purchase of the lot in accordance with the terms disclosed at the time of the auction.\n        By using the Services and bidding on a lot, or by using the 'Buy It Now' function, you agree to complete the\n        transaction as described and fulfill any and all contractual obligations.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"5\">\n        <li><strong>Access to Systems<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Services, including, without\n        limitation: (i) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which the user is\n        not authorized to access; (ii) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to\n        breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; or (iii) accessing or using the Services or\n        any portion thereof without authorization, in violation of these Terms or in violation of applicable law. <\/p>\n\n    <p>You may not use any scraper, crawler, spider, robot, or other automated means of any kind to access or copy data on\n        the Site, deep-link to any feature or content on the Site, bypass our robot exclusion headers, or other measures we\n        may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site.<\/p>\n\n    <p>You agree not to interfere with the Site, Services, or any transaction and agree not to use any device, software, or\n        routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activity being conducted\n        on or through the Services. You agree not to impose any unreasonably or disproportionately large load on DealDash's\n        systems or facilities. You agree not to put any material on the Site that contains any viruses, Trojan horses,\n        worms, time bombs, cancelbots or any other computer programming routines that may damage, interfere with,\n        surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. Violations of system or network\n        security may result in civil or criminal liability. DealDash will investigate occurrences that may involve such\n        violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in\n        such violations. <\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"6\">\n        <li><strong>Bidding<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>Each DealDash bid (a \"Bid\") is a limited, non-transferable, one-year license to place one bid on a\n        DealDash auction. Bids have no monetary value; are not credited against the purchase price of products purchased on\n        the Site; and may not be exchanged for money or any items of monetary value.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Due to the billing of charges, DealDash would like to advise all users to monitor their bidding practices. Repeated\n        online bidding can incur high costs. Users should therefore pay attention to their bidding practices.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"7\">\n        <li><strong>Fraud and Other Restricted Behavior<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>You acknowledge that in order to maintain fair and honest auctions, DealDash retains the right to monitor and enforce\n        any fraudulent or malicious activity on the Site. You acknowledge that you have read what these activities include,\n        but are not limited to, in these Terms, the \"House Rules\" policy, and you agree not to engage in any of these,\n        or any other fraudulent or malicious activities. As stated herein, DealDash reserves the right to temporarily or\n        permanently suspend any user account engaged or suspected to engage in any such activities.<\/p>\n\n    <p>You may not register and make bids under a false name or with an invalid credit card. Such fraudulent conduct is a\n        violation of federal and state laws. Fraudulent bidders may be reported to relevant state and federal law\n        enforcement agencies and DealDash will cooperate to ensure that violators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of\n        the law.<\/p>\n\n    <p>A bidder may not resell any product or service obtained through the Site and Services without prior written consent\n        from DealDash, unless it is explicitly allowed in the product description of an auction. Moreover, a user may not \n        use the products to create any investment scheme, commodities contract or pool or otherwise to use DealDash as a \n        product delivery mechanism for a brokered or 'middleman' agreement or obligation. If it is discovered that a user is, \n        in fact, reselling products obtained from DealDash, we reserve the right to suspend the account without further \n        notice, voiding all auctions in which the user has participated. Additionally, the user may be required to compensate \n        DealDash for any damages.<\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash reserves the right to refuse any order you place with us. DealDash may, in its sole discretion, limit or\n        cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by\n        or under the same customer account, the same credit card, geographic region, and\/or orders that use the same phone\n        number, billing and\/or shipping address. In the event DealDash changes or cancels an order, DealDash will attempt to\n        notify you by contacting the e-mail, billing address and\/or phone number provided at the time the order was made.\n        DealDash reserves the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in its sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers,\n        resellers, distributors and others who violate these Terms.<\/p>\n\n    <p>No user may permit or assist others to use the Services for any purpose other than that for which they are intended.\n        A user shall not permit or assist others to abuse or fraudulently use the Services, including but not limited to the\n        following:<\/p>\n\n    <ul>\n        <li>Obtaining or attempting to obtain service by any fraudulent means or device with intent to avoid payment;<\/li>\n        <li>Accessing, altering, or destroying any information of another DealDash user by any fraudulent means or device,\n            or attempting to do so; or\n        <\/li>\n        <li>Using Services so as to interfere with the use of DealDash network by other users or authorized users,\n            intentionally or not; or in violation of the law or in aid of any unlawful act.\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n\n    <p>Each user acknowledges that DealDash's network may only be used for lawful purposes.

You may register only once\n        and may only have one account at DealDash for your personal use. Additionally, each household or \"group of users\n        associated with each other\", determined by the sole discretion of DealDash, may not register or have control over\n        more than two DealDash member accounts.

The username may not offend common decency or\n        infringe upon the rights of third parties. The username may also not be misleading in any way or, in DealDash's\n        judgment, closely resemble the identity of an existing user. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all\n        the information you provide through the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree to maintain and\n        promptly update your user account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any\n        information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or DealDash has reasonable grounds to suspect\n        that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, DealDash may suspend or terminate your\n        account or access to the Services. If you abuse your user account, whether it harms a third party or DealDash, you\n        may be disqualified and, if applicable, DealDash may notify applicable authorities of the possibility of a\n        crime.<\/p>\n\n    <p>ACCOUNTS AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICES CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED OR USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT\n        HOLDER.

Examples\n        of the foregoing include, but are not limited to, (i) honoring bids of users who have not paid for the Bids, (ii)\n        the use of unauthorized bidding software, or (iii) establishing several user accounts for the same person. Moreover,\n        DealDash reserves the right to cancel unauthorized DealDash accounts or accounts that have been inactive. Each user\n        agrees not to hold DealDash responsible for any loss incurred as a result of such action.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"14\">\n        <li><strong>Bid Purchasing for Online Bidding \/ Payment<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>\n        All prices are quoted and payments processed in United States dollars. The user is responsible for conversion rates\n        and fees which may occur in case of a currency conversion done by their bank or payment processor.\n    <\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash Bids must be purchased by users prior to online bidding. Only registered users can submit the online bids,\n        which can be purchased in packages (so-called 'Bid Packs') at the currently applicable prices, which can be viewed\n        in 'My Dashboard' under 'Buy bids'. The Bids must be paid for in advance. When the Bids are purchased and deposited\n        into the user's DealDash account, a contract for the purchase of the Bids materializes. The associated invoice is\n        due immediately. If a user is suspended for whatever reason, all of their Bids will be forfeited and will not be\n        refunded.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Users who have won an auction and paid for a product are not eligible for a refund on either Bid purchases, account\n        activation fees, or product fees if their product has been shipped by the time of request.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Should a payment not be honored for a user, a returned payment fee will be charged. The user shall be solely\n        responsible for these fees. DealDash reserves the right to block access to the user account until full payment is\n        received by DealDash for the outstanding amount, including any fees due to returned payment, etc. DealDash may\n        withhold any outstanding deliveries until it receives full payment. The user's bank may or may not charge the user\n        an international payment fee in connection with a credit card payment on the DealDash site. It is the sole\n        responsibility of the user to be familiar with the policies and practices of his or her bank for such fees. DealDash\n        holds no responsibility for additional payment fees of any kind issued to the user by the user's bank.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Unused Bids are eligible for a full refund only if the Bids have been purchased at their full price of 60c per\n        Bid.<\/p>\n    <p>Example (normal priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $60 and Bids 10 times. All the remaining 90 Bids are\n        eligible for a total refund of $54 ( 90 * $0.60 ).<\/p>\n\n    <p>If the Bids have been purchased at a promotional rate of less than 60c per Bid, only the portion of the purchased\n        Bids that the customer would have received at 60c each is eligible for a refund. The refundable portion of the Bids\n        is always used first.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Example (discount priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $30 and Bids 10 times. Only the first 50 Bids of those\n        100 Bids were refundable ( $30 \/ $0.60 = 50 ). John has 40 refundable Bids and 50 free Bids left on his account. He\n        is eligible for a refund of 40 * $0.60 = $24.<\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash reserves the right to sell Bids at any discounted price to specific user groups for promotional purposes.\n        All DealDash users understand that they may from time to time receive unique offers to buy discounted Bids and that\n        other users may do so as well. Similarly, users may see different product pricing, based partly on the activity\n        characteristics of that user. DealDash may issue any number of free bids to users or user groups as part of special\n        promotions or for any other reasons at its discretion.<\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash reserves the right to, at its discretion, remove any sign up or other promotional Bids that have been added\n        to a user's account for free at any given time without further notice.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"15\">\n        <li><strong>No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>Bidders on DealDash are entitled to a No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee on their first Bid Pack purchase.\n        Should a bidder be unsatisfied with the Services for any reason, they are entitled to get their entire first Bid\n        Pack purchase fully refunded in accordance with these Terms. To qualify for a refund, users must email\n        support@dealdash.com within 90 days of purchase and request for the refund. The refund will be credited back to you\n        in 7 business days. The refund will be granted regardless of if you have won or lost auctions, or whether you have\n        Bids left on your account or not. Only 1 refund per person.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"16\">\n        <li><strong>Bidding \/ BidBuddy<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>For online bidding, an individual bid can be submitted by clicking the \"BID NOW\" button, or by using the automated\n        bidding tool called the 'BidBuddy'. After the first Bid Pack purchase used Bids are no longer valid for refunds\n        and it is deducted from the user's Bid balance accordingly.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The BidBuddy can assist bidders in being able to bid in an auction, even if the bidders are not online at that time.\n        Only registered users can submit bids automatically with one or more BidBuddies. The BidBuddy automatically submits\n        bids when there is 1 second left on the auction clock. The user can read about how the BidBuddy operates in the\n        'Help' section.<\/p>\n\n    <p>When you book or add bids to your BidBuddy, if the auction is currently live, the first bid will be placed\n        immediately unless you are currently the highest bidder.<\/p>\n\n    <p>BidBuddy Guarantee: In very popular auctions, BidBuddies booked before the auction starts may not be able to place\n        a bid before the No Jumper limit is reached. In these cases, as long as the BidBuddy was booked before the auction started,\n        and as long as your BidBuddy is not canceled, the spot in the auction is guaranteed.<\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash does not guarantee the precision of the BidBuddy feature and DealDash may not be held responsible for any\n        BidBuddy software errors of commission or omission. The user is prohibited from using any bidding software not\n        authorized by DealDash; if the user does, in fact, use unauthorized software, it may result in immediate\n        disqualification from DealDash's systems and Service. DealDash will from time to time award all users who start\n        using the Site with free Bids. The number of free Bids awarded or not awarded is determined solely by DealDash on an\n        account by account basis.<\/p>\n\n    <p>A bid is registered and counted only when DealDash's system registers the bid. A bid is not counted and valid when it\n        is sent from the user's Web browser, but when DealDash's servers receive and register the bid request.<\/p>\n\n    <p>It usually takes less than a second for a bid to be registered, however it may take up to several seconds or longer\n        for DealDash to receive the bid if there is a delay in the network or if the system is under high stress. DealDash\n        is not responsible for any delays that occur in bidding or in the auctions. DealDash strives to make the DealDash\n        timer clocks as accurate as possible. While DealDash believes that auction timers are very accurate, DealDash cannot\n        and does not guarantee that the system, including the bidding clock, will always function reliably.<\/p>\n\n    <p>All bids are final. Winning bids and their associated fees are non-refundable.<\/p>\n\n    <p>To comply with fair and honest auction practices, DealDash will reschedule auctions that end prematurely due to\n        severe third party or technical problems to a later time. In such events, where all bidders aren't able to\n        participate normally in the auctions, DealDash will return all used Bids from such rescheduled auctions to all\n        involved bidders.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"17\">\n        <li><strong>Winning Limits<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>As described in the House Rules, which are incorporated by reference, each user may win the same item, in the same\n        auction type, only once in a limited time period, as specified in the details for each auction. The winning limit resets\n        automatically once the period has passed from the end onf the auction. The system will prevent users from placing\n        bids on an auction if they have already won the same product during the period. All the booked BidBuddies\n        will automatically be canceled for the other auctions of the same product, when the user wins an auction.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Furthermore, each user may win up to 50 auctions per week. Once a user has reached the 50 wins limit, the system will\n        prevent them from placing bids on any auctions, and all booked BidBuddies will automatically be canceled. The weekly\n        winning limit resets at 00:00 PST on the day of the week you created your account.\n    <\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash reserves the right to, from time to time review the guidelines for any winning limits and may at any time\n        under its sole discretion limit accounts from winning an excessive amount of auctions. DealDash attempts to limit\n        some auctions to users of comparable skill, as determined by DealDash, to enhance user experience and equal chances\n        of winning auctions. In so doing, DealDash may limit which auctions are available to particular users based on any\n        factors deemed appropriate by DealDash in its sole discretion, including experience of the user, historical success\n        of the user, demographic factors, prior bidding and spending activity, and other factors. In particular, DealDash\n        may limit certain auctions to less experienced or successful users in any manner DealDash deems appropriate to\n        optimize the overall user experience of all DealDash users. You acknowledge that You may be, and you consent to\n        being, excluded from auctions at DealDash's discretion.<\/p>\n\n    <p>This limit is put in place to ensure that all users have a high quality of user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"18\">\n        <li><strong>Bid Expiration<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>Bids held in user accounts must be used within 365 days from the day that the Bids have entered the account through\n        purchase, item exchange or auction win. If the Bids have not been used within that time, they will expire and be\n        permanently removed from the account.<\/p>\n\n\n    <ol start=\"19\">\n        <li><strong>How the Auctions Work<\/strong><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\n    <p>With each bid submitted, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by $0.01. A bid submitted by\n        the user constitutes an offer from that user to DealDash to conclude a contract to purchase the item. A contract to\n        purchase the item does not materialize until the auction is finished and the last bidder has followed all the steps\n        provided for in this Section. The purchase contract will exist between DealDash and the user who has submitted the\n        highest bid up until the point when the last bidder has submitted the last qualifying bid of the respective\n        auction.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Each new bid resets the 'countdown time' for the auction. The countdown time for each of the auctions is shown on the\n        auction details. The auction ends when no more bids are submitted within the remaining time stated. However, an\n        auction may not end if anyone else except the highest bidder still has Bids booked on their BidBuddy. In the event\n        of heavy network lag, the BidBuddy may place the bid with a slight delay with the system registering the bid 1+\n        seconds after the auction's countdown time. Such bid will be completely valid, provided that the bidder had booked\n        his BidBuddy within the auction's countdown time.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The user who submits the highest bid and is the last to bid wins the auction. All other Bids on the item expire and\n        will not be refunded. The last bidder is determined based on the records in DealDash's database and DealDash's\n        decision regarding the identity of the last bidder shall be final. If a bid is placed too late, does not reset the\n        timer of an auction or is not correctly registered by the system, it is then invalid. Even though this bid may be\n        the last bid on an auction, it is the last and highest valid bid on an auction that wins the auction.<\/p>\n\n    <p>An invalid bid is one where the auction timer is not reset after the bid has been placed. DealDash recommends its\n        users to always bid at least 5 seconds prior to the auction timer reaches zero, as otherwise the bid might be\n        reflected as accepted by the system, but in reality be received too late.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Auctions may offer the 'Buy It Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' option (\"Buy it Now\"). 'Buy It Now' will\n        allow you to receive your spent Bids back, if you purchase the same model of an identical item at its 'Buy it\n        Now' price. The option to 'Buy It Now' will be offered for a limited period of time (usually 7 days after the\n        auction ends) after which the option to 'Buy It Now' is permanently revoked.<\/p>\n\n    <p>The 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' option is offered at the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' price listed\n        for each auction. The price may vary between auctions for the same product, but will not change not after the first\n        bid has been placed in an auction. The price is provided solely for the purpose of exercising the 'Buy it Now &amp;\n        Get your Bids Back' option. For the avoidance of doubt, DealDash can not guarantee that the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get\n        your Bids Back' prices are comparable to prices for which the item is sold through retailers or other merchants\n        elsewhere, and thus the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' pricing should not be seen as a reflection of product\n        value, or used for price comparisons or other similar purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n    <p>DealDash is not responsible for third party abuse and manipulation of the DealDash service, for example, if other\n        users create chaos on the Site that then results in lost bids. In that case, and other cases of third party abuse,\n        DealDash is not responsible.<\/p>\n\n\n    <p>DealDash is constantly attempting to maintain fairness and balance in its auctions therefore some new users or users\n        who have lost auctions may receive special promotions, access to special auctions, and\/or free Bids through site\n        features.

As\n        soon as the winner has paid the total amount reflected on the 'payment page', the win is accepted.

After this deadline has passed, DealDash can declare a rescission of the purchase contract to\n        the user, which results in revocation of the user's right to delivery of the item. There is likewise no entitlement\n        to replacement of any of the Bids used in the auction. If a user chooses to \"Buy it Now\", the item price including\n        applicable tax fees must be paid within 7 days of the auction ending in order to be eligible. Users are responsible\n        for all applicable tax charges associated with purchases.<\/p>\n\n    <p>Orders may be subject to sales tax (when applicable and required by law). Buy it Now orders the tax is based on the\n        Buy it Now price and for auction wins the tax is based on the final auction price. <\/p>\n\n    <p>The user may obtain and be legally entitled to the product only after the user fully pays for the product and all of\n        the applicable Bids used to obtain the product. Should the user not pay for Bids that have already been purchased,\n        payments received shall be viewed as payment toward the Bids not yet paid for, and a right of retention shall be\n        exercised with regard to the item purchased at auction until all Bids and the total price have been paid in full. If\n        the user chooses to pay for the item by credit card and the sales price is lower than $1, then the price may be\n        rounded up to $1.<\/p>\n\n    <p>DealDash may offer the option to exchange the auction win to bids. If available, the offer is presented before making a\n        payment for the auction win. If the user accepts the exchange to bids offer the bids are added to the user's account,\n        and the user loses the option to pay the auction price (plus applicable taxes) to obtain the item.

In the event that a user wishes to\n        return a Buy it Now order the user also forfeits all the Free Bids given to them alongside the purchase. If the user\n        has used the Free Bids given to them, the user will need to purchase the equivalent number of Bids in order for\n        DealDash to process the refund. Once both the item has been returned and the Free Bids removed from the user's\n        account, a refund will be given. Only Bids that have been acquired by purchasing Bid Packs for the then-current full\n        price shall have a right for refund within 30 calendar days of purchase (90 calendar days for first Bid pack\n        purchase). Such paid Bids are always used first, before promotional Bids, free Bids, Bids obtained through the Buy\n        it Now or other bids that have been obtained in any other way than paying full price for each Bid. Bids obtained\n        during the Buy it Now process do not have any rights to refund. DealDash also grants to the user ordering products\n        for personal purposes the right to cancel in accordance with statutory provisions on mail order sales and\n        e-commerce.

Items that can be shipped\n        in packages are to be returned. In these cases, return is free of charge for the user. Items that cannot be shipped\n        in packages will be picked up upon coordination with the user. A user must satisfy obligations to refund payments\n        within 30 days after sending the user's notice of cancellation.<\/p>\n\n    <p>When a user cancels by the deadline, the user is not obligated to accept delivery.

    </ol>

    <p>The target market for the Services is the United States of America and Canada. Only residents of the aforementioned
        countries are allowed to use the Service. DealDash reserves the right to restrict availability of auctions and delivery
        of items based on the country of the user. The country of the user can be identified based on their IP address, billing
        address or mailing address. The user is responsible for notifying DealDash at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="44373134342b363004202125282025372c6a272b29">[email&#160;protected]</a> in case of their

    <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>General Policies</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The DealDash policies accessible throughout the Site are expressly incorporated by reference into these terms, and
        you should review each carefully. The procedures and guidelines contained below explain the auction process. The <a
                href="https://www.dealdash.com/privacy-policy">DealDash Privacy Policy</a> governs the collection and
        use of user information on the Site. The FAQ provides additional detail on how the Services work, and the House
        Rules set out important details governing every user's rights and obligations. </p>


    <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Contractual Obligations</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The auction process is a method in which the Site solicits offers from buyers for the sale of lots. By submitting
        bids, you are making a legal offer to buy the lot. Once a bid is accepted, a contract is created between the buyer
        and the Site for the sale and purchase of the lot in accordance with the terms disclosed at the time of the auction.
        By using the Services and bidding on a lot, or by using the 'Buy It Now' function, you agree to complete the
        transaction as described and fulfill any and all contractual obligations.</p>


    <ol start="5">
        <li><strong>Access to Systems</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Services, including, without
        limitation: (i) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which the user is
        not authorized to access; (ii) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to
        breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; or (iii) accessing or using the Services or
        any portion thereof without authorization, in violation of these Terms or in violation of applicable law. </p>

    <p>You may not use any scraper, crawler, spider, robot, or other automated means of any kind to access or copy data on
        the Site, deep-link to any feature or content on the Site, bypass our robot exclusion headers, or other measures we
        may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site.</p>

    <p>You agree not to interfere with the Site, Services, or any transaction and agree not to use any device, software, or
        routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activity being conducted
        on or through the Services. You agree not to impose any unreasonably or disproportionately large load on DealDash's
        systems or facilities. You agree not to put any material on the Site that contains any viruses, Trojan horses,
        worms, time bombs, cancelbots or any other computer programming routines that may damage, interfere with,
        surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. Violations of system or network
        security may result in civil or criminal liability. DealDash will investigate occurrences that may involve such
        violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in
        such violations. </p>


    <ol start="6">
        <li><strong>Bidding</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each DealDash bid (a "Bid") is a limited, non-transferable, one-year license to place one bid on a
        DealDash auction. Bids have no monetary value; are not credited against the purchase price of products purchased on
        the Site; and may not be exchanged for money or any items of monetary value.</p>

    <p>Due to the billing of charges, DealDash would like to advise all users to monitor their bidding practices. Repeated
        online bidding can incur high costs. Users should therefore pay attention to their bidding practices.</p>


    <ol start="7">
        <li><strong>Fraud and Other Restricted Behavior</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You acknowledge that in order to maintain fair and honest auctions, DealDash retains the right to monitor and enforce
        any fraudulent or malicious activity on the Site. You acknowledge that you have read what these activities include,
        but are not limited to, in these Terms, the "House Rules" policy, and you agree not to engage in any of these,
        or any other fraudulent or malicious activities. As stated herein, DealDash reserves the right to temporarily or
        permanently suspend any user account engaged or suspected to engage in any such activities.</p>

    <p>You may not register and make bids under a false name or with an invalid credit card. Such fraudulent conduct is a
        violation of federal and state laws. Fraudulent bidders may be reported to relevant state and federal law
        enforcement agencies and DealDash will cooperate to ensure that violators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of
        the law.</p>

    <p>A bidder may not resell any product or service obtained through the Site and Services without prior written consent
        from DealDash, unless it is explicitly allowed in the product description of an auction. Moreover, a user may not 
        use the products to create any investment scheme, commodities contract or pool or otherwise to use DealDash as a 
        product delivery mechanism for a brokered or 'middleman' agreement or obligation. If it is discovered that a user is, 
        in fact, reselling products obtained from DealDash, we reserve the right to suspend the account without further 
        notice, voiding all auctions in which the user has participated. Additionally, the user may be required to compensate 
        DealDash for any damages.</p>

    <p>DealDash reserves the right to refuse any order you place with us. DealDash may, in its sole discretion, limit or
        cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by
        or under the same customer account, the same credit card, geographic region, and/or orders that use the same phone
        number, billing and/or shipping address. In the event DealDash changes or cancels an order, DealDash will attempt to
        notify you by contacting the e-mail, billing address and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made.
        DealDash reserves the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in its sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers,
        resellers, distributors and others who violate these Terms.</p>

    <p>No user may permit or assist others to use the Services for any purpose other than that for which they are intended.
        A user shall not permit or assist others to abuse or fraudulently use the Services, including but not limited to the
        following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Obtaining or attempting to obtain service by any fraudulent means or device with intent to avoid payment;</li>
        <li>Accessing, altering, or destroying any information of another DealDash user by any fraudulent means or device,
            or attempting to do so; or
        </li>
        <li>Using Services so as to interfere with the use of DealDash network by other users or authorized users,
            intentionally or not; or in violation of the law or in aid of any unlawful act.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each user acknowledges that DealDash's network may only be used for lawful purposes. DealDash reserves the right to
        monitor all network activity. While using DealDash, each user agrees to refrain from the following prohibited
        acts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining more than one account or maintaining control or influence over more than one account;</li>
        <li>Infringing upon the intellectual property of DealDash, establishing a competing site, or otherwise copying or
            using the data on the Site for any reason other than bidding on products for the bidder's own use;
        </li>
        <li>Manipulate the bidding process by placing fictitious bids, colluding with other parties to create the illusion
            of volume ('marking the close' or 'painting the tape'), or engaging in any other disingenuous or fraudulent
            activity that undermines the integrity of the online market;
        </li>
        <li>Breaching DealDash's policies;</li>
        <li>Attempting to harvest or otherwise collect information about users, including email addresses;</li>
        <li>Attempting to upload or download any computer virus;</li>
        <li>Attempting to transmit via email any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail", "spam", "chain
            letters", "pyramid schemes", or any other form of email solicitation to other users;
        </li>
        <li>Attempting to communicate with other users to promote or provide instructional information about illegal
            activities, promote physical harm, or injury against any users.
        </li>
        <li>Viewing and/or downloading or uploading pornographic pictures or stories.</li>
        <li>Attempting to attack other people's internet connections, Web Sites or computers, or damage or deface anyone
            else's Web Site.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <ol start="8">
        <li><strong>Collusion/Team Play</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Any kind of collusion or team play is strictly forbidden on DealDash. By definition, this includes, but is not
        limited to, two or more members working together as a team, or creating the impression that there are more people
        involved and competing to win an auction than there actually are, or placing bids until Buy it Now offers are earned
        and then switching over to another account to continue to earn further Buy it Now offers on the same deal.</p>

    <p>DealDash does not allow two members that know, or are associated with, each other to participate in the same auction.
        Two members participating in the auction are by definition engaging in team play, and automatically lose their right
        to purchase the Deal or receive any of their spent bids back. DealDash reserves the right to implement measures,
        determined by the sole discretion of DealDash, that automatically restrict associated accounts from participating in
        the same auctions.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to disqualify, in our absolute discretion, any users we suspect to be working in a team by
        voiding all their wins and freezing their accounts. No funds or Bids will be returned or transferred into other
        accounts. If a user is found to have violated these Terms, any free Bids provided to them and used, including those
        provided in the past, must immediately be paid for by the user at their current selling price.</p>


    <ol start="9">
        <li><strong>Passwords/Equipment</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may not disclose your username and password to any third party and you agree that you are solely responsible for
        any use of or action taken under your account. Your password may be used only to access and use the Services. If
        your user credentials or password is compromised or otherwise disclosed, you must notify DealDash and change your
        password immediately in order to minimize your risk of loss. You are responsible for providing and maintaining all
        equipment necessary to use the Services, including, without limitation, computer hardware and software, modems,
        network or Wi-Fi connections and telephone service. Further, you are solely responsible for (a) maintaining the
        security of your personal information, including, without limitation, account and login information, passwords, and
        financial information; (b) all telephone and toll charges which may apply to your account depending on your
        location; and (c) any other charges resulting from the use of your account.</p>


    <ol start="10">
        <li><strong>Investigation of Violations</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>We may investigate any violation of these Terms, our policies or guidelines, or any other complaints and take any
        action that we deem appropriate and reasonable under the circumstance to protect our systems, facilities, users
        and/or third parties. Our actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing warnings, suspension or termination
        of the Services or any user accounts, and/or removal of or disabling access to content hosted on DealDash's systems.
        We reserve the right and have absolute discretion to remove or disable access, screen, or edit any content that
        violates these provisions or is otherwise objectionable. DealDash also reserves the right to report any activity
        that it suspects violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials.</p>

    <p>DealDash has the right to remove or refuse to post on the Service any Licensed Materials for any or no reason in its
        sole discretion. However, DealDash cannot review all Licensed Materials before it is posted on its Services, and
        cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, DealDash assumes no
        liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or
        third party. DealDash has no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the
        activities described in this Section.</p>


    <ol start="13">
        <li><strong>Registration with DealDash for Use</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>To use the Services, you must first register for an online user account, consisting of a username, password, credit
        card information, billing address, and other information as may be required by DealDash. You may register only once
        and may only have one account at DealDash for your personal use. Additionally, each household or "group of users
        associated with each other", determined by the sole discretion of DealDash, may not register or have control over
        more than two DealDash member accounts. If a single person is found to have or maintain control over several
        accounts on DealDash, or if a household or a "group of users associated with each other" is found to have or
        maintain control over more than two accounts on DealDash, all accounts will be immediately suspended, all auctions
        the accounts have participated in will be voided, and any Bids purchased will be removed without prior warning and
        without any form of compensation.</p>

    <p>During the registration process, the user must choose a username. The username may not offend common decency or
        infringe upon the rights of third parties. The username may also not be misleading in any way or, in DealDash's
        judgment, closely resemble the identity of an existing user. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all
        the information you provide through the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree to maintain and
        promptly update your user account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any
        information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or DealDash has reasonable grounds to suspect
        that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, DealDash may suspend or terminate your
        account or access to the Services. If you abuse your user account, whether it harms a third party or DealDash, you
        may be disqualified and, if applicable, DealDash may notify applicable authorities of the possibility of a
        crime.</p>

    <p>ACCOUNTS AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICES CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED OR USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT
        HOLDER. USE OF THIS ACCOUNT BY A PERSON OR PERSONS NOT AUTHORIZED BY DEALDASH IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. NO MORE THAN
        ONE LOG-IN SESSION OR ONE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT USER CAN BE ACTIVE AT A TIME FOR ANY ACCOUNT. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
        PERMITTED BY THE BIDBUDDY SYSTEM, ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED IN WHOLE, PART, OR PROXY BIDDING TO OTHER
        PARTIES, OR SHOW OTHER ACTIVITY IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, ARE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. DEALDASH RESERVES
        THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN LOGS OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY AND TO USE SAID LOGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTING USAGE IN VIOLATION
        OF THESE TERMS.</p>

    <p>DealDash reserves the right to at any time temporarily or permanently disqualify a user for violating these Terms.
        Users will be disqualified when, in DealDash's reasonable opinion, a user has violated any law, regulation or
        equitable interest in favor of a third party, such as protecting users and the Service from manipulation. Examples
        of the foregoing include, but are not limited to, (i) honoring bids of users who have not paid for the Bids, (ii)
        the use of unauthorized bidding software, or (iii) establishing several user accounts for the same person. Moreover,
        DealDash reserves the right to cancel unauthorized DealDash accounts or accounts that have been inactive. Each user
        agrees not to hold DealDash responsible for any loss incurred as a result of such action.</p>


    <ol start="14">
        <li><strong>Bid Purchasing for Online Bidding / Payment</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        All prices are quoted and payments processed in United States dollars. The user is responsible for conversion rates
        and fees which may occur in case of a currency conversion done by their bank or payment processor.
    </p>

    <p>DealDash Bids must be purchased by users prior to online bidding. Only registered users can submit the online bids,
        which can be purchased in packages (so-called 'Bid Packs') at the currently applicable prices, which can be viewed
        in 'My Dashboard' under 'Buy bids'. The Bids must be paid for in advance. When the Bids are purchased and deposited
        into the user's DealDash account, a contract for the purchase of the Bids materializes. The associated invoice is
        due immediately. If a user is suspended for whatever reason, all of their Bids will be forfeited and will not be
        refunded.</p>

    <p>Users who have won an auction and paid for a product are not eligible for a refund on either Bid purchases, account
        activation fees, or product fees if their product has been shipped by the time of request.</p>

    <p>Should a payment not be honored for a user, a returned payment fee will be charged. The user shall be solely
        responsible for these fees. DealDash reserves the right to block access to the user account until full payment is
        received by DealDash for the outstanding amount, including any fees due to returned payment, etc. DealDash may
        withhold any outstanding deliveries until it receives full payment. The user's bank may or may not charge the user
        an international payment fee in connection with a credit card payment on the DealDash site. It is the sole
        responsibility of the user to be familiar with the policies and practices of his or her bank for such fees. DealDash
        holds no responsibility for additional payment fees of any kind issued to the user by the user's bank.</p>

    <p>Unused Bids are eligible for a full refund only if the Bids have been purchased at their full price of 60c per
        Bid.</p>
    <p>Example (normal priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $60 and Bids 10 times. All the remaining 90 Bids are
        eligible for a total refund of $54 ( 90 * $0.60 ).</p>

    <p>If the Bids have been purchased at a promotional rate of less than 60c per Bid, only the portion of the purchased
        Bids that the customer would have received at 60c each is eligible for a refund. The refundable portion of the Bids
        is always used first.</p>

    <p>Example (discount priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $30 and Bids 10 times. Only the first 50 Bids of those
        100 Bids were refundable ( $30 / $0.60 = 50 ). John has 40 refundable Bids and 50 free Bids left on his account. He
        is eligible for a refund of 40 * $0.60 = $24.</p>

    <p>DealDash reserves the right to sell Bids at any discounted price to specific user groups for promotional purposes.
        All DealDash users understand that they may from time to time receive unique offers to buy discounted Bids and that
        other users may do so as well. Similarly, users may see different product pricing, based partly on the activity
        characteristics of that user. DealDash may issue any number of free bids to users or user groups as part of special
        promotions or for any other reasons at its discretion.</p>

    <p>DealDash reserves the right to, at its discretion, remove any sign up or other promotional Bids that have been added
        to a user's account for free at any given time without further notice.</p>


    <ol start="15">
        <li><strong>No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Bidders on DealDash are entitled to a No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee on their first Bid Pack purchase.
        Should a bidder be unsatisfied with the Services for any reason, they are entitled to get their entire first Bid
        Pack purchase fully refunded in accordance with these Terms. To qualify for a refund, users must email
        <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="60131510100f1214200405010c040113084e030f0d">[email&#160;protected]</a> within 90 days of purchase and request for the refund. The refund will be credited back to you
        in 7 business days. The refund will be granted regardless of if you have won or lost auctions, or whether you have
        Bids left on your account or not. Only 1 refund per person.</p>


    <ol start="16">
        <li><strong>Bidding / BidBuddy</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For online bidding, an individual bid can be submitted by clicking the "BID NOW" button, or by using the automated
        bidding tool called the 'BidBuddy'. After the first Bid Pack purchase used Bids are no longer valid for refunds
        and it is deducted from the user's Bid balance accordingly.</p>

    <p>The BidBuddy can assist bidders in being able to bid in an auction, even if the bidders are not online at that time.
        Only registered users can submit bids automatically with one or more BidBuddies. The BidBuddy automatically submits
        bids when there is 1 second left on the auction clock. The user can read about how the BidBuddy operates in the
        'Help' section.</p>

    <p>When you book or add bids to your BidBuddy, if the auction is currently live, the first bid will be placed
        immediately unless you are currently the highest bidder.</p>

    <p>BidBuddy Guarantee: In very popular auctions, BidBuddies booked before the auction starts may not be able to place
        a bid before the No Jumper limit is reached. In these cases, as long as the BidBuddy was booked before the auction started,
        and as long as your BidBuddy is not canceled, the spot in the auction is guaranteed.</p>

    <p>DealDash does not guarantee the precision of the BidBuddy feature and DealDash may not be held responsible for any
        BidBuddy software errors of commission or omission. The user is prohibited from using any bidding software not
        authorized by DealDash; if the user does, in fact, use unauthorized software, it may result in immediate
        disqualification from DealDash's systems and Service. DealDash will from time to time award all users who start
        using the Site with free Bids. The number of free Bids awarded or not awarded is determined solely by DealDash on an
        account by account basis.</p>

    <p>A bid is registered and counted only when DealDash's system registers the bid. A bid is not counted and valid when it
        is sent from the user's Web browser, but when DealDash's servers receive and register the bid request.</p>

    <p>It usually takes less than a second for a bid to be registered, however it may take up to several seconds or longer
        for DealDash to receive the bid if there is a delay in the network or if the system is under high stress. DealDash
        is not responsible for any delays that occur in bidding or in the auctions. DealDash strives to make the DealDash
        timer clocks as accurate as possible. While DealDash believes that auction timers are very accurate, DealDash cannot
        and does not guarantee that the system, including the bidding clock, will always function reliably.</p>

    <p>All bids are final. Winning bids and their associated fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <p>To comply with fair and honest auction practices, DealDash will reschedule auctions that end prematurely due to
        severe third party or technical problems to a later time. In such events, where all bidders aren't able to
        participate normally in the auctions, DealDash will return all used Bids from such rescheduled auctions to all
        involved bidders.</p>


    <ol start="17">
        <li><strong>Winning Limits</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>As described in the House Rules, which are incorporated by reference, each user may win the same item, in the same
        auction type, only once in a limited time period, as specified in the details for each auction. The winning limit resets
        automatically once the period has passed from the end onf the auction. The system will prevent users from placing
        bids on an auction if they have already won the same product during the period. All the booked BidBuddies
        will automatically be canceled for the other auctions of the same product, when the user wins an auction.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, each user may win up to 50 auctions per week. Once a user has reached the 50 wins limit, the system will
        prevent them from placing bids on any auctions, and all booked BidBuddies will automatically be canceled. The weekly
        winning limit resets at 00:00 PST on the day of the week you created your account.
    </p>

    <p>DealDash reserves the right to, from time to time review the guidelines for any winning limits and may at any time
        under its sole discretion limit accounts from winning an excessive amount of auctions. DealDash attempts to limit
        some auctions to users of comparable skill, as determined by DealDash, to enhance user experience and equal chances
        of winning auctions. In so doing, DealDash may limit which auctions are available to particular users based on any
        factors deemed appropriate by DealDash in its sole discretion, including experience of the user, historical success
        of the user, demographic factors, prior bidding and spending activity, and other factors. In particular, DealDash
        may limit certain auctions to less experienced or successful users in any manner DealDash deems appropriate to
        optimize the overall user experience of all DealDash users. You acknowledge that You may be, and you consent to
        being, excluded from auctions at DealDash's discretion.</p>

    <p>This limit is put in place to ensure that all users have a high quality of user experience.</p>


    <ol start="18">
        <li><strong>Bid Expiration</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Bids held in user accounts must be used within 365 days from the day that the Bids have entered the account through
        purchase, item exchange or auction win. If the Bids have not been used within that time, they will expire and be
        permanently removed from the account.</p>


    <ol start="19">
        <li><strong>How the Auctions Work</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>With each bid submitted, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by $0.01. A bid submitted by
        the user constitutes an offer from that user to DealDash to conclude a contract to purchase the item. A contract to
        purchase the item does not materialize until the auction is finished and the last bidder has followed all the steps
        provided for in this Section. The purchase contract will exist between DealDash and the user who has submitted the
        highest bid up until the point when the last bidder has submitted the last qualifying bid of the respective
        auction.</p>

    <p>Each new bid resets the 'countdown time' for the auction. The countdown time for each of the auctions is shown on the
        auction details. The auction ends when no more bids are submitted within the remaining time stated. However, an
        auction may not end if anyone else except the highest bidder still has Bids booked on their BidBuddy. In the event
        of heavy network lag, the BidBuddy may place the bid with a slight delay with the system registering the bid 1+
        seconds after the auction's countdown time. Such bid will be completely valid, provided that the bidder had booked
        his BidBuddy within the auction's countdown time.</p>

    <p>The user who submits the highest bid and is the last to bid wins the auction. All other Bids on the item expire and
        will not be refunded. The last bidder is determined based on the records in DealDash's database and DealDash's
        decision regarding the identity of the last bidder shall be final. If a bid is placed too late, does not reset the
        timer of an auction or is not correctly registered by the system, it is then invalid. Even though this bid may be
        the last bid on an auction, it is the last and highest valid bid on an auction that wins the auction.</p>

    <p>An invalid bid is one where the auction timer is not reset after the bid has been placed. DealDash recommends its
        users to always bid at least 5 seconds prior to the auction timer reaches zero, as otherwise the bid might be
        reflected as accepted by the system, but in reality be received too late.</p>

    <p>Auctions may offer the 'Buy It Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' option ("Buy it Now"). 'Buy It Now' will
        allow you to receive your spent Bids back, if you purchase the same model of an identical item at its 'Buy it
        Now' price. The option to 'Buy It Now' will be offered for a limited period of time (usually 7 days after the
        auction ends) after which the option to 'Buy It Now' is permanently revoked.</p>

    <p>The 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' option is offered at the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' price listed
        for each auction. The price may vary between auctions for the same product, but will not change not after the first
        bid has been placed in an auction. The price is provided solely for the purpose of exercising the 'Buy it Now &amp;
        Get your Bids Back' option. For the avoidance of doubt, DealDash can not guarantee that the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get
        your Bids Back' prices are comparable to prices for which the item is sold through retailers or other merchants
        elsewhere, and thus the 'Buy it Now &amp; Get your Bids Back' pricing should not be seen as a reflection of product
        value, or used for price comparisons or other similar purposes.</p>


    <p>DealDash is not responsible for third party abuse and manipulation of the DealDash service, for example, if other
        users create chaos on the Site that then results in lost bids. In that case, and other cases of third party abuse,
        DealDash is not responsible.</p>


    <p>DealDash is constantly attempting to maintain fairness and balance in its auctions therefore some new users or users
        who have lost auctions may receive special promotions, access to special auctions, and/or free Bids through site
        features. This is designed to maintain fair practice and helps balance and create a great auction experience for all
        users.</p>


    <ol start="20">
        <li><strong>Notification of the Win / Acceptance of the Win / Payment</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>After the auction has ended, the highest bidder ('winner') who is logged on with DealDash will see a 'congratulation
        page' displayed, along with all of the important information such as the total price, the payment details, etc. The
        user must actively confirm the win by following the steps indicated on that page or elsewhere on the Services. As
        soon as the winner has paid the total amount reflected on the 'payment page', the win is accepted. The winner will
        also receive a notification of the win by e-mail with a request for payment.</p>

    <p>The user must pay the total price (auction price and applicable taxes) no later than 14 days after the notification
        of the win is sent. After this deadline has passed, DealDash can declare a rescission of the purchase contract to
        the user, which results in revocation of the user's right to delivery of the item. There is likewise no entitlement
        to replacement of any of the Bids used in the auction. If a user chooses to "Buy it Now", the item price including
        applicable tax fees must be paid within 7 days of the auction ending in order to be eligible. Users are responsible
        for all applicable tax charges associated with purchases.</p>

    <p>Orders may be subject to sales tax (when applicable and required by law). Buy it Now orders the tax is based on the
        Buy it Now price and for auction wins the tax is based on the final auction price. </p>

    <p>The user may obtain and be legally entitled to the product only after the user fully pays for the product and all of
        the applicable Bids used to obtain the product. Should the user not pay for Bids that have already been purchased,
        payments received shall be viewed as payment toward the Bids not yet paid for, and a right of retention shall be
        exercised with regard to the item purchased at auction until all Bids and the total price have been paid in full. If
        the user chooses to pay for the item by credit card and the sales price is lower than $1, then the price may be
        rounded up to $1.</p>

    <p>DealDash may offer the option to exchange the auction win to bids. If available, the offer is presented before making a
        payment for the auction win. If the user accepts the exchange to bids offer the bids are added to the user's account,
        and the user loses the option to pay the auction price (plus applicable taxes) to obtain the item. The offer may change
        over time and vary between users and auctions.</p>

    <p>If the user does not receive the won product or product obtained through "Buy it Now", the user must file in a claim
        of non-receipt via e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1e6d6b6e6e716c6a5e7a7b7f727a7f6d76307d7173">[email&#160;protected]</a> within sixty (60) calendar days of the purchase, or
        DealDash's obligation to deliver the product will end. No refunds of the purchase amount or cost of spent Bids to
        win the item will be returned to the user.</p>

    <p>DealDash is not responsible for stolen or lost items. In the event that a product is stolen or lost, DealDash will do
        its best to help customers upon request, by providing tracking information received from the supplier, as well as
        screenshots or copies of the sales receipt and possible shipping confirmation, if available.</p>


    <ol start="21">
        <li><strong>Cancellation / Rescission</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The user may return the item in an un-depreciated condition within 30 days of receipt if not satisfied for any
        reason. Upon verification of the product's condition, DealDash will refund the purchase price of the product.
        DealDash will not refund the value of the Bids spent to obtain the product. In the event that a user wishes to
        return a Buy it Now order the user also forfeits all the Free Bids given to them alongside the purchase. If the user
        has used the Free Bids given to them, the user will need to purchase the equivalent number of Bids in order for
        DealDash to process the refund. Once both the item has been returned and the Free Bids removed from the user's
        account, a refund will be given. Only Bids that have been acquired by purchasing Bid Packs for the then-current full
        price shall have a right for refund within 30 calendar days of purchase (90 calendar days for first Bid pack
        purchase). Such paid Bids are always used first, before promotional Bids, free Bids, Bids obtained through the Buy
        it Now or other bids that have been obtained in any other way than paying full price for each Bid. Bids obtained
        during the Buy it Now process do not have any rights to refund. DealDash also grants to the user ordering products
        for personal purposes the right to cancel in accordance with statutory provisions on mail order sales and
        e-commerce. The right to cancel does not exist in the case of mail order sales and e-commerce contracts for the
        delivery of audio and video recordings or of software, if and to the extent that the seal on the delivered media has
        been broken by the user.</p>


    <ol start="22">
        <li><strong>Right to cancel</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may cancel your contract within 30 days in written notice (e.g. letter, e-mail) to DealDash or by returning the
        items, without stating your reasons.</p>

    <p>The 30 day period begins when the item is received. Receipt can be e-mail receipt to the e-mail address provided to
        DealDash below. Cancellation is to be sent to the following address:</p>

    <p>DealDash Inc<br/>

    <ol start="23">
        <li><strong>Consequences of Cancellation</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the case of a valid cancellation, both parties must return what has been received in performance of the contract
        and the benefits derived therefrom (e.g. interest) as applicable. If user is unable to return to DealDash the
        service or product that the user received or is only able to return it in part or only in a depreciated condition,
        the user must compensate DealDash for the difference in value, unless the deterioration resulted from proper use. In
        the case of use of items, the foregoing compensation provision will not apply if the deterioration of the item is
        attributable solely to it being tested comparable to those tests that may reasonably be performed in a retail store.
        In other respects, the user may avoid this duty to pay compensation by not using the item(s) as the user would use
        his/her own property, and by refraining from any action that would detract from its value. Items that can be shipped
        in packages are to be returned. In these cases, return is free of charge for the user. Items that cannot be shipped
        in packages will be picked up upon coordination with the user. A user must satisfy obligations to refund payments
        within 30 days after sending the user's notice of cancellation.</p>

    <p>When a user cancels by the deadline, the user is not obligated to accept delivery. Under those circumstances where
        DealDash cancels by the deadline, DealDash will refund any purchase price already paid. The foregoing
        notwithstanding, the service charge (e.g. money spent on purchase of Bids) will not be refunded.</p>

    <p>Users may return items received from DealDash within 30 days of receipt for any reason however are subject to
        applicable return shipping or pick up fees.</p>

    <p>Should DealDash incur additional costs for insufficient postage on the return, for a COD shipment, or for courier
        shipments and other irregular shipping methods that are over and above postal shipping costs, these costs will be
        deducted from any payment remitted by the user. Items in sets and boxes can only be returned in their entirety.</p>


    <ol start="24">
        <li><strong>Delivery</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, delivery will be made from DealDash's supplier's warehouse or from DealDash's warehouse to
        the address provided by the user. Deliveries are made solely within the continental US.
        DealDash may engage third parties to satisfy its contractual obligations without being
        required to notify the buyer. Obvious damage to the item from transport or packaging damaged during transport is to
        be reported to the supplier upon taking delivery.</p>

    <p>Should DealDash not be able to deliver the item ordered for whichever reason, DealDash is entitled to declare
        rescission to the user or to substitute the item with a comparable replacement product with similar features.
        DealDash may also choose to replace the item ordered with a gift card of the value of the item that the user may
        choose to use to obtain the same product. This also applies for items ordered through Buy it Now from the DealDash
        store.</p>

    <p>If the product delivered is damaged, defective, or otherwise does not match the product description, DealDash will
        replace the product at DealDash's expense. Please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7b080e0b0b14090f3b1f1e1a171f1a081355181416">[email&#160;protected]</a> to arrange return and replacement of
        any such product. Replacement is not covered for any items shipped to a freight forwarding company and shipment to a
        freight forwarding company is not permitted under these Terms.</p>


    <ol start="25">
        <li><strong>Right of Substitution</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Subject to the cancellation policy specified herein, DealDash may substitute another similar item of the same general
        character or function, provided it has the same or higher retail value, for purposes of delivery to the user. DealDash 
        may substitute another similar item of a lesser value if the user requests one. DealDash may also choose to substitute 
        the item ordered with a gift card of the value of the item. A gift card may be the most suitable substitute solution 
        for challenges related to product availability or supplier challenges. Such right of substitution may be necessary from 
        time to time if, for example, unforeseen or undetected challenges arise with the manufacturing or inventory system of 
        the supplier, impacting the ability to deliver the exact item sought by the user.</p>


    <ol start="26">
        <li><strong>Product Correction </strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If DealDash is unable to provide the user with the item auctioned due to unforeseen circumstances, DealDash reserves
        the right to offer the winner in its absolute discretion an alternative item in the same price range or the
        equivalent of the item's Manufacturer's Recommended Retail Price ('MSRP') in Bids so that if a Bid's
        then-current price is $0.60, DealDash issuing one (1) Bid to the user is equal to $0.60.</p>

    <p>Should subsequent correction be undertaken by way of delivery of the item originally auctioned, the user shall be
        obligated to return to DealDash the substituted item delivered within 30 days at DealDash's expense. </p>

    <p>Items delivered shall remain DealDash's property until payment in full of the total price, including for the Bids
        used in the auction. Until such time as full payment has been made, the user undertakes to store the item separately
        from their other possessions and to insure it. DealDash shall have full rights of access to the place where the item
        is located during normal business hours to take possession of it.</p>

    <p>These Terms will continue until either party chooses to terminate them. This may be done by you at any time upon (1)
        receipt by DealDash of written notice of your termination, and (2) your ceasing to use and access the Service

    <p>You understand and agree no waiver by DealDash of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a
        further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure
        of DealDash or any DealDash affiliate to enforce their rights under these Terms or at law will not be considered a
