<p><strong>C. COOKIES </strong><br />
A cookie is a data file that contains an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.<br />
Cookies can be categorized as&#8221;persistent&#8221; cookies or &#8220;session&#8221; cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by the user before the expiration date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user&#8217;s session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies typically do not contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored and obtained from cookies.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to better understand how individuals are using our Sites and Services; cookies will not be used for purposes unrelated to PSafe&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.

<p><em>Third-Party Service Providers</em></p>
<p>We may share users&#8217; Personal Information with service providers or &#8220;third-party&#8221; companies that enhance or facilitate PSafe&#8217;s operations or provide services on our behalf, such as (but not limited to) transportation services, call centers, or loyalty programs, among others. However, the user agrees that PSafe is not responsible for the misuse of the user&#8217;s personal information by these companies or websites.<br />
In some cases, these service providers collect information directly from the user (for example, in the case of purchases through application stores, or requests to conduct surveys or studies). In these cases, the user will receive notification of a service provider&#8217;s involvement in such activities, and the user will have complete freedom over which information to provide.<br />
To facilitate such situations and to handle any additional information provided directly to these service providers, these service providers will use the information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
