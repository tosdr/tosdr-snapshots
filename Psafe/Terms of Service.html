<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SERVICES.</strong></p>

<p><strong>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THESE TERMS OF USE.</strong></p>

<p>1.2.1. PSafe may, at its sole discretion, not accept the registration of any user account and PSafe may suspend or terminate your account and/or refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) at any time for any reason. You agree that PSafe, nor its affiliates, suppliers or licensors, will be liable to you or to any third party for any rejection of registration of your account, suspension or termination of your account or any refusal of any use of the Services (or any portion thereof).</p>
<p>1.2.2. The truth and accuracy of the data provided by users is an essential requirement for maintaining your account.</p>
<p>1.2.3. It is prohibited for one person to have more than one account. If PSafe detects duplicate accounts, through the data verification system, both accounts will be permanently disabled.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Amendments to the Terms of Use</strong></p>
<p>2.1. PLEASE NOTE THAT these Terms of Use are subject to change by PSafe in its sole discretion at any time. When changes are made, PSafe will make a new copy of the Terms of Use available on the Websites. We will also update the “Updated” date at the top of these Terms of Use. If we make any material changes, we may also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you provided to us. Any changes to the Terms of Use will be effective immediately for new users of the Websites and/or Services and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting notice of such changes on the Websites or thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes for existing users (only if such existing users have provided PSafe with a valid e-mail address). PSafe may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms of Use in a specified manner before further use of the Websites and/ or the Services is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the Websites and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the Websites and/or Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITES TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS OF USE.</p>

<p>8.1. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all text, images, photographs, data, information or other materials provided or uploaded by you to the Websites (“User Generated Content”), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, on or through the Websites. You, and not PSafe, are solely responsible for all User Generated Content that is associated with your account.

While PSafe does not review User Generated Content as a matter of course, we may determine, in our sole discretion, that certain User Generated Content violates these Terms of Use, and in such case, we may delete such content. PSafe does not actively monitor or control any User Generated Content on the Websites and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability or quality of such content. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you may consider offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will PSafe be liable for any User Generated Content posted by any other user of the Services, including any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any User Generated Content. You agree that PSafe may, at any time, in its sole discretion, refuse to post, store or transmit any User Generated Content.</p>
<p>8.3. You acknowledge and agree that PSafe may access, preserve and disclose account information and/or User Generated Content that you provide if PSafe is required to do so by applicable law or if we believe in good faith that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce these Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any User Generated Content violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of PSafe, our employees, directors or officers, partners and agents, or members of the public.</p>

<p>PSafe Technology, Inc.<br />
Attn: Copyright Agent<br />

<p>9.3. The above process may be used to inform us of potential or suspected violations of other intellectual property rights, including unauthorized use of trademarked material.</p>
<p>9.4. We may remove User Generated Content and other content on the Services alleged to be infringing, and we reserve the right to terminate the right to use the Services of any user who infringes the intellectual property rights of another person or entity, in each case without prior notice and at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
<p>10.1. The user shall indemnify and hold the PSafe Parties harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of (a) his activities on the Websites or use of the Services, (b) noncompliance with these Terms of Use or (c) his violation of any law, rule, or regulation or rights of third parties. PSafe reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with PSafe in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the PSafe Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such PSafe party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your account, these Terms of Use or your access to or use of the Services.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>11.1. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PSAFE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, OR DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR PERSONAL OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, WHETHER OR NOT PSAFE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE, ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, RESULTING FROM: (1) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED FOR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SERVICES; (3) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (4) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES; OR (5) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATED TO THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, COPYRIGHT, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

<p>11.3. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN PSAFE AND YOU.</p>
<p>12. <strong>Use of Instant Messaging </strong></p>
<p>12.1. PSafe may make available to the users of its Services an electronic tool that allows for the sending and receiving of instant messages between users and PSafe’s agents, which can be accessed by the user via the pages on the Websites in the “Help” section (when available) or through other means as PSafe determines from time to time. Through this tool, users can ask questions, request additional information and make requests and complaints regarding PSafe’s Services.</p>
<p>12.2. PSafe may provide the tool to facilitate contact between the user and PSafe, in order to improve the quality of the Services provided to users of the Services. However, PSafe reserves the right to terminate, at its sole discretion, any instant messaging session established between a user and a PSafe agent if the user acts inappropriately or in a manner not consistent with the purpose of the electronic tool, or shares any inappropriate or improper content with a PSafe agent. The user agrees that when using the instant messaging tool, all messages exchanged between the user and the PSafe agent will be stored on PSafe servers.</p>
<p>13. <strong>Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with PSafe and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong></p>
<p>13.1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with PSafe, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or PSafe may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).</p>
<p>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH PSAFE, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST PSAFE ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST PSAFE IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>13.2. Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: PSafe Tecnologia Ltda., Caixa Postal 10900, Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana 540, Loja A, AC Copacabana, 22020-970, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>13.3. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and PSafe. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>
<p>13.3. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU AND PSAFE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and PSafe are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified herein. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>
<p>13.4. WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER LICENSEE. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court as set forth herein.</p>
<p>13.5. Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with PSafe.</p>
<p>13.6. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if PSafe makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to PSafe.</p>
<p>13.7. Exclusive Venue. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and PSafe agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>14.<strong> Export</strong></p>
<p>14.1. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by applicable laws. You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior government authorization of the applicable government entity, export, re-export, or transfer the Services, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.</p>
<p>15. <strong>Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>15.1. PSafe is located at the address set forth below. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
<p>16. <strong>Electronic Communications</strong></p>
<p>16.1. The communications between you and PSafe use electronic means, whether you use the Websites or Services, use instant messaging functions on the Websites or send us emails, or whether PSafe posts notices on the Websites or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from PSafe in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that PSafe provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</p>
<p>17. <strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>17.1. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of these Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to PSafe is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms of Use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without PSafe’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. PSafe may freely assign these Terms of Use. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon permitted assignees. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms of Use and all related documents have been drawn up in English. Where PSafe requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing PSafe with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to PSafe is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by these Terms of Use, PSafe’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to PSafe at the address set forth below. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by PSafe by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address. If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Services, please contact us at the address below. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your concerns have been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation. All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of the Terms of Use, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p>
<p>18. <strong>Force Majeure</strong></p>
<p>18.1. Neither PSafe nor its affiliates, suppliers or licensors will be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
