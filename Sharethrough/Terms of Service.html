Revenue Sharing Terms. </strong>The Parties will share in the revenue generated by or in connection with the Platform, including any advertising served to Publisher’s customers through the Platform (“Revenue Sharing”). Sharethrough shall pay to Publisher an amount equal to the revenue billed to, and actually collected from, advertisers by Sharethrough in a given calendar month from advertisements displayed on the Publisher Sites via the Platform, less the Sharethrough revenue share, ad-serving fees, and any other applicable fees, costs, and expenses (herein the “Net Earningsʺ).

Net Earnings will be calculated on a monthly basis. Sharethrough shall pay Publisher only for those months in which Net Earnings exceed one hundred ($100) US dollars.

Net Earnings shall be paid to Publisher in accordance with the payment terms, currency, and Revenue Sharing rates agreed to by the Parties in the applicable Order Form. If Sharethrough collects revenue in a currency other than the one agreed to by the Parties in the applicable Order Form, Publisher agrees that Sharethrough will convert such sums using the exchange rates that Sharethrough uses for transactions made for its own account. Publisher must raise any issues regarding the Net Earnings in writing to Sharethrough within ten (10) days of receipt of the relevant Net Earnings. If Publisher fails to provide Sharethrough with such timely notice then Publisher hereby waives its right to dispute any such amounts. Sharethrough reserves the right to withhold payment from the Publisher in the event of any violation by Publisher of this Agreement.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>6.2.

Other Sharethrough Products and Services. </strong>All other Sharethrough products and services requested by Publisher shall be provided upon mutual agreement of the Parties and shall be subject to Publisher’s payment of Sharethrough’s then-current fees and expenses.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>6.4. Fees and Earnings; Google Open Bidding.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contrary in this Agreement, for Publishers utilizing Google Open Bidding, Publisher’s sole remedy for payments is via its relationship with Google. Sharethrough reserves the right to enforce credits and/or deductions directly with Publisher to the extent this Agreement creates such a credit. Sharethrough will pay to Google, Inc. the sum of the cleared price after the auction has been run for a given ad opportunity, which will be calculated using a first-price or second-price auction depending on the type of bid submitted of won and rendered Ad Impressions. Google, Inc. may pay a portion of these funds to Publisher.</p>

              <div class="w-richtext">
                <p><strong>9.1. Confidential Information. </strong>Each Party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose business, technical, or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information” of the Disclosing Party). Confidential Information of Sharethrough includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Platform. The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information, and (ii) not to use (except in performance of Services, provision of the Platform, or as otherwise permitted herein) or divulge to any third person any such Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply to any portion of information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public, (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, (d) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, or (e) is required to be disclosed by law, provided such disclosure is made in accordance with Section 9.6 (Compelled Disclosures).<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.2. Publisher Data.</strong> As between Publisher and Sharethrough, Publisher shall own all right, title, and interest in and to the information and data Publisher loads into the Platform (“Publisher Data”). Publisher grants Sharethrough a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to use Publisher Data to perform this Agreement. Publisher will be responsible for obtaining all rights, permissions, and authorizations to provide the Publisher Data to Sharethrough for use as contemplated under this Agreement. For clarity, Publisher Data does not include Personal Data as described under the DPA, Sharethrough AdTech Data, or third party proprietary data (such as DSP cookies/pixels). Publisher shall: (i) comply with all applicable law related to Publisher Data; (ii) provide the relevant individuals, including, as applicable, End Users, with all information or notices related to the collection, receipt, transmission, access, storage, disposal, use, or disclosure of Publisher Data; and (iii) obtain the necessary consent of or provide choices to such individuals as required by law.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.3. Sharethrough AdTech Data.</strong> As between Publishers and Sharethrough, Sharethrough shall own all right, title, and interest in and to all information and data created, collected, received, transmitted, accessed, stored, disposed of, used, or disclosed through the use of the Sharethrough AdTech. <br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.4. Ownership. </strong>Sharethrough shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to (i) the Platform, all improvements, enhancements, customizations, configurations, or modifications thereto, (ii) any software, applications, inventions, or other technology developed in connection with the Platform or support services, (iii) any and all ideas, processes, techniques, designs, architecture, user interfaces, and “know-how” embodying the Platform, (iv) the Documentation, and (v) all intellectual property rights related to any of the foregoing. Under no circumstances will Publisher be deemed to receive title to any portion of the Platform, title to which at all times will vest exclusively in Sharethrough. Publisher will preserve the Platform from any liens, encumbrances, and claims of any individual or entity. Publisher will not use any Sharethrough Confidential Information to contest the validity of any intellectual property rights of Sharethrough or its licensors. Any such use of Sharethrough’s Confidential Information will constitute a material, non-curable breach of this Agreement.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.5. Usage Data. </strong>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Sharethrough shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use, and performance of various aspects of the Platform and related systems and technologies (including information concerning Publisher Data and data derived therefrom), and Sharethrough will be free (during and after the Term hereof) to (i) use such information and data to improve and enhance the Platform and for other development, diagnostic, and corrective purposes in connection with the Platform and other Sharethrough offerings, and (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregated or other de-identified form in connection with its business. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly set forth herein.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.6. Feedback. </strong>Publisher may provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback (collectively, “Feedback”) to Sharethrough with respect to the Platform and related Services. Feedback is voluntary and Sharethrough is not required to hold it in confidence. Sharethrough may use Feedback for any purpose without obligation or restrictions of any kind. To the extent a license is required under Publisher’s intellectual property rights to make use of the Feedback, Publisher hereby grants Sharethrough an irrevocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Feedback in connection with Sharethrough’s business, including the enhancement of Sharethrough’s products and Services.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.7. Compelled Disclosures. </strong>To the extent required by applicable law or by lawful order or requirement of a court or governmental authority having competent jurisdiction over the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with such law or order or requirement, subject to the following conditions: as soon as possible after becoming aware of such law, order, or requirement and prior to disclosing Confidential Information pursuant thereto, the Receiving Party will so notify the Disclosing Party in writing and, if possible, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party notice not less than five (5) business days prior to the required disclosure. The Receiving Party will use reasonable efforts not to release Confidential Information pending the outcome of any measures taken by the Disclosing Party to contest, otherwise oppose, or seek to limit such disclosure by the Receiving Party and any subsequent disclosure or use of Confidential Information that may result from such disclosure. The Receiving Party will cooperate with and provide assistance to the Disclosing Party regarding such measures. Notwithstanding any such compelled disclosure by the Receiving Party, such compelled disclosure will not otherwise affect the Receiving Party’s obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information so disclosed.<br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.8. Return of Publisher Data. </strong>Within a reasonable time after expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Sharethrough will make all Publisher Data available to Publisher for electronic retrieval for a period of sixty (60) days. <br /></p>
                <p><strong>9.9. Non-Exclusive Equitable Remedy.</strong> Each Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Confidential Information there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach or threatened breach may allow a Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the other Party resulting in irreparable harm to such Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, each Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable remedies, and may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving actual loss, in addition to whatever remedies either of them might have at law or equity. Any breach of this Section 9 (Confidentiality; Proprietary Rights) will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement in the exclusive discretion of the non-breaching Party.</p>
