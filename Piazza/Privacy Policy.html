                  <h3>Our Legal Bases for Use of Your Information</h3>
                  <p>The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, disclosing, or otherwise processing your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>
                  <ul>

                  <h3>PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>
                  <p>The following information applies to California residents regarding âpersonal informationâ (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ)). This information and the rights discussed below do not apply to information collected about employees, former employees, candidates, or independent contractors. In this section, where we use a term in âquotes,â we refer to the meaning of that term in the CCPA.</p>
                  <p><strong class="italic">Categories of personal information we collect, use and disclose.</strong> Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect from you and other users (as described above) and discuss how we use and disclose such information.</p>
                  <p>
                    We may collect the following categories of personal information about you:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Identifiers (such as name, email address);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Device identifiers (such as IP address);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Professional and employment related information;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Education data;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Financial information (such as payment information for enterprise accounts);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      General location data;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      User-generated content;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Audio and visual information (such as when you call for customer support);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Physical characteristics or description (e.g., if you voluntarily submit a photo); and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We also collect âsensitive personal information,â as that term is defined in the CCPA. The categories of âsensitive personal informationâ we collect are account log-in and password or other credentials allowing access to your account. We may also collect sensitive personal information in UGC, such as when you voluntarily post information revealing your race, religion, sexual orientation, or martial status.</p>
                  <p>We process the categories of personal information identified above for the purposes described in the <a href="#how_we_use">How We Use Your Information Collected</a> section above.</p>
                  <p>We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; and (3) other parties such as other users and universities.</p>
                  <p>We describe our information disclosure practices above in <a href="#when_we_disclose">When We Disclose Information</a>.</p>
                  <p><strong>âSaleâ and âsharingâ of personal information.</strong> The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that âsellâ or âshareâ personal information. We do not engage in such activity based on our understanding of the definitions of âsaleâ and âsharingâ under the CCPA and current guidance, and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. We do disclose information as outlined in this Policy, including with potential employers if you choose to participate in Piazza Network. Since we do not âsellâ or âshareâ personal information, we also do not knowingly âsellâ or âshareâ the personal information of children under 16.</p>

                  <h4><strong>California Privacy Rights </strong></h4>

                  <p>California residents can make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA. Specifically, if you are a California resident, you may request that we:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>provide you with information about: the categories of personal information we collect, disclose, âshare,â or âsellâ about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, âsharing,â or âsellingâ your personal information; and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose, âshare,â or âsellâ personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li>provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;</li>
                    <li>delete certain information we have about you;</li>
                    <li>correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you; and/or</li>
                    <li>provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we may retain certain information for legal compliance and to secure our Services. We may need certain information in order to provide the Services to you; if you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to use the Services.</p>
                  <p>The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p>
                  <p>If you would like information regarding your rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please click <a href="/legal/ccpa" target="_blank">here</a> to log into your account or contact us at <a href="mailto:ccpa@piazza.com">ccpa@piazza.com</a> or visit <a href="/legal/form" target="_blank">piazza.com/legal/form</a>.   To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity and requests before granting such requests.   </p>
                  <p>The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your âsensitive personal informationâ if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.</p>
                  <p><strong>Retention of Your Personal Information.</strong> Please see the <a href="#how_long">How Long We Keep Information</a> section above.</p>
                  <p><strong>Shine the Light Disclosure.</strong> The California âShine the Lightâ law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we disclose certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your consent.</p>

                  <h3>PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h3>
                  <p>Under Nevada law, Nevada consumers who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the âsaleâ of âcovered informationâ as such terms are defined under Nevada law. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a qualifying Nevada resident you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing privacy@piazza.com. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.</p>

                  <h3>PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR VIRGINIA RESIDENTS</h3>
                  <p>If you are a Virginia consumer (as that term is defined under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (âVCDPAâ)), you may have certain rights. Virginia law may permit you to request that we:</p>

                    <li>Correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information;</li>
                    <li>Delete your personal information;</li>
                    <li>Provide you a copy of personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business, where our processing is carried out by automated means; and</li>
                    <li>Opt you out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal information, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
