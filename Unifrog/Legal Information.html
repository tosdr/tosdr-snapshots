<p>Hi there, we&rsquo;re Unifrog Education Limited and this is our  privacy notice for you to read so you can see what we do with your information  on our website and our platform. </p>
<p>This is really important: if you are under 13, please check  that your parent or guardian is happy for you to use our website and our  platform.</p>
<p>When you use our platform, just make sure you only upload  information that you or your teachers need, don&rsquo;t upload any other information  about you or anyone else that isn&rsquo;t relevant to your education or future plans  for study or training. </p>
<p>We are responsible for how your information is used on the  Unifrog website and platform, so if you want to get in touch with us about this  for any reason, you can contact us by email or you can write to us at:</p>
<p><a name="_Hlk81824538" id="_Hlk81824538"></a><a href="mailto:info@unifrog.org">info@unifrog.org </a> <br />
  Unit 215, Brickfields, 37 Cremer Street, London, E2 8HD</p>
<p>This privacy notice is only for Unifrog&rsquo;s website and  platform. If you click on any links on our website to another website, you will  need to check their privacy notice to find out what they do with your  information. </p>
<p>You will be using our platform to help you with your  education and your preparation for future jobs and applications. Your teachers  will also be using the platform and they will be able to communicate with you  and look at the information and comment on it. This privacy notice tells you  how we collect and use the information we hold about you. </p>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">1. Information we collect about you</h2>
<p><strong>1.1 The information we receive from you.</strong></p>
<p>When you use our platform  you will give us the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your name, email address, date of birth,  postcode and your username and password (gender is optional);</li>
  <li>the name of your school and the closest city to  your school;</li>
  <li>information about your schoolwork;</li>
  <li>any information you put on the platform about  your experiences and information you want to put into future applications;</li>
  <li>details of what and where you might want to  study in the future; </li>
  <li>your essays, CV and personal statement for  university applications;</li>
  <li>details of other people that you put on the  platform, e.g. referees or people you send your CV to (you must get their  consent before giving us that information); and</li>
  <li>any information you give us after you have left  school (e.g. your further education or employment). </li>
</ul>
<p>You may also upload information about your interests,  hobbies, activities, work experience placements and other information that is  relevant to your use of the platform.</p>
<p>We will also collect information about when and how you use  the website and the platform, e.g. the pages you visit and any links you access  and information about which town or village you are in when you use the  platform, as well as other technical information e.g. about the type of device  you use, your IP address and network information. Most of this information is  then anonymised so it cannot be linked to you. </p>
<p>We use cookies to get some of this information. Cookies are  small files of data that operate on our website. If you would like more  information about these, you can look at our <a href="/website-terms#s3">Cookie Policy here</a></p>

      <p><strong>1.2 Information we receive from your school. </strong></p>

<p>Your school will also upload information about you to our  platform about your education, performance, further education and career  opportunities.  </p>
<p>Your school might also include ethnic and disability information,  whether you have any special educational needs and any other details that might  affect the way you learn, for the school&rsquo;s internal reporting.  We might make this information anonymous (so  that you can&rsquo;t be identified) and add it to a statistical report about how  different groups of students use our platform and what they go on to do after  they leave school.   </p>
<p>Your school may tell us what course or job you do after you  leave school.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">2. How  we use your information</h2>
<p><strong>2.1 When we use your information.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we  have listed in the section above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when we have asked you, and you have agreed; or</li>
  <li>where we think it is fair for us to use it.</li>
</ul>

 <p><strong>2.2 Why we use your information.</strong></p>
<p>We use your information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help you use our website and our platform  securely and send information to you so that you can use the platform; </li>
  <li>work out how students use our website and platform  (including different student groups) so that we can improve our service;</li>
  <li>make suggestions to you about what you might  like to see and what might interest you;</li>
  <li>enable your teachers to see your progress, and  to communicate with you, and so your school can decide how the platform can  work better for future students;</li>
  <li>to reply to any questions you might have and to  obtain your views; and</li>
  <li>make sure that we run our website and platform  properly and lawfully.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">3. Sharing  your information</h2>
<p>We  share your information with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>other companies who help us run our business and  operate our website and our platform;</li>
  <li>your teachers and your school so that you can  talk to each other on the platform about your schoolwork, your experiences and  interests.  If you agree, your school  might see information you give us after you have left school. </li>
  <li>other teachers, e.g. your school might put  information on the platform that only other teachers can see (but if you want  to see it you can ask us - we talk about that more under Your rights below);</li>
  <li>companies who help us run surveys about your use  of our platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">4. Where  we keep your information</h2>
<p align="left">We are based in England.&nbsp; If  your school is in the UK or Europe, we will keep all of your information in the  UK or Europe. If your school is outside Europe, we will transfer your  information safely when we send it back to you or your school. </p>
<p align="left"> If you choose to complete a survey on  our platform where we use the third party SurveyMonkey, SurveyMonkey will  transfer your information to the US and store it there.  Information is not protected in the US in the  same way as it is in the UK/EU, so SurveyMonkey have  agreed that they will increase the protection for your information. </p>
<p align="left">  We make sure your information is safe  and secure and keep your account open for as long as you use the platform. If  you don&rsquo;t use the platform for 4 years we will delete your account.</p>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">5.	Who else may collect my information?</h2>
<p align="left">When using our  platform, you may come across links to other websites that are not controlled  by Unifrog e.g. Google Drive or Dropbox which let you upload items to our  platform, and SurveyMonkey, mentioned above. </p>
<p align="left"> If you choose to  use these websites or apps, they may use their own cookies to collect  information about your use of our platform and their website. They might also use cookies to find out your device&rsquo;s location  and send you marketing information. You should check their privacy notices and  cookie policies to find out more. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 txt-700">6. Your  rights </h2>
<p>You normally  have these rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to access your information or ask for a copy;</li>
  <li>to ask us to delete your information, to correct  it if it&rsquo;s wrong, to transfer it, or to ask us to stop doing something with the  information we hold about you;</li>
  <li>to ask us not to send things to you, or change  your mind if you have agreed that we can do something with your information  (e.g. sending you our newsletters); and</li>
  <li>to make a complaint to the office that protects  these rights in the UK (or where you live if you&rsquo;re somewhere else in Europe).  In the UK it is the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (<a href="http://www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p>If  you decide you no longer want to receive our newsletters or notifications you  can contact us (see below) or you can change your settings on the platform. </p>
