<p><strong>More about the information  we use and why </strong><strong>(this section only applies if you are in the EU/UK)</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Where we need consent to use your personal  information, we will clearly ask you for this – and you can withdraw that consent  at any time. For example, we may ask you to positively opt-in to us sending you  marketing communications when you first log in to your Unifrog account.</p>
<p>Where you provide  us with other people&rsquo;s personal information (for example, if you are a <strong>Student</strong> and you send someone else your  CV through the Unifrog Platform and you give us his or her e-mail address for  this purpose), <strong>you must obtain their  consent before doing so.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>When and why might you  share my personal information with others?</strong></p>
<p>  If you are a <strong>Student </strong>or <strong>Teacher</strong>,<strong> </strong>we need to share some of your personal information with your School  (including, as applicable, your Teachers or your Students). See below for more  details.</p>
<p> In addition, whether you are a <strong>Student</strong>, <strong>Teacher</strong>, <strong>Parent</strong> or <strong>Visitor</strong>, in order to operate the Unifrog Website and provide our services to you, we use carefully selected companies. In doing so, these companies may process your information.  </p>
<p> We make sure that these selected companies take  security measures to protect your information in line with our policies.  We do not allow them to use your personal  information for their own purposes and we only permit them to process your  personal information as is necessary and in accordance with our instructions. </p>
<p> In some circumstances, we may need to share  your personal information with a data protection regulator or in order to  comply with the law or a legal process. We  may also do so where we have another legitimate interest that is not outweighed by your interests and fundamental  rights (for example, to maintain the security of our computer systems).</p>
<p> <strong>Who will you share my  personal information with? </strong></p>
<p>  <strong>Students</strong></p>
<p> We will share some of your personal information with your School  (including your Teachers) so  that you and they can use the Unifrog Platform as intended. For example,  your Teachers will be able to see some of your information, including your  name, details of your education and academic performance, as well as any  further education and career opportunities which are of interest to you. They  will also be able to access and comment on your activities, skills and  interactions, and on any other information you upload or submit. We may also  share with your School details of any educational courses, open days,  internships, apprenticeships, job opportunities and other similar opportunities  offered by universities, other educational establishments and employers that are  available to you. </p>
<p> Your School and/or your Teachers may choose to upload certain types of  information to the Unifrog Platform which they do not want to share with you,  for example, opinions or comments on your activities, skills and  interactions which are only intended for other Teachers. For the same reason,  they may also choose to upload something to your locker, which you are not able  to see. This may include personal information about you. See <a href="#YOURRIGHTS">YOUR RIGHTS</a> for details on your right to access any personal  information which we hold about you. </p>
<p> If you  provide us with details of your referees, we will share your name with that  referee so that they can provide a reference about you. Similarly, if you send someone else details of your activities or  skills through the Unifrog Platform, we will send your name and those  details to that individual at your request. </p>
<p align="left">If your School has agreed for your School's  Unifrog subscription to be paid or part paid for by another entity, for example  an education foundation it belongs to, we may pass on to this entity  information allowing it to assess how much you have used the platform.</p>
<p align="left"> If your School&rsquo;s Unifrog account is integrated  with the Common<strong> </strong>App and you apply to universities via the Common App, The  Common Application, Inc. will receive some of your personal information  contained in your Unifrog account, including your name, email address, date of  birth, details of your education and academic performance. The Common  Application, Inc. will also be able to access personal information that is  contained in any document or application that is submitted by you, or by a  Teacher on your behalf, to the Common App via the Unifrog Platform.</p>
<p align="left"> If your School&rsquo;s Unifrog account is  integrated with Parchment and you or your Teachers submit a document from the  Unifrog Platform via Parchment to a university, Parchment LLC will receive some  of your personal information that is contained in your Unifrog account, including  your name and email address, as well as any personal information that is  contained in the document that you submit.</p>
<p align="left"> If you agree (by ticking the relevant  box when you complete your Unifrog account registration and log in to the  Unifrog Platform for the first time), we may share with your School some of  your information after you have left school so that your School can contact you  about its alumni programme. This includes your name, e-mail address, year of  leaving school, and details of any further education or employment you  undertake (or have undertaken). Your School will use this information to send  you school news; invitations to events; information about work experience, job  opportunities and fundraising; and requests to speak at its events, for  example. We will rely on your consent as the legal basis for sharing this  information with your School. You can withdraw your consent at any time by  changing the privacy settings of your Unifrog account, or by contacting us  (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unifrog.org/privacy-policy#HOWTOCONTACTUS">HOW TO CONTACT US</a>) or by notifying  your School, either by email or by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of  its messages.</p>

<p align="left">Unless you ask us not to, we will share some of your personal information with the Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT) to find out which university or other education provider you have enrolled with (if any), for the reasons mentioned above (see <a href="https://www.unifrog.org/privacy-policy#HOWWEUSEYOURINFORMATION">here</a>). HEAT may retain your data to enable statistical aggregation and analysis. Find HEAT's privacy policy <a href="https://heat.ac.uk/privacy-notice/">here</a>. If you enrol at a university or other education provider, we may remind this institution of any interactions you had with them on the Unifrog Platform before you applied to them.</p>


<p align="left"> Unless you ask us not to, we will  share some of your personal information with the Higher Education Access  Tracker to find out which university or other education provider you have  enrolled with (if any), for the reasons mentioned above (see <a href="https://www.unifrog.org/privacy-policy#HOWWEUSEYOURINFORMATION">here</a>) We may remind  your university of any interactions you had with them on the Unifrog Platform  before you applied to them.</p>
<p align="left"> We may share details of any further  education or employment you undertake with your Teachers so that they can see  how you progress after you have left school. Your School may analyse and  compare this information with similar (anonymised) information about Students  from other schools for its own internal reporting and analysis.</p>
<p align="left"> We will share your details with an  Employer if we are arranging a proposed work placement for you.</p>

<p align="left">If you have interacted on multiple occasions with an employer, university or other educational establishment on the Unifrog Platform or at one of our events, we may share your name, date of birth, Unifrog username, school leaving year, school name, school region and country and your interest with that organisation (although we will not share the details of your interactions). ‘Interacting’ with an organisation means shortlisting their opportunities (e.g. a course or apprenticeship), attending a webinar they are sponsoring, choosing to ‘connect’ with them, joining a Unifrog course that Employer or further education provider has sponsored and choosing to share your work with them, or favouriting an article on the Unifrog Platform which was sponsored by them. We share this information with the organisation so that if you are subsequently given an opportunity by them (e.g. enrolling on a course or apprenticeship), they can check whether you have interacted with them previously via Unifrog.</p>

<p align="left">Where you have given your consent to be contacted by an employer, university or other educational establishment about opportunities they offer, we will share your name, date of birth, Unifrog username, email address, school leaving year, school name, school region and country and (if you decide to provide it) your subject preference with them.</p>


<p> <strong>Teachers</strong></p>
<p align="left">We will share some of your personal  information with your School (including your Students and other Teachers) so  that you and they can use the Unifrog Platform as intended. For example, your  Students will be able to see some of your information, including your name,  details of the subject(s) you teach and the Students for whom you are  responsible. We will also share records of your interactions with Students  and/or your opinions, comments or recommendations, together with any items you  add to their lockers, if you choose to allow those Students to see this  information.</p>
<p align="left"> If you use the Common App via the  Unifrog Platform, The Common Application, Inc. will receive certain information  about you, including your name and the email address you use as your Unifrog  username. It  may use this information to  contact you in respect of the Common App service, for example regarding updates  to the online school forms system.</p>
<p align="left"> If your School uses Parchment via the  Unifrog Platform, Parchment LLC will receive certain information about you,  including your name and the email address you use as your Unifrog username.</p>
<p> <strong>Employers</strong></p>
<p>We will share your personal information with a Student and their Parent in relation to their proposed work placement.</p> 


<p>If you are a <strong>Student</strong> or <strong>Teacher</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when you complete a survey or questionnaire, our survey provider,  e.g. SurveyMonkey, may collect certain technical information, including data  about your device or browser (such as your geographic location based on your  device IP address) and data about pages you&rsquo;ve visited and files you&rsquo;ve viewed  on their website or app to analyse your usage patterns, and for troubleshooting  and bug fixing, for example. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our survey  provider, e.g. SurveyMonkey, may also collect personal information contained in  (or connected with) your survey or questionnaire responses, but this information  will be aggregated and anonymised before being processed any further, so that  it cannot be linked to you. </p>
<ul>
  <li>the information we share with your School may also be used by your School  and by us for analytical purposes and to help your School use the Unifrog  Platform, for example to give your School an impression of how it is supporting  its Students.   </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who else might obtain my personal information?</strong></p>
<p>  Whether  you are a <strong>Student</strong>, <strong>Teacher</strong>, <strong>Parent</strong> or <strong>Visitor</strong>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>we use Google Analytics to obtain  statistics and insights regarding  your access and use of the Unifrog Website (see <a href="#INFORMATIONPROVIDEDBYTHIRDPARTIES"><strong>Information provided by third parties</strong></a>). As the provider of that service, Google will  receive certain information about that access and use. This is  necessary so that we can understand how the Unifrog Website is used in order to improve it; and <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>other companies who  provide services to us may also access or receive some of your information.  For  example, we use a software  developer, <a href="https://www.sav.co.uk/">SAV London Ltd</a>, to help us to design and build the Unifrog Website. </li>

<p> Unfortunately the  transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your information,  we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted via the Unifrog  Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information,  we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent  unauthorised access. </p>

<p>To decide how long we keep your  information, we consider the type of information you give to us or which we  collect, and how sensitive that information is.   We also consider the risk of harm that might occur if the information  went missing or if somebody used it in a way they were not supposed to, for  example, and the reasons why we are using your information in the first place. </p>

<h3 class="p-t-3 p-b-2 txt-700" id="YOURRIGHTS">YOUR RIGHTS <strong class="txt-red">(this section only applies  if you are in the EU/UK)</strong></h3>

<p>  If you are in the  EU or UK, by law you have the following rights with regard to your personal  information: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Access</strong>. You have the right to obtain confirmation as to       whether or not your personal information is being processed, and, if it       is, request access to that personal information (commonly known as a &ldquo;data       subject access request&rdquo;). We will need you to prove your identity before       we release any personal information to you. In addition, we will normally contact your School to let them know you have made a data subject access request. It is our policy not to disclose references about Students given by their Teachers or others. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Correction or deletion</strong>. You have the right to ask us to correct or       delete any personal information that we hold about you (unless we have the       legal right to retain it). You also have the right to ask us to delete       your information where you have exercised your right to object to       processing (see below). <br />
    <br />
  </li>

  <li><strong>Objection</strong>. You have the right to object to  processing of your information where we are relying on a legitimate interest  and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to  object to processing on this ground.  You  also have the right to object where we are processing your information for  direct marketing purposes.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Restriction</strong>.  You also have the right to restrict us from processing your personal  information. You can ask us to temporarily stop processing information about  you, for example if you want us to establish that it is accurate or the reason  for processing it.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Change of preferences</strong>. You can change your information processing       preferences at any time. For example, if you have given your consent to us       to make suggestions and recommendations to you about educational courses,       job opportunities, internships, open days, <em>etc</em>, but have changed your mind, you can contact us using the       details provided below or clicking the relevant link in any communication       you receive (where this specifically relates to marketing messages, see <a href="#MARKETING">MARKETING</a>).<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data portability. </strong>In some circumstances, you have the right<strong> </strong>to ask us transfer a copy of the personal       information we hold about you to someone else.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that  if you ask us to stop processing your personal information in a certain way or if  you ask us to delete your information, and we need to use that information to  provide the Unifrog Website to you, then you may not be able to continue to use  it.  This does not include your right to  object to direct marketing, which can be exercised at any time without  restriction. </p>
<p> If you would like  to exercise any of the rights mentioned above, please contact us (see <a href="#HOWTOCONTACTUS">HOW TO  CONTACT US</a>).</p>

<p>The above rights do not apply to anonymised personal information.</p>

<p> <strong>No fee usually required to access your personal  information</strong></p>
<p>  You will not normally  have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of  the other rights set out above).  However,  we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unreasonable or  excessive.  Alternatively, we can refuse  to comply with the request.</p>
<p> <strong>What we may need from you</strong></p>
<p>  We may need to  request specific information from you to confirm your identity and verify your  right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is another appropriate security measure  to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no  right to receive it.</p>
<p> <strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong></p>
<p>  Where you have  consented to the collection, use or transfer of your personal information for a  specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific  processing at any time.  To withdraw your  consent, please contact us (see <a href="#HOWTOCONTACTUS">HOW TO  CONTACT US</a>).  Once we have received notification that you  have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the  purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate  basis for doing so in law.</p>
