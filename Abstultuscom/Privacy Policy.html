<h1>SECURITY</h1>
<p>Personal information provided on the website and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server. We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security. We take appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Our website uses encryption technology, like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL/TLS encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number. Our Customer Care center and other administrative offices also operate over private and secure networks. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.</p>
<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>This website ("website") is operated by Abstultus Technologies, LLC. This privacy policy only covers information collected at this website, and does not cover any information collected offline by Abstultus Technologies, LLC.

<p><span class="abs-subchapter-header">Business Transitions:</span> We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Abstultus Technologies or one of its properties, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Abstultus Technologies to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. Abstultus Technologies specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.</p>
<p><span class="abs-subchapter-header">Compliance with Law:</span> We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability, and to protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the public.</p>
<p>Abstultus Technologies may partner with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This technology involves the use of third party cookies which allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you. You may choose to opt-out of this service we have with our third-party advertising partner. We may also use Abstultus Technologies cookies to provide similar enhanced online marketing to you based on your interests and preferences. You may also choose to opt out of these enhanced online marketing ads.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">YOUR CHOICES REGARDING USE OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span><br />
We provide you with a number of choices regarding our handling of your nonpublic personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><span class="abs-subchapter-header">Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing:</span> If you purchase products or services from Abstultus Technologies and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either write to Abstultus Technologies Customer Care at 519 Somerville Ave, Ste #137, Somerville, MA 02143 or call (617) 778-6021. If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, and email address (the one used to register your account), and state one of the following:<br />
"NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail);<br />
"NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone); or<br />
"NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive either).</p>
<p>Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</span><br />
Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Abstultus Technologies Customer Care, 519 Somerville Ave, Ste #137, Somerville, MA 02143 or call (617) 778-6021. Please allow 30 days for a response.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND HOW WE USE THEM</span><br />
A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer or mobile device [hard drive]. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or "clear gif" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.</p>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to the Abstultus Technologies website. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you.</p>
<p>We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">ONLINE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</span><br />
To make your experience faster and easier, you may need to register on the Abstultus Technologies website. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.</p>
<p>If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">EMAILS</span><br />
You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from Abstultus Technologies or its affiliates you can click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us. Please allow us 3 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">ACCEPTANCE</span><br />
By using this website, you accept the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span class="abs-chapter-header">ANY QUESTIONS?</span><br />
We'll be happy to provide additional information or answer any questions. Please:</p>
