Offerings</h2><p>i. <em>This Section explains more about the Offerings, including updates to such offerings and linkages with other third party integration software that we make available to you.

You acknowledge and agree that any obligation we may have to support previous version(s) of any Offering may end when we release an update, upgrade, and/or additional feature for the Offering. The license granted for a Subscription shall apply to any updates, upgrades, and/or additional features that are not distributed with a separate license or other agreement. If we make any material changes to an Offering, we will notify you within the Offering interface or by sending you an email.</p><p>With respect to an Offering accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Microsoft Store (each, an “App Store”) (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App Store Sourced Application is dependent on the App Store.</p><h3>2.2 Downtime and Suspension of Offerings</h3><p>You acknowledge that you may experience downtime (a) as a result of our conducting maintenance; or (b) in connection with a force majeure event (as described in Section 16.5).

Because you control whether to integrate and use an Integration Offering, you are solely responsible for all interactions with the Integration Offering, including ensuring appropriate privacy, contractual, and other protections with it as well as ensuring that you are complying with any terms you are required to agree with the provider of such Integration Offering. Integration Offerings are not “Offerings” under this Agreement and are not subject to any of the warranties, service commitments or other obligations with respect to Offerings hereunder. The availability of any Integration Offering through any of our Offerings does not imply our endorsement of or affiliation with the provider of such Integration Offering. We do not control any Integration Offering and will have no liability to you in connection with any Integration Offering. We have no obligation to monitor or maintain access to Integration Offerings, and may disable the ability to integrate with them or restrict access to any Integration Offerings at any time, with or without notice to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances). By using or enabling any Integration Offering, you are expressly permitting us and our Affiliates to disclose your School Profile Information, and, to the extent applicable to your Offering, your Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Association Information or other information, including support requests and Log and Cookie Information to the extent necessary to utilize the Integration Offering.

We are not responsible for, and School expressly waives any claim for liability against the Liminex Parties related to, any student or other individual’s death, illness, bodily injury, disability, emotional distress or other outcome. To the maximum extent permissible by law, such waiver shall extend to any School personnel, student, student family, estate or other third parties. To the extent that any Liminex Party is made a party to any dispute related to any such death, illness, bodily injury, disability, or other outcome, School shall indemnify us in accordance with Section 13, below.</p><h3>3.3 General Acceptable Use Policy</h3><p>We need your help to ensure that the Offerings are used safely and appropriately.

Special Terms for Free, Trial and Beta Offerings</h2><p>i. <em>This Section explains that we may make free, trial, or beta offerings available for you to test and provide us with Feedback about whether an Offering meets your needs. Because these Offerings are different from paid Subscriptions, there are special terms for them.</em></p><h3>4.1 Free or Trial Subscriptions</h3><p>If we make an Offering available to you on a free or trial basis, it is so you can use the Offering before purchasing a Subscription to determine if it meets your needs.

If you receive an alert and/or gain access to any information that triggers a legal obligation, such as a reporting or intervention duty for you (including, for an example, an alert from a GoGuardian Offering that one of your students is potentially at risk of suicide), it is your sole responsibility to fulfill that legal obligation and take any additional, responsible actions necessary to safeguard the students in compliance with Applicable Law. In addition, to the extent you elect not to receive one or more types of alerts and/or notifications in your settings, you are solely responsible for that decision. Unless otherwise specified in the Supplemental Terms, we do not review alerts generated through any of the Offerings or take any action based on these alerts or review your settings.</p><p>Your escalation and notification list for such alert and/or notification feature in your account for a particular GoGuardian Offering may change from time to time, including because contact information changes (e.g., changes in School Profile Information, its Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information (e.g., contact information, including an Authorized User’s email address, or changes in Parent/Guardian Information ), and Association Information, including, for example, the relationship of an Authorized School Personnel or a guardian/parent to a child/student changes (e.g., change in guardianship or educational rights holder). Without limiting the generality of Section 1.2.1, it is important that you maintain accurate and up-to-date Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information to ensure the appropriateness and timeliness of any alerts and notifications generated through a GoGuardian Offering. It is also important that you remind parents/guardians to update School of any changes, including contact information and guardianship.</p><p>Additionally, without limiting the generality of the other terms of this Agreement, if your School uses GoGuardian Beacon or GoGuardian Admin (the self harm smart alerts or Beacon starter function), your School represents and warrants that your School: (1) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, an up-to-date and easily available suicide prevention policy; (2) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, a necessary suicide prevention program; and (3) your School will notify parents/guardians about your School’s adoption of GoGuardian Beacon and educate them about suicide prevention (including, suicide risk factors, warning signs, and resources) before enabling the Guardian Notification feature (or similar functionality) of GoGuardian Beacon or GoGuardian Admin (the self harm smart alerts or Beacon starter function).</p><h2>10.

If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution, domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different choice of law other than California law, then School’s state’s law will apply.

This notice must include a brief written statement with the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the Claim and the relief requested. You must send any such notice to Liminex by email to legal@goguardian.com AND by U.S. Mail to Liminex, 2030 E Maple Ave Suite 100, El Segundo, CA 90245. If we have your contact information, we will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail and your email address.</p><p>The parties shall use reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve any Claim through consultation and good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of a Claim is sent. After thirty (30) days, you or we may resort to the other alternatives described in Section 15.2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice requirement in this section and the 30-day negotiation period required shall not apply to Claims involving patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade secrets or piracy or unauthorized use of an Offering.</p><h4>15.2.1</h4><p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong><em> Arbitration Rules and Forum</em> Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any Claims between you and us, if unresolved through informal consultation and negotiation pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in Los Angeles, California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different location for arbitration other than Los Angeles, California, then School’s state’s required location for binding arbitration will apply. If School that is a United States public and accredited educational institution and your consent to binding arbitration is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state within the United States in which School’s educational institution is domiciled, then this Section is hereby waived. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (collectively, “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules and fee information are available at www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of each party. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.</p><p><em>Exceptions: </em>Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims  concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and Claims of piracy or unauthorized use of any Offering shall not be subject to arbitration under this Section 15.2.1. In addition, the parties may choose to pursue a Claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over the parties otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where the Claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</p><p><em>Authority of Arbitrator: </em>In binding arbitration, the arbitrator shall have the authority (a) to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim; (b) to award monetary damages; and (c) to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under Applicable Law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p><p><em>Confidentiality: </em>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent either party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p><h4>15.2.2</h4><p><strong>Class Action Waiver. </strong>THE PARTIES<strong> </strong> HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. The parties are instead electing that all Claims not otherwise resolved informally as permitted above shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><h2>16. <strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h2><h3>16.1 Changes to this Agreement</h3><p>Before we make a material change to this Agreement, we will notify you as described in this Section.
