These Workplace ToS shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Workplace ToS evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and law of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted applicable law. If the FAA is found not to apply any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the laws of the U.S. state where you live, or the jurisdiction mutually agreed in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data, data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA, is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable. These Workplace ToS were drafted in the English language and this English language version of these Workplace ToS is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Workplace ToS and any translation, the English version will prevail.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-25-2-arbitration">25.2<strong> Arbitration</strong></h5>



<p>(a)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> General.</span> READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WHEN I WORK. This Section (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (1) these Workplace ToS, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (2) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (3) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (4) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a Workplace or consumer (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>,” and, collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Workplace ToS.</p>



<p>(b)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement.</span> If you are a new Workplace, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Workplace ToS by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@wheniwork.com">support@wheniwork.com</a> with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Workplace ToS including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.</p>



<p>(c)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Dispute Resolution Process.</span> For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wheniwork.com">support@wheniwork.com</a> and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that When I Work has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim by binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. County where your principal offices are or Hennepin County, Minnesota, unless you and When I Work agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (1) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (2) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (3) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Workplace ToS are, or whether any provision of these Workplace ToS is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>



<p>(d) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equitable Relief.</span> NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA, DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>



<p>(e) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Severability. </span>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Section 20.3 (Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver) is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>

<p>(b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WIW’s use of Third-Party Service Providers. </span>WIW’s Payroll Services are powered by Check Technologies, Inc.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our data security, confidential information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.

This Section 17(B) (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (1) these User ToS, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (2) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (3) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (4) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a “Claim,” and, collectively, “Claims”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these User ToS.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. </span>If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these User ToS by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@wheniwork.com">support@wheniwork.com</a> with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these User ToS, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(c) Dispute Resolution Process.</span> For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@wheniwork.com">support@wheniwork.com</a>&nbsp;and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that When I Work has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim by binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. County where you live or Hennepin County, Minnesota, unless you and When I Work agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (1) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (2) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (3) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these User ToS are, or whether any provision of these User ToS is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(d) Equitable Relief. </span>NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(e) Severability.</span> If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Section 16.3 (Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver) is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
