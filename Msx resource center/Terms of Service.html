      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p> Welcome to the MSX Resource Center website! The MSX Resource Center  website is your one-stop MSX source of MSX news, information and  discussions on the web. We hope you will enjoy our services, but do ask  you to take the following into account when using our site. Upon using  our site, you declare to have read the following carefully, and to agree  with its contents. Use of our site is subject to our policies and this  agreement between you (the User or Member) and the MSX Resource Center  Foundation (MRC).</p>
<p> These policies and the present agreement apply to all websites in the msx.org domain, such as <a href=""><b><a href="http://www.msx.org">www.msx.org</a></b></a>, <a href=""><b>nl.msx.org</b></a>, etcetera. This agreement also covers any future domains and/or services unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p> These policies were not made to limit you in any way, nor to detract  from the fun and enjoyment we hope you will have when using our site.  They are merely made to protect the MRC and its users from people that  may have less than honorable intentions.</p>
<p> <b>Acceptance</b></p>
<p> Upon using our site, you declare to have read the following carefully  and to have agreed with its contents. You also declare to periodically  check the policies for changes. Minors, under the age of 18, are not our  target group, and our site may therefore contain material that is not  adequate for underage viewers. This material may include, but is not  limited to, harsh language, sexually explicit terms, graphic material  with full or partial nudity, animated violence and other types of  potentially objectionable material. We suggest parents use their  judgement to supervise the use of this site or disallow it altogether.</p>
<p> <b>Services</b></p>
<p> The MRC website is made and maintained by a group of dedicated  volunteers as a free service to people of the MSX community. Members of  the MRC staff are not professionally trained, and do not receive  financial compensation for their efforts. This means that a website such  as the MRC website may be more prone to errors and/or  incorrect/inappropriate content than websites maintained by  professionals. Apart from human error, the MRC website may also suffer  from technical difficulties, which may or may not affect the  accessibility of the site. While the MRC considers all the content  stored on its site as particularly valuable, technical difficulties can  corrupt and/or erase this data. While efforts are made to prevent such a  loss, MRC cannot, in any event, be held responsible for the loss of  content. The services provided by MRC are provided AS IS, and may be  temporarily or permanently suspended at any time without prior notice.</p>
<p> <b>1 - General Rulings</b></p>
<p> <b>1.1</b> MRC is a free service provided by the MRC Foundation. Anyone  may use the services provided by the MRC website, unless access or usage  has been denied by the MRC. When using the MRC website and/or  downloading files of its server by any means, you are bound to this  agreement and these policies and agree to act accordingly.</p>
<p> <b>1.2</b> By becoming a member of the MRC, by means of opening a user  account, you gain access to members-only facilities such as our forums.  Anyone may become a member of the MRC, unless access or usage has been  denied by the MRC. Membership is free. It is not required to donate to  become a member, nor will donating members enjoy other  facilities/treatment than non-donating members.</p>
<p> <b>1.3</b> The MRC Foundation preserves the right to deny usage of the  MRC and/or restrict access to the MRC website without prior notice  and/or justification. Members of the MRC may cancel their membership at  any time, by contacting the MRC Foundation using the email address <a href="mailto:contact@msx.org"><b>contact@msx.org</b></a>. Although an account may be cancelled, no content submitted using that account will be removed from the MRC as stated in 2.1.</p>
<p> <b>1.4</b> By disagreeing with this agreement/these policies you agree  to cease using the MRC and its services immediately. This policy will  stay in effect, even if you disagree with the terms of the agreement.  Disagreeing with the agreement/these policies does not grant you any  rights to violate the rulings of these policies.</p>
<p> <b>2 - Submitted Content</b></p>
<p> <b>2.1</b> Content submitted to the MRC remains copyright of the  author/copyright owner. Any user submitting content to the MRC to which  they do not have the copyrights must have approval of the copyright  owner at the time the content is submitted. Once content has been  submitted to the MRC, the author/copyright owner agree to irrevocably  allow the MRC to have this content displayed online and/or available for  download. This ruling is solely meant to protect the archival value of  the MRC, and to prevent disruption of the integrity of the content of  the MRC.</p>
<p> <b>2.2</b> A User is responsible for any content submitted through his  or her account. A User is fully responsible for any damages caused by  his or her own actions. In case of fraud by the submitting user, the MRC  cannot be held responsible in any event.</p>

<p> <b>3 - Copyrights</b></p>

It is prohibited to re-use, copy, sell, or  reproduce in any form whatsoever the content as described. Partial  copying of news is allowed only if MRC is mentioned as source, and only  when the complete URL, <a href=""><b><a href="http://www.msx.org">www.msx.org</a></b></a>, to the MRC is published with it.</p>
<p> <b>3.2</b> MRC does not claim any copyrights to user submitted content.  In accordance with 2.1 however, MRC may publish submitted content,  without limitation, at its own discretion, in any form available.</p>
<p> <b>4 - Forum Use</b></p>
<p> <b>4.1</b> When using the forums of the MRC website, the member agrees  to abide by the following policies. Failure to do so may result in the  removal of posted messages and/or denial of access/use of the MRC  services. MRC may moderate their forums at their own discretion, as the  staff members of the MRC see fit. MRC cannot be held responsible for the  posted content by other members.</p>
<p> <b>4.2</b> Members using the forums on the MRC website must agree to abide by the following rules:</p>

</ul>
<p><b>4.3</b> Submissions to the forums will not be considered by the MRC as  copyrighted material. When posting on our forums you declare to agree  with this. You may quote from copyrighted material as far as the 'fair  use' clause of the copyrighted material allows this, but only when  clearly indicating the copyright information of the original  author/copyright owner.</p>
<p> <b>4.4</b> Although MRC staff have some tolerance for 'heated  discussions', you agree to keep 'flaming' to a minimum. Refrain from  using strong words, and remember you are dealing with real people with  real feelings. Remarks deemed as particularly offensive may be moderated  by MRC staff at their discretion.</p>
<p> <b>4.5</b> Content submitted to the MRC forums becomes part of the MRC  archive of content as described in 2.1 and will form part of the MRC as a  whole. Once submitted, you understand that the content you have posted  will remain on the MRC website indefinitely. At no time shall MRC be  required to remove content from their forums unless the MRC staff feels  this is appropriate.</p>
<p> <b>4.6</b> Repeated abuse of the forums and/or general disregard of our  forum policies may lead to the removal of posted messages and/or denial  of access/use of the MRC services.</p>
