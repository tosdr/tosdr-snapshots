You must not post content to Your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others. iNaturalist may, at its discretion, change or remove any content that it considers inappropriate or unlawful.

    <p>
      <strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> If You post material to the Platform, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Platform (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from Your use of, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. If you own the Content prior to contributing the Content to the Site, and that Content is subject to Intellectual Property rights, you retain ownership of those rights.  Unless you specify otherwise when you post Content, you agree to license Content you contribute to the Platform under the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial license (CC BY-NC).
    </p>
    <p>
      By making Content available, You represent and warrant that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          the Content is not spam and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You will post only Content that is relevant to iNaturalist and at a rate and volume that does not hinder other Users' ability to use iNaturalist;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          the Content is not libelous or defamatory, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your account details do not mislead others into thinking they represent another specific person or organization (unique pseudonyms are allowed). For example, Your login name is not the name of a person other than Yourself or company other than Your own;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your content is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, journals and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By submitting Content to iNaturalist for inclusion on the Platform, You grant iNaturalist a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting Your observations and journal via iNaturalist, and for the purpose of displaying or promoting the Content or iNaturalist itself in other venues, such as social media or software distribution platforms.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
