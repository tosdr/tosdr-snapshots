<p class="">These TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the “Agreement”) govern your use of the retail field communication service provided as an online, hosted solution, which may also be provided through a mobile application, (the “Service”) offered by Retail Zipline, Inc. (“Zipline”, “we” or “us”). Specific business terms associated with your subscription to the Service will be an order form executed by the parties that reference this Agreement (“Order Form”). This Agreement governs all Order Forms; any conflicting or additional terms, conditions, or obligations are of no force or effect unless agreed to in a writing signed by the parties. This Agreement is a legally binding contract between the entity accepting it (“you” or “your” or “Client”) and Zipline and is effective as long as any Order Form remains in effect. This Agreement is applicable to (a) the Client who initially sets up the Service and other employees that are granted ownership privileges by you, (b) employees who manage and run your organization that will publish information through the Service (“Publishers”), and c) employees who consume the information published through the Service by Publishers (“Members”). This Agreement must be accepted prior to accessing or using the Service. Do not access or use the Service if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<ol role="list">
<li><strong>Scope of the Services</strong>. In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Service will be available to the Publishers and Members you authorize to use the service (collectively, “<strong>Users</strong>”). Your Users may use and have access to the Service and the associated generally published technical documentation for the Service (“<strong>Documentation</strong>”) provided such use and access is for your own internal business operations (and not for the benefit of a third party). If there are restrictions on your use of the Service, such as a limitation on the number or types of registered Users that may use the Service such restrictions will be in the applicable Order Form; you agree to use and access the Service in compliance with those restrictions. For the avoidance of doubt this Agreement only permits you to access and use the Service and you will not receive or have access to a copy of the code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the “<strong>Software</strong>”) or receive a copy of the Service itself.</li>

<li><strong>Updates</strong>. As our business evolves, Zipline may change this Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation. If we make a material change to the Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation we will provide you with reasonable prior notice either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice in the Service. You can review the most current version of the Agreement at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date they are posted at this page, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.

The Receiving Party also agrees that, even within the Receiving Party, Confidential Information will be disseminated only to those employees, officers and directors with a clear and well-defined “need to know” purpose and who are informed of and bound by the obligations of this Agreement or a substantially similar agreement with terms just as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as the terms of this Agreement.

You may, from time to time, provide suggestions, comments or other feedback with respect to the Service, the Professional Services, or the support services provided hereunder (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”).

Feedback, even if you designate it as confidential, will not be deemed to constitute Confidential Information or to impose any confidentiality obligations on Zipline. You grant Zipline a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license to use or incorporate into the Service or Professional Services any Feedback you or your Users provide. You agree that we are free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit any Feedback as we sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.c. <em>Data Collection</em>. As part of its Service, Zipline collects certain information relating to the use and performance of the Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Zipline will have the right to collect and analyze such data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Service and related systems and technologies and Zipline will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i) use such information and data to improve and enhance the Service and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the Service and other of our offerings, and (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form in connection with our business. Zipline agrees that it will not use the data described in this Section in any manner that identifies you as a customer or user of the Service.</li>

If you are required to pay any Taxes, you will pay such Taxes with no reduction or offset in the Fees payable to Zipline hereunder. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible, you agree to pay such Taxes and we will charge your payment instrument or invoice the appropriate amount to be paid by you.d. <em>Overdue Fees</em>. Overdue Fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. If you fail to pay any invoices in accordance with Section 13.2, we may suspend your use of and access to the Service pending payment of such overdue invoices; provided that we give you notice of such non-payment and ten (10) days (from the date of such notice) to remit the overdue fees in full. If you believe that we have billed you incorrectly, you must contact us no later than sixty (60) days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit.e. <em>Remote Audit</em>. You understand that you may pay for the Service on a per-User basis. If your use of or payment for the Service is on a per-User basis, you agree to allow us to conduct periodic remote audits, including, but not limited to system scans, to verify your compliance with the provisions and restrictions of this Agreement. &nbsp;If such audit should disclose any unlicensed usage or unpaid fees, you will pay all amounts rightfully due to us together with interest at the rate of one and 1.5% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, from the date on which such amount became due. If such audit should disclose any payments owed in an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the Fees, then you will pay any and all costs associated with the audit. Client shall remit any payments due to Zipline under this Section within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of such payment.</li>
<li><strong>Term and Termination</strong>.a. <em>Term and Renewal</em>. This Agreement is for the initial term stated on the Order Form and will be automatically renewed for additional periods equal to the renewal term set forth in the Order Form (collectively the “<strong>Term</strong>”), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Term.b. <em>Termination for Cause</em>. In addition to any other remedies either party may have, each party may also terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days’ (10 days in the event of non-payment) after notice.c. <em>Effect of Termination</em>. Upon non-renewal or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you agree to pay in full for the Service up to and including the last day on which the Service is provided. If termination is due to our uncured breach, we will refund any pre-paid unused Fees to you within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination of this Agreement. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, you agree to cease all use of the Service and associated documentation, installed or otherwise, and destroy all copies of any Software, deliverables and accompanying Documentation that are in your possession or under your control. Upon any termination, we will make all Content available to you for a period of thirty (30) days, but thereafter we may, but are not obligated to, delete stored Content.<br>‍<br>d. <em>Survival</em>. Sections 9, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13 (Section 13 only as to amounts due and owing), 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.2 will survive the non-renewal or termination of this Agreement.</li>

The foregoing limited warranty does not cover issues or failure resulting from abuse, misuse, alteration, acts of nature or disaster, unauthorized repair or installation, or use of the Service or the Software on or in connection with any hardware or software not specified in the Documentation. Zipline’s sole liability (and your sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, in our sole discretion and at no charge to you to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an error correction or work-around that corrects the reported non-conformity if the breach of warranty concerns the Service or to re-perform the Professional Services if the breach of warranty concerns the Professional Services or support services or, if we determine such remedies to be impracticable, (b) allow you to terminate and receive as you sole remedy any prepaid fees for the remainder of any then current Term after the effective date of termination.
