    <h2 id="section1">1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        InnoGames GmbH (“InnoGames”, “We”, “Us”) is the data controller in respect of your personal data and is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal data when you visit one of our websites, install one of our mobile apps and interact with our social media presences (together the “Services”). This Privacy Notice will help you understand what personal data we collect about you, why we collect it, how we process it and when we delete it.

However, if you do reside outside the European Union and use our Services, we may apply additional standards to you as required by local law.

We like to see ourselves as a small gaming village in which we strive together to make great games. You will find more information about the ways we process data as a group on Title 20 "Group Cooperations."

    </p>

    <h2 id="section4">4. General information on data processing  </h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of data processing  </h3>

    <p>
		In general, we process only the personal data which you disclose to us when using one of our Services. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. When you register as a user on one of our websites or in one of our apps, you only have to provide a username, email address and, if applicable, a password. When registering for certain Services such as mobile apps, usernames and email addresses are not collected during registration but only later during the use of the Service. We always store the password you have chosen in hashed form, which never allows for an inference of the actual password.</p>
    <p>
        In the context of implementing a contract you have concluded with us, particularly in the context of fee-based Services you have chosen, the disclosure of further data, such as your full name, physical address, payment information may be required. It is sometimes also necessary to request further personal data for the purposes of processing your inquiries or providing you with support. InnoGames will handle this data confidentially and in compliance with the applicable data privacy provisions. As a matter of principle, InnoGames will not disclose personal data to third parties without your consent, unless there is a specific legal basis of doing so. 
	</p>
    <h3>2. Legal basis for personal data processing</h3>

    <p>
       Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) serves as the legal basis for personal data processing.
    </p>
    <p>
       In personal data processing required for the fulfilment of a contract of which the data subject is a party, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to the processing required in order to carry out pre-contractual actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Insofar as personal data processing is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
       In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require personal data processing, Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
       If processing is required to protect the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the interests mentioned first, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing. 
    </p>

    <h3>3. Deletion of data and duration of storage</h3>

    <p>
       The personal data of the data subject are deleted or anonymized as soon as the purpose of storage no longer exists. In addition, such storage may occur if this is provided for by the EU law or Member State laws to which we are subject. The deletion or anonymization of data also occurs when the storage period prescribed in the abovementioned laws lapses, unless further storage of the data is required for conclusion or fulfilment of a contract. 
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data security</h3>

    <p>
       InnoGames makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data as well as unauthorized use or falsification of these data and to minimize the corresponding risks. However, the provision of personal data, whether it be in person, over the phone or over the Internet, always involves risks and no technological system is completely free of the possibility of being manipulated or sabotaged.
    </p>
    <p>
       InnoGames processes the information collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law. All employees are obliged to comply with data secrecy and data protection provisions and are instructed in this regard. Your data are transmitted in an encrypted form using the SSL method.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Provision of our websites, mobile apps and forums; creation of log files</h2>
    
 	<h3>A) Games</h3>
	 
    <h4>1. Description and scope of data processing</h4>
  	
    <p>
      You can play our games via the website, mobile app, or both. Each time one of our websites or mobile apps is accessed, our system automatically collects data from the system of the accessing device.
  	</p>
  	<p>
      When accessing a website, the following data is collected:
  	</p>
  
  	<ul>
        <li>Internet protocol and IP address,</li>
        <li>URL of the referring website from which the file was requested (if transferred),</li>
        <li>Name, version, and language of the operating system and browser,</li>
        <li>Supported techniques and formats (e.g., cookies, Java),</li>
        <li>The pages visited by you on the website,</li>
        <li>Date and time of access and type of HTML requests,</li>
        <li>Amount of transferred data,</li>
        <li>Access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>
        <li>Duration and frequency of use.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
     When accessing a mobile app, the following data is collected:
  </p>

  <ul>
        <li>Internet protocol and IP address,</li>
        <li>Device type including display resolution, size, and pixel density,</li>
        <li>Name and version, and language of the operating system,</li>
        <li>Marketing identifier such as IDFA or GAID (if permission to access is granted),</li>
        <li>Store identifier such as Game Center ID or Google Play ID (if downloaded from the app store),</li>
        <li>Date and time of access,</li>
        <li>Amount of transferred data,</li>
        <li>Access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>
        <li>Duration and frequency of use.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
     The date, time, and IP address are also stored in the log files. If an error occurs during the use of our websites or mobile apps and we want to rectify this, we may also collect other data, e.g., Player ID and username.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2. Purpose of data processing</h4>
  <p>
      To allow delivery of the website or mobile app to the user's computer, your IP address must be stored for the duration of the session. In addition, we store your IP address and log files to ensure the functionality of the website or mobile app, to optimize the website/app, and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
  </p>
  <p>
      Moreover, InnoGames reserves the right to store IP addresses and log files and to monitor compliance with our Terms of Service and Game Rules ("Breach of the Terms”). Particularly in this case, the data is used to prevent any cases of abuse or to resolve them in or outside of a court of law (“Legal Dispute”), and, on a case-by-case basis, to pass on the data for this purpose to investigative authorities. Apart from that, any other analysis of data is done in anonymous form as much as possible. After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution- and abuse investigation proceedings pending.
  </p>
  
  <h4>3. Legal basis for data processing</h4>
  
  <p>
     The legal basis for this processing is legitimate interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
  </p>
  
  <h4>4. Storage duration of data</h4>
  
  <p>
     The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfill the purpose of their collection. In the case when data are collected for the purpose of making the website or mobile app available, this is the case when the respective session is over.
  </p>   
  <p>
     Log files which contain personal data are generally deleted after seven days at the latest, unless
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>In case of error logs which allow us to fix errors in the game, the data will be deleted after 30 days; or</li>
      <li>In case of a breach of the terms of service, the data will be stored for up 2 years, or for the entire duration of the Legal Dispute, whichever occurs later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution is pending.
  </p>
  <h4>5. Possibility of objection and removal</h4>
  <p>
     The collection of data for the purpose of making the website or mobile app available and the storage of the data in log files are essential for the operation of the website. As a consequence, there is no objection possibility on the part of the user. Likewise, in case of error logs and breach of terms of service, there is no possibility of requesting the objection or the deletion of the log files. This decision is based on Art. 21(1) and 17(3)(f) GDPR.
  </p>

  <h4>6. Existence of automated decision making</h4>

  <p>
     InnoGames uses an automated tool to determine whether you are breaching our Terms of Services or Game Rules in regards to the usage of prohibited bots and scripts (“Bot Detection Tool”). The Bot Detection Tool serves us by analyzing the data produced by your hardware when playing our games. In case the Bot Detection Tool determines that your actions in the game are incompatible with the action produced by a human, you might be subject to receiving an automatic ban.
  </p>

  <h3>B) Game Forums</h3>

  <h4>1. Description and scope of data processing</h4>
  <p>
     Apart from the games themselves, InnoGames offers you the opportunity to participate in the game forums. To use the forums, it is necessary to create an account using your game account and provide a username and password. The following data is processed within the context of the forums:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Username</li>
      <li>Password</li>
      <li>Avatar picture</li>
      <li>Date of registration</li>
      <li>User-generated content in forum posts and forum signatures</li>
      <li>Email address or an alias email address associated with the game, market, and Player ID</li>
  </ul>
  <p> 
     Note that the alias email address is automatically created by InnoGames and is not visible to others.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Purpose of data processing</h4>
  <p>
     The collection of these data serves the purpose of providing you with the service, identification towards other users, and identification of the player for the purpose of moderation, account personalization, and management.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, your personal information will be shared if it is necessary to protect other users or to counter threats to state or public security or to prosecute criminal offences and if is permitted by statutory data protection provisions. Your protectable interests will be considered in accordance with the statutory provisions. Please note that InnoGames may be obliged to disclose data due to statutory provisions or, for instance, a judicial order (e.g., disclosure to investigative authorities). Disclosure always occurs only insofar as it is necessary and legally permitted or prescribed.
  </p>
  <h4>3. Legal basis for data processing </h4>
  <p>
  The legal basis for the processing of user generated content is our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. InnoGames has a legitimate interest in preserving all individual player contributions in the forums. Each contribution offers valuable insights about the game and the community. Deleting parts of these comments not only renders the forums unreadable but also erases historical information that can assist other players in reaching their game goals.
  </p>
  <p>
  In cases where InnoGames is legally obliged to disclose data, the legal basis for the processing is substantiated in Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. 
  </p>
  <h4>4. Storage duration of data </h4>
  <p>
  The deletion of your game account automatically leads to the deletion of your forum account. However, the deletion of your forum account does not lead to the deletion of user-generated content in the forum.
  </p>

		Since our games are generally free to download and play, to be able to maintain and continuously develop our games we monetize them by displaying ads in them. When displaying ads, we use third-party advertising companies to serve the ads in our games. The advertising companies pay us for displaying their ads and this what makes it possible for us to offer you the game free of charge. Apart from this, we might also give you the possibility to watch an ad instead of paying for a feature that you otherwise would have to pay. The third-party advertising companies may collect and use some of your personal information, including but not limited to IP address, geo location, and language settings to offer you personalized ads, but also to know if you clicked on and watched the video ad. Non-personally identifiable information to manage and measure the delivery of advertising within that game can be collected, including the number of times the same advertisement is served and viewed.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>
    <p>
    	The data is processed by us to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We offer our mobile games for free, so these ads allow us to continue making and updating top quality free games which is a legitimate interest of ours but also of yours if you want to play games for free. Without displaying ads, we would not make sufficient money to keep offering the games for free to you. Please do not play our games if you do not wish to have your personal data processed for advertising purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Legal basis for data processing</h3>
   	<h4>a) iOS and browser</h4>
    <p>
    	Personalized Ads: The legal basis for processing your personal data (especially your IDFA) for personalized ads on iOS is your consent, Art. 6(1)(a)GDPR, which you grant us by allowing tracking through the pop-up at the start of the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	You can revoke your consent with effect for the future as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
    		iOS: Select “Ask App Not to Track” in the consent pop-up at the start of the game (if you haven’t already disabled tracking in your system settings). If you want to withdraw your consent later: Open “Settings” > “Privacy & Security” > “Tracking”. On this screen you can control if and how apps can track you across other companies’ apps and websites. Additionally, open “Settings” > “Privacy” Security” > “Apple Advertising”. On this screen you can control if and how Apple shows you personalized ads.
    </p>
    <p>
    		Browser: Deselect “Allow third party browser cookies and pixels” in the Data Usage Window of the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Non-Personalized Ads: The legal basis for processing your personal data to display ads that are not personalized is a legitimate interest of ours, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We offer our games for free. To be able to keep doing this we show advertisements in our games for which the advertising companies pay us. Without this, we would have to charge a fee for you to play our games. It is a legitimate interest of ours to process your data to display ads that are not personalized to be able to keep providing you our games free of charge and so we remain able to compete with other companies on the market and create great and entertaining games that a large audience can enjoy, no matter how much money one is able to spend. This interest outweighs a potential contrary interest of yours if you do not want your data to be processed to display ads. Unfortunately, it is technically not possible to efficiently display ads without processing some of your personal data for this purpose. Please do not play our games if you do not wish to have your personal data processed for us to display non-personalized ads.
    </p>
    <h4>b) Android and Fire OS</h4>
    <p>
    	Personalized and Non-Personalized Ads: The legal basis for processing your personal data to display personalized ads as well as ads that are not personalized is a legitimate interest of ours, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). We offer our games for free. To be able to keep doing this we show advertisements in our games for which the advertising companies pay us. Without this, we would have to charge a fee for you to play our games. It is a legitimate interest of ours to process your data to display ads that are not personalized to be able to keep providing you our games free of charge and so we remain able to compete with other companies on the market and create great and entertaining games that a large audience can enjoy, no matter how much money one is able to spend. 
    </p>
    <p> You can opt-out of having your personal data processed for personalized ads as follows:</p>
    <p>		Android: Open “Settings” > “Privacy” > “Ads”. On this screen you can control if and how ad personalization on the device occurs.</p>
    <p>		Fire OS: Open “Settings” > “Security & Privacy” > “Advertising ID” > “Interest-Based Ads”. On this screen you can control if and how ad personalization on the device occurs.</p>
	
    <p>
   		Opting out of having your personal data processed when we display non-personalized ads is unfortunately not possible. In case of non-personalized ads, our legitimate interest to process data to display such ads (see above) outweighs a potential contrary interest of yours. Unfortunately, it is technically not possible to efficiently display ads without processing some of your personal data for this purpose. Please do not play our games if you do not wish to have your personal data processed for us to display non-personalized ads.
    </p>
   <h3>4. Storage duration of data</h3>
    <p>
   	 The data will be retained as long as you maintain your account with us. Note that by playing as a guest, that is, even if you have not registered and confirmed your e-mail with us, you still maintain an account with us (“Guest Account”). Additionally, your account will be deleted after 3 years of inactivity, or earlier if you actively request its deletion as described in Section 20.
