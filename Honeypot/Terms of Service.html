Functioning of the Service / Honeypot’s responsibilities</h4><ol><li><p>Honeypot provides the Service to connect Talent and Companies. The Service works as follows: Talent sign-up to the Service and make a profile available. Companies provide a profile after concluding the Recruiting Partnership Agreement. This profile is only visible to Talents that the Companies are interested in as defined below. Companies can browse the Talent profiles in a list and detailed view and decide to apply to the respective Talent by sending an interview request through the detailed view. These interview requests come with a first, non-binding offer proposal of what compensation package the company has in mind. Talent can review the interview requests and are now able to browse the profiles of Companies that have sent the requests. The Talent can accept or reject the interview request. If rejected, the Company may (upon choice of the Talent) recontact the Talent with a revised proposal. If accepted, Honeypot connects Talent and Company.</p></li><li><p>Once a Talent has been viewed by a Company in the detailed view it is introduced by Honeypot (“Introduction”). If Talent and Company had been introduced in the past twelve months before the Introduction directly or by a third party and Company does not inform Honeypot about this within five business days in writing and substantive materials showing the introduction, the Talent is considered to have been introduced by Honeypot. Email or the Service are sufficient media in this matter. A Talent is considered to be already introduced directly or by a third party when there is a written communication concerning the Talent, with a clear identification of the Talent and the Company and with a clear identification of the opportunity to hire the Talent.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot may from time to time, but is under no obligation to, suggest a specific Talent to a Company or vice versa. The Talent is then also seen as introduced. This can be done via email, messaging service or phone.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot undertakes reasonable efforts to match Talent and Companies, however, Honeypot does under no circumstances represent, assume a warranty or guarantee or undertake in any other way that Talent or Company will find a match through Honeypot and/or the Service.</p></li></ol><h4>4. Obligations of Company</h4><ol><li><p>Company shall submit the information about the Company as requested in the compulsory and voluntary fields of the sign-up form or as requested via email by Honeypot.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot may add compulsory or voluntary fields from time to time. Honeypot may also request additional information from Company on a case-by-case basis. The Company shall not transmit any personal data (i.e,. data allowing identification of an individual) to Honeypot, unless data protection laws allow for such transmission or Company has obtained consent from the concerned parties.</p></li><li><p>Unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, Honeypot will usually communicate with the Company via email. The Company shall make sure that it receives all emails sent by Honeypot to the address submitted in the course of the application, or at a later date. The Company will in particular configure the spam filter accordingly and regularly check all incoming email under this address. Honeypot may choose any other appropriate means of communication.</p></li><li><p>The Company shall keep all access data (login, passwords etc.) for the Service (“Access Data”) strictly confidential. The Company shall promptly inform Honeypot in case it learns or suspects that an unauthorized third person is in possession of the Access Data.</p></li><li><p>In case Honeypot has reason to believe that an unauthorized third party is in possession of Access Data, Honeypot may, without assuming any responsibility to do so, and always acting in its sole discretion, change the Access Data without prior notice or block the respective account. Honeypot will promptly inform the Company and will, upon request, communicate the new Access Data to the Company without undue delay. The Company cannot claim to have its initial Access Data restored.</p></li><li><p>In case a third party uses Access Data, with the Company at fault, the Company’s Access Data, the Company is liable for all such actions, and for damages. In such event, all access through the Company’s Access Data shall be considered as an access by the Company.</p></li><li><p>During the term of the Agreement, the Company will not induce, or assist in the inducement of, any employee of Honeypot or any of its affiliates to leave their employment with Honeypot or any of its affiliates. This shall apply to the extent permissible under Sec. 75 of the German Commercial Code.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot is not responsible for providing or assisting with the obtaining of any work or other permits and/or medicals and other country specific regulations and requirements that may be necessary to employ the Talent unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot is relying on the information provided by the Talent. Company has the obligation to satisfy itself, that the Talent is suitable for the intended job and fits Company&#x27;s requirements.</p></li></ol><h4>5. Payment</h4><ol><li><p>Fees for the entire subscription period stated in the Agreement are immediately payable in advance at the time the invoice is issued.</p></li><li><p>Honeypot reserves the right to change the fee from time to time, to be effective as of the following period of renewal. Honeypot shall notify the Company in writing or email of any fee change sixty days prior to the Company’s renewal period. In the event of a price increase, the Company&#x27;s entitled to submit to Honeypot within 4 weeks of the date of Honeypot’s notification a written declaration of withdrawal from the agreement with retroactive effect from the date of the renewal.</p></li><li><p>Non-use of Honeypot services including Hiring Credits, during the contract period does not entitle the Company to claim a reimbursement, price reduction or extension of term beyond the respective contract period.</p></li><li><p>The Company cannot make a claim for reimbursement of advance payments in the following cases: a. If Honeypot terminates the agreement with cause, b. If Honeypot imposes one or more of the sanctions in accordance with Section 2., c. If the Company terminates the agreement.</p></li><li><p>The Company’s claim for reimbursement of advance payments is not excluded if the Company terminates the agreement for cause arising from Honeypot’s area of responsibility.</p></li><li><p>The Company can opt to enter into a new subscription if all Hiring Credits are used during an ongoing contractual period, this purchase requires a separate contract. Placements without available Hiring Credits within the same contractual period shall be subject to a commission fee as outlined in Section 6.3. below.</p></li></ol><h4>6. Placement of Talents</h4><ol><li><p>Company undertakes to inform Honeypot in writing (through the service or via email is sufficient) as soon as possible, but no later than the number of days specified in the Recruiting Partnership Agreement if an introduced Talent is hired or otherwise contracted by Company (“Placement”). The notification shall include a copy of the original employment contract which must include the start date, the date the contract was signed and information about the Salary as defined in Section 6.3 below. Honeypot may contact Company to request status updates about ongoing negotiations.</p></li><li><p>Placement shall mean any form of employment, temporary employment, contracting or other use of Talent by Company or an undertaking affiliated with Company in the sense of Sec. 15ff. of the German Stock Company Act.</p></li><li><p>When a Talent is placed pursuant to Section 6.2 during the period of an Introduction and is not included in the Hiring Credits of the Recruiting Partnership Agreement, Honeypot will receive a commission as specified in the Recruiting Partnership Agreement, of the Talents salary (“Salary”). Salary shall include the gross base salary or fees, bonus (guaranteed and/or anticipated), commissions, allowances, inducement payments, shift allowances, location weighting and call-out allowances, and all other compensation the Talent receives or is anticipated to receive during the first year of his placement. Excluded is compensation paid by Company to Talent to compensate expenditures (e.g. travel, relocation, visa application) as well as any equity, share options or similar compensation options. To clarify: bonuses based on company performance are not excluded. Company undertakes to inform Honeypot about the Salary upon notifying Honeypot about the placement.</p></li><li><p>If the Placement is for less than twelve months, Honeypot’s commission will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. Subsequent hires, prolongations, extensions or similar will be added to the pro-rata calculation until the level as defined in Section 6.3 is reached. This is done for a period of up to twenty-four months from the initial placement. Company must notify Honeypot pursuant to Section 6.1..</p></li><li><p>Company is entitled to get a replacement Hiring Credit if the Placement is terminated. A placement is defined as terminated if the termination notice is signed and in effect within the time specified in the Recruiting Partnership Agreement. The replacement Hiring Credit is subject to the conditions set forth in the Recruiting Partnership Agreement and can be used within six (6) months from the date of employment termination of the Talent within the actual contractual term of the Recruiting Partnership Agreement.</p></li></ol><h4>7. Non Circumvention</h4><ol><li><p>Company explicitly agrees to withhold completely from entering a relation with or from approaching Talent either directly or through third parties, especially recruiters with regard to the Placement of introduced Talent during the contractual period and 12 months after the termination of the contract.</p></li><li><p>Any direct or indirect business relations between Company and Talent or recruiters with regard to the above-named services and respective Talent have to either involve Honeypot as intermediary or require Honeypot’s prior written consent.</p></li><li><p>Company is personally responsible to follow this commitment and must not use any means to circumvent its obligation.</p></li><li><p>Breach of this clause will result in a contractual penalty to be determined by Honeypot’s exercise of its reasonable discretion, subject to review by an independent court in Honeypot’s residential country and should not be less than five times the financial loss caused through this unauthorized action with a minimum fee of 25,000 EUR.</p></li><li><p>An obligation to reimburse damages will thereby not be excluded.</p></li><li><p>In case Company can prove having entered into a business relationship with recruiters or Talent in regards to the respective Talent before the Introduction of the Talent through the Service, this Section 7 shall not be enforced.</p></li></ol><h4>8.
