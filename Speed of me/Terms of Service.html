                <p>
                    Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a
                    recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on
                    the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
                    cancel it or SPEED OF ME, LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account
                    management page or by contacting SPEED OF ME, LLC customer support team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You
                    shall provide SPEED OF ME, LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip
                    code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
                    automatically authorize SPEED OF ME, LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such
                    payment instruments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SPEED OF ME, LLC will issue an electronic invoice indicating that
                    you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as
                    indicated on the invoice.

                <p>
                    If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by SPEED OF ME, LLC
                    until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you canceled your Subscription, you
                    will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
                </p>
