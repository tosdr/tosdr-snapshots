We do not store your Payment Information and do not control and are not responsible for the Payment Processors or their collection or use of your information. You may find out more about how the Payment Processors store and use your Payment Information by accessing the Payment Processors privacy policy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to use PayPal to make purchases through the Sites or receive payment through our Bug Bounty program, you will be directed to the PayPal website and provide your payment information directly to PayPal.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Characteristics of a protected class, such as your gender or relationship status if you have this information on your public profile.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We will only use personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use personal information for the following lawful purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (“<strong>performance of a contract</strong>”).</li>
<li>Where we receive your consent (“<strong>consent</strong>”).</li>

<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“<strong>legal obligation</strong>”).</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We will only use personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that we may process personal information about you without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>PERSONAL DATA RETENTION</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We retain personal information in identifiable form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the personal information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements and similar essential purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information about you, the purposes for which we process personal information about you and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other Similar Technologies</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Defiant web pages may use other technologies such as web beacons to help deliver cookies on our Sites and count users who have visited those Sites.

This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you purchase, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (referred to as “Retargeting”). We collect information about where you saw the ads we serve you and what ads you clicked on to measure the success of our advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Defiant, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>

<p>You must be at least the age of majority in your place of residence to use the Sites or Services. The Sites or Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. Consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we learn that we received any information directly from a child under age 13 without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform the child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot use the Sites or Services.</p>
<p>California Minors: While the Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: privacy@defiant.com. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the Content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>YOUR STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">State consumer privacy laws may provide their residents with additional rights regarding our use of personal information. The following Section applies to individuals who reside in specific jurisdictions that provide additional privacy rights, including <strong>California and Virginia.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Your Rights and Choices</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability Right. </em>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
<li>If we disclosed personal information for a business purpose, the business purpose for which personal information was disclosed, and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Right to Correct Information. </em>You have the right to request we update personal information about you that is incorrect in our systems.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Right to Delete. </em>You have the right to request that we delete any personal information about you that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) the personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Right to Opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising</em>We do not sell personal information of share personal information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Information Use. </em>You have the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information regarding you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Non-Discrimination. </em>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To submit a request to exercise these rights you may use one of these two methods:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">E-mailing it to us at: privacy@defiant.com</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mailing it to us at: Defiant Inc. Attn: Privacy Policy Issues, 1700 Westlake Ave N Ste 200, Seattle, WA 98109</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For submissions via email please use the downloadable <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Defiant-Verifiable-Consumer-Request-Form.pdf"><u>Verifiable Consumer Request Form</u></a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your Privacy Rights,” indicate which type of request you are making, and provide your name, street address, city, state, zip code and an e-mail address or phone number where we may contact you. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly or that do not include complete information.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To appeal a decision regarding a consumer rights request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Only you, or a person registered with the an applicable Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to personal information about you. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide the personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><strong>THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you reside within the European Union or the United Kingdom you may be entitled to other rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. We may require you to verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your rights. If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these rights with respect to personal information about you that we collect and store:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time (please note that this might prevent you from using certain aspects of the Portal, the Services, or the Portal or Services altogether);</li>
<li>the right to access personal information about you;</li>
<li>the right to request a copy of personal information about you;</li>
<li>the right to correct any inaccuracies in personal information about you;</li>
<li>the right to erase personal information about you;</li>
<li>the right to data portability, meaning to request a transfer of personal information about you from us to any other person or entity as chosen by you;</li>
<li>the right to request restriction of the processing of personal information about you; and</li>
<li>the right to object to processing of personal information about you.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may exercise these rights free of charge. These rights will be exercisable subject to limitations as provided for by the GDPR. Any requests to exercise the above listed rights may be made to: privacy@defiant.com.</p>
<p>If you reside within the European Union or United Kingdom, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority about how we process personal information at the following websites: for EU residents, <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a> ; for UK residents, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/</a>.</p>
<p><em>International Transfers of Personal Data</em></p>
<p>Whenever we transfer personal information out of the EU or UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/standard-contractual-clauses/">European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses</a>: We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the EU.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/uk-international-data-transfer-addendum/">UK Information Commissioner’s Office International Data Transfer Agreement or International Data Transfer Addendum</a> (where applicable)</li>
</ul>
