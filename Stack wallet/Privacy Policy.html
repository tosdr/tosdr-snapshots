<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Stack Wallet LLC ("Stack Wallet", "Company", or "We") policy is to respect and protect the privacy of the users of our App. We collect only minimal information and data to understand our customers and tailor our services to better serve them.</p>

<p>This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the App (our "App") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>

<p>This policy applies to information we collect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On this App.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and this App.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It does not apply to information collected by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Us offline or through any other means, including on any other App operated by Company or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries)]; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the App.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you have the choice to not use the App. By accessing or using this App, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this App after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>"App" means any software program provided by the Company, downloaded by You on any electronic device, including but not limited to Stack Wallet.</p>

<p>"Device" means any device that can access the App, such as a cell phone or tablet device.</p>

<p>"Node" means a server on a supported cryptocurrency network which transmits data to your App for processing and synchronization, and to which your Device transmits transactions which you would like to submit to the supported cryptocurrency networks. This includes full nodes, Electrum servers and EpicPost.</p>

<p>"Stack Wallet Nodes" refers to the set of cryptocurrency Nodes operated and maintained by Stack Wallet LLC.</p>

<p>"Service" refers to the App.</p>

<p>"Third-party Service" refers to any service integrated into the App. This includes but is not limited to ChangeNOW.</p>

<p>“Usage Data" refers to data collected automatically about your usage of an App.</p>

<p>"You" means the individual, group, corporation, or any other entity accessing or using the Service.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-never-receive-nor-collect">Information We Never Receive Nor Collect</h2>

<p>Usage Data (including the date and time at which you use an application, the duration of using it, and other ‘metadata’) is NOT collected by Stack Wallet through the usage of the App. Stack Wallet has no reason to care about any aspect of your continued usage of our App. We believe that this data is your own property and that we have no right to collect it.</p>

<p>Data relating to your funds, and their security and privacy, remains on your device at ALL times. Your private keys and their associated view keys, seeds, backup files, and wallet passcode are your own responsibility. This data is not received, collected, or stored by Stack Wallet at any time, for any reason.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-may-receive-but-do-not-retain-or-retain-temporarily">Information We May Receive But Do Not Retain or Retain Temporarily</h2>

<p>We receive but do NOT store information from and about users of our App, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The block height to which your wallet is synchronized, and any transactions or channels which you use our Node to submit to supported cryptocurrency networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>We receive this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically as you use the App.</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is provided by connecting to the Nodes and price API maintained by Stack Wallet. You have the right to choose not to provide synchronization data to Stack Wallet by choosing a different Node. We provide a list of Nodes in the app that include our own and third party Nodes, or you can use your own Node (which we recommend).</p>

<p>Personal Data sent through the Stack Wallet Nodes is limited to your device's IP address, the block height to which your wallet is synchronized, and any transactions or channels which you use our Node to submit to the supported cryptocurrency networks. Personal Data received by Stack Wallet in this manner is not stored for any length of time, and thus Stack Wallet is both unwilling to and incapable of sharing this data, or using it for any purpose beyond ensuring your appropriate connection to our Nodes.</p>

<p>If you decide to use a Node offered by any third party, some of which we include in our Apps, said third party will receive this Personal Data instead of Stack Wallet. We take no responsibility for the actions of any third-party Node offered within the Application. We recommend connecting to your own Node to limit third party sharing of your Personal Information.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-may-receive-and-retain-temporarily">Information We May Receive and Retain Temporarily</h2>

<p>We receive but only store information temporarily for the following:</p>

<p>We maintain default server logs from our servers for 3 days so that we can detect error and crashes and any failures. These logs may contain your device IP’s address, but these aren’t linked to your activity on Stack Wallet’s Nodes. Logs that are older than 3 days are purged daily and are not retained.</p>

<p>We receive this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically as you use the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="information-we-may-receive-and-retain">Information We May Receive and Retain</h2>

<p>We maintain default logs on Stack Wallet Nodes for 3 days so that we can detect errors, crashes and any failures. Logs that are older than 3 days are purged daily and are not retained.</p>

<p>These logs may contain your device IP’s address. Your device IP’s address is compared against a locally hosted geolocation database to identify its country of origin and then purged immediately so that your device IP address is not logged, only aggregated data sorted by country. We use this information to understand where our customers are from and to improve localization and marketing efforts. We do not share this information with any third parties.</p>

<p>We receive this information:</p>

<ul>

                    <p>Stack Wallet was put together because, despite many wallet options existing, none of them quite met the criteria we wanted for a crypto wallet. Some were open source, but had a terrible user experience, others were single coin only, and still others had good design, but the source code was closed, leading to very high trust involved.</p>
                    <p>Most wallets were some combination of the above, but never all of them at once. Enter Stack Wallet, the first multicoin, open-source wallet, that sticks to its ideals, and looks good doing it.</p>
