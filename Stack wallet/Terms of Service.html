<p><strong>6.2.</strong>  The nature of crypto assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.

All decisions based on information contained on the Application are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Application.</p>

<p><strong>6.5.</strong>  Any reference to a type of crypto asset on the Application does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the crypto asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of crypto asset.</p>

<p><strong>6.6.</strong>  Transactions entered into in connection with the Application are irreversible, final and not subject to refunds. Accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Application at your own risk, and accept all consequences of using the Application, including the risk that you may lose access to your crypto assets indefinitely.

WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h2 id="10--limitation-of-liability">10.  <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></h2>

<p><strong>10.2.</strong>  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM OF FIFTY US DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT.</p>

<p><strong>10.3.</strong>  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h2 id="11--dispute-resolution--arbitration">11.  <strong>Dispute Resolution &amp; Arbitration</strong></h2>

<p><strong>11.1</strong>.  Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Stack Wallet and affects your rights. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.</p>

<p>(a)  <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) between Stack Wallet and any user that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Stack Wallet, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>

<p>(b)  <strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("<strong>Notice</strong>") describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in these Terms will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. After the Notice is received, you and Stack Wallet may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Stack Wallet do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>

<p>(c)  <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("<strong>ADR Provider</strong>") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ("<strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>") governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>

<p>(d)  <strong>Time Limits</strong>. If you or Stack Wallet pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>

<p>(e)  <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Stack Wallet, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Stack Wallet.</p>

<p>(f)  <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT ANY LITIGATION SHOULD ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND STACK WALLET IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN A SUIT TO VACATE OR ENFORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR OTHERWISE, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT THE DISPUTE BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE.</p>

<p>(g)  <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</strong>.

<p>(h)  <strong>Confidentiality</strong>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>

<p>(i)  <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p>(j) <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>(k) <strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Stack Wallet.</p>

<p>(l) <strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Stack Wallet may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>

<p>(m) <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>(n) <strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration</strong>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

<p>(o) <strong>Courts.</strong> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of New Mexico, for such purpose.</p>

<p><strong>13.5.</strong>  We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Application, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.</p>

                    <p>Stack Wallet was put together because, despite many wallet options existing, none of them quite met the criteria we wanted for a crypto wallet. Some were open source, but had a terrible user experience, others were single coin only, and still others had good design, but the source code was closed, leading to very high trust involved.</p>
                    <p>Most wallets were some combination of the above, but never all of them at once. Enter Stack Wallet, the first multicoin, open-source wallet, that sticks to its ideals, and looks good doing it.</p>
