Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.</p><p style="text-align: start">Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by a third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private.

Depending on the service you choose, we may collect the following types of information:</p><h4 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>1.1.1 Information you provide to us</strong></h4><p style=\"text-align: start\">We may collect any personal information you provide to us, which is necessary for the service you choose.

In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable law.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security. When you send or receive data from your Xiaomi device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) and other algorithms.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">All your personal information is stored on secure servers and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection supervisory authority and data subjects.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>4.2 What you can do</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You can set a unique password for Xiaomi by not disclosing your sign-in password or account information to anybody (unless such person is duly authorized by you) to avoid password leaks to other websites which may harm your account security at Xiaomi. Whenever possible, please do not disclose the verification code you received to anyone (including those who claim to be Xiaomi customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by a third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>4.3 Retention policy</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding service. An exception to this is personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes. Xiaomi will continue to retain this type of information for longer than its standard retention period, where permitted based on applicable laws or your request, even if further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5 Your rights</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Controlling your personal information</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.1 Controlling settings</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Xiaomi recognizes that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways Xiaomi makes available to you to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of your personal information and control your privacy settings, such as sign in or out of the Mi Account.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for the aforementioned purposes, you may change your mind at any time by contacting us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a></p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.2 Your rights to your personal information</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Depending on applicable laws and regulations, you have the right to access, rectification, and erasure of any other personal information that we hold about you (hereinafter referred to as the request).</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You may also access and update the details relating to the personal information in your Mi Account at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://account.xiaomi.com\">https://account.xiaomi.com</a> or by logging into your account on your device. For additional information, please write to us or contact us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">This Privacy Policy requires that your request satisfy applicable laws and regulations and the following conditions:</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><em>(1) Through Xiaomi's particular request submission channels listed below, and your request should be in writing (unless the local law explicitly recognizes the oral request), for the protection of your information security;</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><em>(2) Provide sufficient information to enable Xiaomi to verify your identity and ensure that you are the subject of the requested information or a personal legally authorized to act on the subject’s behalf.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Once we obtain sufficient information to confirm that your request can be processed, we shall proceed to respond to your request within any timeframe set out under your applicable data protection laws.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">In detail:</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal information and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this Privacy Policy.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• Based on the requirements of applicable laws, a copy of your personal data collected and processed by us will be provided to you upon your request free of charge. For any extra requests for relevant information, we may charge a reasonable fee based on actual administrative costs according to the applicable laws.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• If any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, you are entitled to have your personal information corrected or completed.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• Based on the requirements of applicable laws, you have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. We shall consider the grounds regarding your erasure request and take reasonable steps, including technical measures. <strong>If the right is upheld, we may not be able to immediately remove the information from the backup system due to applicable law and/or technology limitations. If this is the case, we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until the backup can be cleared or be made anonymous.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• You have the right to object to certain types of processing, and under certain circumstances where the legal basis for processing is our legitimate interests.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Particularly under the laws of some jurisdictions:</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• You have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing your personal information. We shall consider the grounds regarding your restriction request. If the grounds apply to GDPR, we shall only process your personal information under applicable circumstances in GDPR and inform you before the restriction of processing is lifted.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">• You have the right to apply for your personal information in a structured, commonly used format and transmit the information to another data controller.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We have the right to refuse to process requests that are frivolous requests that damage others' right of privacy, extremely unrealistic requests, requests that require disproportionate technical work, and requests not required under local law, information that have been made public, information given under confidential conditions. If we believe that certain aspects of the request to delete or access the information may result in our inability to legally use the information for the aforementioned anti-fraud and security purposes, it may also be rejected.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.3 Withdrawal of consent</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You may withdraw your consent previously provided to us for a particular purpose by submitting a request, including collecting, using, and/or disclosing your personal information in our possession or control. Based on the specific service you are using, you can visit the Mi Account management center at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://account.xiaomi.com/pass/del\">https://account.xiaomi.com/pass/del</a> or contact us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>. We will process your request within a reasonable time from when the request was made, and thereafter not collect, use and/or disclose your personal information as per your request.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Depending on the extent of your withdrawal of consent, please note that you may not be able to continue receiving the full benefit of Xiaomi’s products and services. The withdrawal of your consent or authorization will not affect the validity of our processing carried out on the basis of the consent up until the point of withdrawal.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.4 Cancelling a service or account</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you wish to cancel a specific product or service, you can contact us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a> for logout service.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you wish to cancel the Mi Account, please note that the cancellation will prevent you from using the full range of Xiaomi products and services. Cancellation may be prevented or delayed in certain circumstances.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>6 How your personal information is transferred globally</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Xiaomi processes and backs up personal information through a global operating and control infrastructure. Currently, Xiaomi has data centers in the United States, Germany and Singapore. For the purposes described in the Privacy Policy, your information may be transferred to these data centers in accordance with applicable law.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We may also transfer your personal information to third-party service providers and business partners and your data may therefore also be transmitted to other countries or regions. The jurisdiction in which these global facilities are located may or may not protect personal information to the same standards as in your jurisdiction. There are different risks under different data protection laws. However, this does not change our commitment to comply with this Privacy Policy and to protect your personal information.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If we need to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliates or third-party service providers, we will comply with related applicable laws. We ensure that all such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection laws by implementing uniform safeguards. You can find out about the safeguards that we have in place by contacting us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you use our services in the area of the European Economic Area (EEA), Xiaomi Technology Netherlands B.V. will act as the data controller and Xiaomi Singapore Pte. Ltd. will be responsible for the data processing. Contact details can be found in the \"Contact us\" section.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If Xiaomi shares personal data originating by you in the EEA to a Xiaomi Group entity or a third party service provider outside the EEA, we will do so on the basis of EU standard contractual clauses or any other safeguards provided for in the GDPR.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>7 Protection of minors</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">We consider it the responsibility of the parent or guardian to supervise the child's use of our services. However, we do not offer services directly to a child or use personal data of children for the purposes of marketing.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that the minor has provided Xiaomi with personal information, please contact us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a> to ensure that the personal information is removed immediately and that the minor is unsubscribed from any of the applicable Xiaomi services.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>8 Do i have to agree to any third party terms and conditions?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by a third party. Depending on the service you use, it may incorporate a third parties’ products or services. Some of these will be provided in the form of links to third parties’ websites.
