    </ol>

    <h2 id="BoardRules">Message Board Rules &amp; Conditions</h2>
    <p>To help keep British Comedy Guide's message board friendly and usable, we have a number of additional rules to follow in addition to the general BCG Account rules. Please be aware we may opt to enforce the below rules with zero-tolerance. The violation of these rules could result in the offending user(s) being temporarily suspended or permanently banned from the website. Any and all restrictions and other judgments are made at the discretion of the message board moderators and administrators.</p>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The word of a moderator, when acting in his or her capacity as a staff member, is to be considered 'gospel' and cannot be disputed with the moderator privately or publicly, or with the community as a whole. Should the decision of the moderator be considered particularly unjust, the user should <a href="https://www.comedy.co.uk/contact/other/">contact BCG's Editors</a>, whose decision will be final.</li>
        <li>Be aware moderators or administrators may edit, remove, or otherwise modify any data on the message board without warning. This includes, but is not restricted to, threads, individual posts, user profiles, and entire user accounts.</li>
        <li>You should be aware that anything you post can be found by Google and other services, and associated with your nickname. If your nickname is your real name do be careful in this regard about what you reveal.</li>
        <li>The delete and edit post functionalities are time-limited. After a specified time period, to protect the integrity of the thread, you will not be able to remove or modify your post.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Posting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Unless said in legitimate context (for example, a proper noun), &quot;txt spk&quot; is strictly forbidden.</li>
        <li>As far as is possible, correct English spelling and grammar should be used at all times.</li>
        <li>Members should refrain from SHOUTING UNNECESSARILY in their posts.</li>
        <li>Posting simply to increase a user's post count is not permitted.</li>
        <li>Before creating a thread, users should make use of the forum search functionality in order to ensure that a relevant thread does not already exist for their intended topic of discussion.</li>
        <li>Off-topic - that is, deviation from a thread's topic - material and discussion is forbidden in a number of forums. These forums can be identified by a warning/reminder message above post submission fields.</li>
        <li>If a user has a complaint regarding another user's conduct, suspects them of holding multiple user accounts, or wishes to raise any other concern or point regarding another user, these should be conveyed to a moderator or the Editor privately (for example, by private message). Such matters aired publicly (i.e. in threads) will be considered trolling and dealt with accordingly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Post Content</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Contributions must be civil and tasteful. Users may not post information relating to or otherwise post content in any form concerning the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Activities illegal in the United Kingdom or other locales</li>
                <li>Religious material (except where in legitimate discussion of a programme)</li>

This includes referral/affiliate links, links to sites for which the poster will directly financially benefit, advertising for a free resource, sending an unsolicited private message offering a product or service, or otherwise posting simply for financial or membership benefits. Permission will often be given, provided the advert will be of interest to message board users (i.e. comedy related), but it must be sought.</li>
        <li>Users must post their questions or comments in one thread in one forum, not multiple threads in one forum or multiple threads in multiple forums. That is, users must not make &quot;double posts&quot; by which they post in multiple forums with the same message or question.</li>
        <li>Unless he/she has a legitimate reason (the definition of &quot;legitimate&quot; is at the discretion of the moderators), users should not post within their own thread simply for the sake of making that thread appear at the top of the forum, commonly referred to as &quot;bumping&quot;.</li>
        <li>Please clearly label all spoilers (in this case, a spoiler is revealing detail about plot developments that have not been broadcast in the UK yet) so that users can avoid if they so wish.</li>
