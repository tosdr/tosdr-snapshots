<h1>Privacy Report<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-report" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>We hold personal data about vendors, administrators, clients and other
individuals for a variety of purposes.
This policy sets out how we seek to protect personal data and ensure that
administrators understand the rules governing their use of personal data to
which they have access in the course of their work.
In particular, this policy requires that the Data Protection Officer (DPO) be
consulted before any significant new data processing activity is initiated to
ensure that relevant compliance steps are addressed.</p>
<section id="scope">
<h2>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This policy applies to all users who have access to any of the personally
identifiable data.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-is-responsible-for-this-policy">
<h2>Who is responsible for this policy?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-responsible-for-this-policy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the Data Protection Officer, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:richard&#37;&#52;&#48;hughsie&#46;com">Richard Hughes</a>.
has overall responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of this policy.
The DPO is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the
United Kingdom as a registered data controller.</p>
</section>
<section id="fair-and-lawful-processing">
<h2>Fair and lawful processing<a class="headerlink" href="#fair-and-lawful-processing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We must process personal data fairly and lawfully in accordance with individuals’ rights.
This generally means that we should not process personal data unless the
individual whose details we are processing has consented to this happening,
or where such collection is unavoidable and/or considered pragmatic in the
context, e.g. logging the number of downloads of a particular file.</p>
<p>We do not consider an IP address to represent a single user (due to NAT or VPN use),
and as such metadata requests are not considered personal data using the draft GDPR guidelines.</p>
</section>
<section id="accuracy-and-relevance">
<h2>Accuracy and relevance<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy-and-relevance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will ensure that any personal data we process is accurate, adequate,
relevant and not excessive, given the purpose for which it was obtained.
We will not process personal data obtained for one purpose for any unconnected
purpose unless the individual concerned has agreed to this or would otherwise
reasonably expect this.
Individuals may ask that we correct inaccurate personal data relating to them.
If you believe that information is inaccurate you should inform the DPO.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-personal-data">
<h2>Your personal data<a class="headerlink" href="#your-personal-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data we hold about
hardware vendors is accurate and updated as required.
For example, if your personal circumstances change, please update them using
the profile pages or inform the Data Protection Officer.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-security">
<h2>Data security<a class="headerlink" href="#data-security" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We keep personal data secure against loss or misuse.
Where other organizations process personal data as a service on our behalf,
the DPO will establish what, if any, additional specific data security
arrangements need to be implemented in contracts with those third party
organizations.</p>
<section id="storing-data-securely">
<h3>Storing data securely<a class="headerlink" href="#storing-data-securely" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>All data is stored electronically.
All documents and code are held on a locked LUKS partition with a password
adhering to security best practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-retention">
<h3>Data retention<a class="headerlink" href="#data-retention" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We must retain personal data for no longer than is necessary.
What is necessary will depend on the circumstances of each case, taking into
account the reasons that the personal data was obtained, but should be
determined in a manner consistent with our data retention guidelines.
Anonymized user data (e.g. metadata requests) will be kept for a maximum of
5 years which allows us to project future service requirements and provide
usage graphs to the vendor.</p>
</section>
<section id="transferring-data-internationally">
<h3>Transferring data internationally<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-data-internationally" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are restrictions on international transfers of personal data.
We do not transfer personal data anywhere outside the EU without the approval
of the Data Protection Officer, unless required to do so by law.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="subject-access-requests">
<h2>Subject Access Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#subject-access-requests" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please note that under the Data Protection Act 1998, individuals are entitled,
subject to certain exceptions, to request access to information held about them.</p>
<p>On receiving a subject access request, we will refer that request immediately
to the DPO. We may ask you to help us comply with those requests.
Please also contact the Data Protection Officer if you would like to correct
or request information that we hold about you.
There are also restrictions on the information to which you are entitled under
applicable law.</p>
</section>
<section id="processing-data">
<h2>Processing data<a class="headerlink" href="#processing-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>

</section>
<section id="data-portability">
<h2>Data portability<a class="headerlink" href="#data-portability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Upon request, a data subject should have the right to receive a copy of their
data in a structured format, typically an SQL export.
These requests should be processed within one month, provided there is no
undue burden and it does not compromise the privacy of other individuals.
A data subject may also request that their data is transferred directly to
another system. This is available for free.</p>
</section>
<section id="right-to-be-forgotten">
<h2>Right to be forgotten<a class="headerlink" href="#right-to-be-forgotten" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A vendor may request that any information held on them is deleted or removed,
and any third parties who process or use that data must also comply with the request.
An erasure request can only be refused if an exemption applies.</p>
</section>
<section id="privacy-by-design-and-default">
<h2>Privacy by design and default<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-by-design-and-default" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Privacy by design is an approach to projects that promote privacy and data
protection compliance from the start.
The DPO will be responsible for conducting Privacy Impact Assessments and
ensuring that all changes commence with a privacy plan.
When relevant, and when it does not have a negative impact on the data subject,
privacy settings will be set to the most private by default.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-audit-and-register">
<h2>Data audit and register<a class="headerlink" href="#data-audit-and-register" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
