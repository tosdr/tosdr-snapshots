All such Policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If these Terms are inconsistent with any Policy, the Terms will control.</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time, and that any such changes will be effective immediately when we post the modified Terms. Your continued access and use of the Pawshake Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.</p><p class="mt-sm">Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of Pawshake is described in our Privacy Policy.</p><p class="mt-sm">These Terms and Conditions are organized into the following sections:</p><ol class="ml-xl list-decimal"><li>Key terms</li><li>Nature of Our Site and Services</li><li>Eligibility</li><li>Use of Site and Compliance</li><li>User Content and Communication Rules and Guidelines</li><li>Your User Content and Photos</li><li>Bookings and Financial Terms</li><li>Cancellations and Refunds</li><li>Links to Third-Party Websites</li><li>Disclaimers of Warranties</li><li>Limitation of Liability and Release</li><li>Indemnification</li><li>Termination and Account Cancellation</li><li>Intellectual Property Rights</li><li>Employment and Withholding</li><li>No Agency</li><li>Governing Law</li><li>Severability</li><li>Miscellaneous</li></ol><p class="mt-sm"><b>1.

Nature of our Site and Services</b></p><p class="mt-sm">The Pawshake Service is an online platform designed to help Pet Owners (&quot;Members&quot;) find, communicate with and interact with providers of pet-related services (&quot;Hosts&quot;).</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake is a neutral venue for Hosts and Members. We are not involved in the transactions between Users. Users arrange for the services solely between themselves, and Pawshake is not a party to any of those arrangements. Pawshake does not provide pet care services. Pawshake is not a referral, matching or placement service and does not provide, refer, place, offer or seek to obtain employment or engagements for any of its Users. You understand and agree that Pawshake is not a party to any agreements entered between the users, nor is Pawshake a broker, agent or insurer.</p><p class="mt-sm">Notwithstanding the above, Pawshake offers a payment policy to safeguard the payments between Members and Hosts.</p><p class="mt-sm">While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Pawshake has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content, or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party.</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being &quot;verified&quot; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Pawshake about any Member, including of the Member&#x27;s identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable.</p><p class="mt-sm">We conduct a review of Hosts profiles when they sign up and we may facilitate background checks on Hosts conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the Pawshake Terms, we do not otherwise screen Hosts and Members. </p><p class="mt-sm">As a result, Pawshake has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of Profiles, Reviews, background check information, affiliations or other User Content submitted on the Site, and makes no representations about any such User Content on the Site. Pawshake does not have control, supervise or provide equipment to the Hosts, and has no control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the services provided by Hosts.</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake further makes no representations about the Users. You should make your own assessments of the persons you decide to interact with, engage or provide services to. Pawshake has no control over the conduct of users of the site and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the Pawshake Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet&#x27;s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone&#x27;s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.</p><p class="mt-sm">While certain Hosts may receive positive assessments or comments by the Site or its users, Pawshake makes no representations or warranties regarding the quality, security or positive features of the Host or the Host&#x27;s residence.</p><p class="mt-sm">Because we are not involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behaviour of Users, Users must resolve any issues, disputes or concerns directly with each other. You agree to release Pawshake from any claims or liability that may arise from any disputes between you and other Users. As a Member, you acknowledge and agree that the entire risk arising out of your use of the Site, including listing and booking Host-Provided Services, is entirely your own. You acknowledge and agree that Pawshake is not liable for any damages associated with the administration of pet boarding or other Host-Provided Services, which may include but are not limited to, bodily injury or death to your pet (whether caused by the Host, any family member, friend, pet or other affiliate of the Host or any other third party).</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake is not party to any agreement or transaction between Member and Hosts and, as such, cannot verify or otherwise authenticate any claims made by the Host (including any medical certifications or insurance coverage held by a Member). Moreover, it is incumbent upon you to share any and all relevant information, including but not limited to medical issues, allergies or other conditions, about your pet prior to engaging the Host for pet boarding or other pet-care related services.</p><p class="mt-sm">We may provide suggested or optional default terms for transactions between Members and Hosts, or otherwise between users. To the extent we do, and you or another user utilizes or agrees to such terms, this does not make us a party to the transaction between Members, Hosts, or other users of the Site. Any suggested or default terms we provide are for users&#x27; convenience only and do not constitute legal or other advice. Nor do they constitute any sort of guarantee or warranty regarding the Services, or the accuracy of any information implied by, or compliance with the terms or the proposed transaction. You should review all terms carefully and seek your own advice or counsel with respect to the meaning or consequences of any terms.</p><p class="mt-sm">Some Host-Provided Services (e.g.: pet boarding) are not appropriate for all pets, especially aggressive poorly socialized pets. You acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility, as a Member, to determine if the applicable Host-Provided Service is best for your pet and to select the Host carefully.</p><p class="mt-sm">If a Member fails to retrieve their pet within three (3) days after the service period identified in a Booking (or an earlier period required under applicable animal abandonment or cruelty laws) agree that Pawshake (or the Host) may, in its sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, shelter and notify the authorities. As a Member you agree that you will be responsible for and will reimburse Pawshake all costs and expenses of any such action, and you acknowledge that you may become subject to any applicable laws that may govern your failure to retrieve your pet, including all applicable animal abandonment or cruelty laws.</p><p class="mt-sm">Furthermore, Pawshake expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Member&#x27;s pet from a Host&#x27;s care should Pawshake deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Host, or any persons living with the Host. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Host, Pawshake will use reasonable efforts to contact the Member and/or the Member&#x27;s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care. Should Pawshake not be able to contact the Member or the emergency contact, Pawshake will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Member is able to retrieve his/her pet. If you are a Member, you authorize your pet&#x27;s veterinarian(s) to release your pet&#x27;s veterinary records to Pawshake in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Pawshake or the Host in connection with such transfer, including any additional charges for new Bookings.</p><p class="mt-sm">We recommend that Members give their Host contact information where they can be reached in the event of emergency (for example when medical care for a pet becomes necessary). The Host agrees to immediately contact the Member in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Member is not available, to contact Pawshake support. If you are a Member, you hereby authorize your Host and Pawshake to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorise care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorise your pet&#x27;s veterinarian(s) to release your pet&#x27;s veterinary records to Pawshake. If your Host reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you release the Host and Pawshake for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care, including from reimbursement that may otherwise have been available under the Pawshake&#x27;s Premium Protection program. Members are solely responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Member, you hereby authorize Pawshake to charge you for such costs. In certain circumstances, a Member may be eligible for reimbursement under the Pawshake&#x27;s Premium Protection Program.</p><p class="mt-sm">As a matter of goodwill, however, and to protect the interests our community we have developed programs to assist in disputes or claims between Users, both of which are subject to specific conditions: (i) the Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee, and (ii) Pawshake&#x27;s Premium Protection, free of charge, for eligible bookings.</p><p class="mt-sm">As a Host, you acknowledge and agree that neither Pawshake nor a Member have any responsibility to reimburse or otherwise cover you for any property damage that may be caused by a Member pet, and you hereby agree not to seek any such reimbursement or other damages from Pawshake or a Member or guest pet&#x27;s owner(s) in the event of any such property damage, in each case except as provided in the Pawshake&#x27;s Premium Protection Program.</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake may also offer Members and Hosts phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care. These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the Pawshake Service. If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care. You agree to resort solely to the applicable third party consultation service in the event of any claims arising from their services.</p><p class="mt-sm">Users provide Pawshake with their mobile phone number as part of the registration process or in their account settings. Users who provide Pawshake with their mobile phone number may receive text message communications from Pawshake on their cellular phones and/or mobile devices. By providing Pawshake with your mobile phone number, you consent to Pawshake sending text messages to your cellular phone and/or mobile device. Pawshake does not charge for sending text messages, but your carrier may charge you.</p><p class="mt-sm">Users of Pawshake&#x27;s mobile applications may have the option to receive push notification alerts from Pawshake. If push notification alerts are available, you will be given an option to consent to receiving them after you download the application. You may also adjust your push notification settings after you have downloaded the application in your mobile device settings.</p><p class="mt-sm">The Site may include certain services that are available via a mobile device (collectively, the &quot;Mobile Services&quot;). To the extent you access the Site through a mobile device, your wireless service carrier&#x27;s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.</p><p class="mt-sm">Due to the nature of the Internet, Pawshake cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the Pawshake Platform. Pawshake may restrict the availability of the Pawshake Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Pawshake Platform. Pawshake may improve, enhance and modify the Pawshake Platform and introduce new Pawshake Services from time to time.</p><p class="mt-sm"><b>3.

However, we reserve the right to conduct such checks and/or to verify your account and registration information and the representations and warranties you have made, which may include, without limitation, our using third party service providers to conduct criminal background checks or identity verification checks or to perform other background or verification services, and, using available public records, including information available on online social networks and other online sources, each to the extent permitted by law.</p><p class="mt-sm">User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any User&#x27;s identity.

As a Host, you may set the pricing and terms for your services within the parameters permitted by the Site. Please note that it is the Host and not Pawshake which determines the Hosting Fees.</p><p class="mt-sm">Each Host hereby appoints Pawshake as the Host&#x27;s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Members on behalf of the Host. Each Host agrees that payment made by a Member to Pawshake shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the Host-Provided Services available to Member in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the applicable fees.</p><p class="mt-sm">In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Pawshake assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host. As a host, you contractually agree that the first and all future bookings with a client from Pawshake will be booked via the Site. Failure to abide by this policy may result in suspension from the Site.</p><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake charges a Service Fee of 19% to the Host to cover the costs of payment processing, marketing and site administration. Pawshake may also charge a fee (including a booking fee and/or trust and safety fee) that will be presented to the Member during the booking process.</p><p class="mt-sm">Please note that Pawshake does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Pawshake reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings.</p><p class="mt-sm">As a Member, you may book Host-Provided Services through the Site.</p><p class="mt-sm">In connection with the Member-requested booking, the Member will be asked to provide customary billing information such as for example name, billing address and credit card information either to Pawshake or its third-party payment processor. The Member agrees to pay Pawshake for any confirmed bookings made in connection with their Pawshake Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site – e.g. by PayPal or credit card. The Member hereby authorises the collection of such amounts by charging the payment method provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Pawshake or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. If the Member is directed to Pawshake&#x27;s third-party payment processor, the Member may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party&#x27;s service and that third party&#x27;s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.</p><p class="mt-sm">The Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Pawshake at its sole discretion) or the Member will have no obligation to complete the transaction.</p><p class="mt-sm">If the Host accepts the booking request (i.e. the booking is completed by both parties), they agree to honour the price set forth in their Booking and the full amount of the Host-Provided Service, inclusive of the Pawshake Service Fee will be charged to the Member&#x27;s payment information on file immediately.</p><p class="mt-sm">The Member authorises to be charged in the event of</p><ul class="ml-xl list-disc"><li>For Flea Situations involving a Member&#x27;s Pet. Members acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any situation arises where the Member&#x27;s Pet introduces fleas into a Host&#x27;s home, the Member&#x27;s payment information may be billed for any amount to reimburse costs incurred attendant thereto. These costs may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with treating a Host&#x27;s resident animals and/or home for fleas or flea prevention. It is the responsibility of all Members to disclose any knowledge of flea issues associated with their pets to all Hosts before any Service is rendered.</li><li>For Emergency Medical Situations Involving a Member&#x27;s Pet. Members should ensure that the Host is provided with contact information to reach the Member in the event an emergency medical situation arises involving a Member&#x27;s Pet. Members and Hosts acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any situation arises where the Member&#x27;s Pet is required to receive emergency veterinary care while in the care or custody of the Host, the Host shall make reasonable efforts to contact the Member and notify him or her of the situation. In the event the Host notifies Pawshake of the situation, the Host should contact Pawshake and Pawshake shall make reasonable efforts during Pawshake&#x27;s normal business hours to contact the Member to notify them of the situation. If Member cannot be reached following reasonable efforts, Member authorises Host and Pawshake to authorise care on his/her behalf in order to promptly treat Member&#x27;s Pet. Members acknowledge and agree that the costs of any such treatment for emergency medical situations is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Member and that Member&#x27;s credit card may be billed for any amount to reimburse costs incurred by the Host or Pawshake attendant thereto.</li><li>If you are a Member, you acknowledge and agree that, if you fail to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking, you will be charged for additional service time (pro rata for each partial late day) at the daily rate established in the Booking. In addition, you agree to indemnify Pawshake from, and agree that we may charge you for any additional costs and expenses Pawshake or the Host incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.</li></ul><p class="mt-sm">Pawshake will release the payment (less Service Fee) to the Host within seven (7) business days after the end of the services. Once these amounts have been disbursed, any further payment disputes are between the Member and Host, and Pawshake has no obligation to mediate or facilitate any resolution. Further, Pawshake has no responsibility or liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the Pawshake Service.</p><p class="mt-sm">If you are a Host, Pawshake reserves the right to issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you pursuant if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reason involving protection of Pawshake, the Pawshake community or third party rights. We may also recommend that third-party payment service providers restrict your access to funds in your account under the same circumstances. </p><p class="mt-sm"><b>8. Cancellations and Refunds</b></p><p class="mt-sm">Cancellation by Members: Each Host agrees that Pawshake may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, permit the Member to cancel the booking.</p><p class="mt-sm">Hosts can choose one of the following cancellation policies, which is displayed on their profile:</p><ul class="ml-xl list-disc"><li>Flexible: A Member gets a full refund if they cancel the booking by 12h00 noon one day before the service begins (12h00 noon is determined by Host&#x27;s time zone). If a Member cancels after 12h00 noon the day before the stay begins, they&#x27;ll get a 50% refund for the cancelled days.</li><li>Moderate: A Member gets a full refund if they cancel the booking by 12h00 noon one week (7days) before the service begins (12:00 noon is determined by your sitter&#x27;s time zone). If a Member cancels after 12h00 noon one week before the stay begins, they&#x27;ll get a 50% refund for the cancelled days.</li></ul><p class="mt-sm">Dog walking and Doggy Day care always have a Flexible cancellation policy.</p><p class="mt-sm">Home visits, home boarding and housesitting can have a Flexible or Moderate cancellation policy. The moderate cancellation policy is the default cancellation policy for home visits, home boarding and housesitting.</p><p class="mt-sm">If you as a Member wish to cancel a booking, once it has been paid for contact our customer support team, so we can process the cancellation and relevant refund.</p><p class="mt-sm">Cancellations by Hosts are taken seriously and may result in account review, temporary suspension and possibly termination of their access to Pawshake. Sitters are expected to only accept those Bookings that they are committed to completing. Pawshake understands the need for exemptions when extenuating circumstances arise. Examples of that include but are not limited to the death of a direct relative, natural disaster, or some other catastrophic event that makes you unable to provide the service.</p><p class="mt-sm">Booking Guarantee. Pawshake uses all reasonable efforts to find replacement Hosts when the Host cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking. The availability of the Booking Guarantee depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Host-Provided Service booked. Generally, if the Booking Guarantee applies and a Member accepts a new Booking with a replacement Host, Pawshake will (with the limited exceptions described below) pay the cost difference between the original Booking and the new Booking, up to but not exceeding 25% of the total cost of the original Booking. Pawshake shall do the utmost to assist the Member in finding alternative Hosts but shall not be liable for any consequential losses arising out of the Member not being able to secure an alternative. However, if a Booking is cancelled by a Host due to the Member&#x27;s failure to provide accurate or complete information regarding the pet or due to the pet&#x27;s aggressive behaviour, the Member is responsible for the full cost of any new reservation.</p><p class="mt-sm">We recommend for first-time booking between Member and Host, Member and Host may, at their own discretion, arrange for a live &quot;Meet &amp; Greet&quot; to introduce the Member&#x27;s pet to Host, the Hosts home and pets. If the result of this meeting is the determination that a pet boarding stay or other Host-Provided Service would not be in the best interests of the pets, either party may cancel the booking and all money will be refunded to the Member. The Member must contact Pawshake&#x27;s customer support to request this refund.</p><p class="mt-sm">Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee: If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Host has failed to provide services as agreed with the Member or otherwise in accordance with these Terms then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Member. The refund is not to exceed five (5) days of the gross booking amount.</p><p class="mt-sm"><b>9.

You expressly release and discharge Pawshake from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action whatsoever arising out of any damage, loss, personal injury or death to you and/or your children/child/ward, while the pet is boarding in your home or you otherwise provide any Host-Provided Services.</p><p class="mt-sm">Whether you are a Member or a Host, you agree not to hold Pawshake or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or third-party providers liable for any damage, suits, claims, and/or controversies (collectively, &quot;liabilities&quot;) that have arisen or may arise, whether known or unknown, relating to your use of or inability to use the services or site, including without limitation any liabilities arising in connection with (a) any instruction, advice, act or service provided by Pawshake or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or third party providers, (b) any destruction of your user content, (c) any dispute with any other user of the site, (d) Hosts&#x27; failure to provide services or provision of incomplete or poor services, (e) any injuries or harm suffered by you or any third party (including without limitation your family members, friends or other unrelated parties), (f) any injuries or harm suffered by any pets or other pets, (g) any damage or harm to real or personal property, or (h) any other conduct, act or omission of any other party, including without limitation stalking, harassment that is sexual or otherwise, acts of physical violence, or destruction of property.</p><p class="mt-sm">Under no circumstances shall Pawshake or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or third party providers be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from your use or inability to use this site or the host-provided services, including your reliance on any information obtained from this site that results in mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion or corruption of files, viruses, delays in operating or transmissions, or any failure of performance. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply in any action, whether in contract, tort or any other claim, even if an authorised representative of Pawshake has been advised of or should have knowledge of the possibility of such damages. By your use of this site, you acknowledge that this paragraph shall apply to all content, goods and services available through this site, except where the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages is prohibited by law. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the foregoing limitations may not apply to you. If, notwithstanding the foregoing exclusions, it is determined that Pawshake or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or third party providers are liable for damages, in no event will the aggregate liability, whether arising in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, exceed one hundred US dollars ($100.00), excluding any obligations to pay amounts to hosts or refunds to members pursuant to these terms.</p><p class="mt-sm">No Liability for non-Pawshake Actions. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Pawshake be liable for any damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, general, special, compensatory, and/or consequential, arising out of or relating to the conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the Pawshake service, including without limitations, bodily injury, emotional distress, and/or any other damages resulting from reliance on information or consent posted on or transmitted through the Pawshake service, or for any interactions with other users of the Pawshake service, whether online or offline. This includes any claims, losses or damages arising from the conduct of users who attempt to defraud or harm you.</p><p class="mt-sm">You agree that the limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p><p class="mt-sm">You also expressly acknowledge and agree that Pawshake has set its prices and entered into these Terms in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between you and Pawshake and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.</p><p class="mt-sm"><b>12. Indemnification</b></p><p class="mt-sm">You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pawshake and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and Third Party Providers (collectively, the &quot;Indemnified Parties&quot;) against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys&#x27; fees and costs) incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with a claim by a third party related to you or your use of the Site or Host-Provided Services.

Sitters are expected to only accept those Bookings that they are committed to completing. Pawshake understands the need for exemptions when extenuating circumstances arise. Examples of that include but are not limited to the death of a direct relative, natural disaster, or some other catastrophic event that makes you unable to provide the service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBooking Guarantee. Pawshake uses all reasonable efforts to find replacement Hosts when the Host cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking. The availability of the Booking Guarantee depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Host-Provided Service booked. Generally, if the Booking Guarantee applies and a Member accepts a new Booking with a replacement Host, Pawshake will (with the limited exceptions described below) pay the cost difference between the original Booking and the new Booking, up to but not exceeding 25% of the total cost of the original Booking. Pawshake shall do the utmost to assist the Member in finding alternative Hosts but shall not be liable for any consequential losses arising out of the Member not being able to secure an alternative. However, if a Booking is cancelled by a Host due to the Member's failure to provide accurate or complete information regarding the pet or due to the pet's aggressive behaviour, the Member is responsible for the full cost of any new reservation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe recommend for first-time booking between Member and Host, Member and Host may, at their own discretion, arrange for a live \"Meet \u0026 Greet\" to introduce the Member's pet to Host, the Hosts home and pets. If the result of this meeting is the determination that a pet boarding stay or other Host-Provided Service would not be in the best interests of the pets, either party may cancel the booking and all money will be refunded to the Member. The Member must contact Pawshake's customer support to request this refund.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSatisfaction Money Back Guarantee: If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Host has failed to provide services as agreed with the Member or otherwise in accordance with these Terms then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Member. The refund is not to exceed five (5) days of the gross booking amount.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e9.
