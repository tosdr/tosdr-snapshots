        <p>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of  
            who are California residents to request certain information regarding ’s disclosure of

        <p>Many browsers including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome contain a “do not track” optional setting. 
           In general, when a “do not track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies websites that the user does not 
           want the user’s personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities tracked over 
           time and across different Web sites or online services. Websites are not required to honor a do not track request 
           and as required by amendments to the California Shine the Light law, we are informing you that we do not honor such 
           requests.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Arbitration Agreement</span>.</p>

            you do any of the following things after an opportunity to review this agreement: give us a written or electronic signature; 
            tell us orally or electronically that you accept; submit information to us on our website. This Agreement affects your legal 
            rights and remedies and provides that disputes between you and  Revenue (the “Company”), must be resolved through binding 
            arbitration rather than in a court.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Resolution Of Claims or Disputes</span>.</p>
        <p> hopes to make you a happy customer and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the 
            customer's satisfaction by email our customer service department. If, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, 
            this Agreement describes how both of us will proceed. Any claim or dispute between you and  (or any of Company’s 
            subsidiaries or affiliates) arising out of or relating in any way to the product or this Agreement shall be resolved through 
            final, binding arbitration. This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach 
            of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included 
            are all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of our relationship; claims that may arise after the termination of 
            this Agreement; and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, 
            emails, and telemarketing calls.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Limitation of Legal Remedies</span>.</p>
        <p>We each agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or 
            representative proceeding. All arbitrations under this Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) 
            basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement 
            specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration 
            proceedings brought by any other person.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Arbitration Procedures</span>.</p>
        <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis 
            of the claim or dispute and setting forth the specific relief sought. All Notices to  shall be sent to the following address: 
             , , ,  . Upon receipt of such Notice, the other party shall have a thirty-day 
            period in which it may satisfy the claim against it by fully curing the dispute and/or providing all the relief requested in the 
            Notice. After the expiration of such thirty-day cure period, you or  may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration 
            of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) United 
            States Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures 
            are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its web site at www.adr.org. The arbitration of any claim or dispute under this 
            Agreement shall be conducted in the State of New York or in the location in which you received this Agreement or in your home state. 
            For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $25,000,  will pay all costs of the arbitration and will agree to conduct the 
            arbitration through the AAA offices in your home state. For any claim under $10,000,  further agrees that any hearings may 
            be held by telephone and that  will not seek attorney’s fees in the event  prevails. You 
            acknowledge and agree that each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Choice of Law</span>.</p>
        <p>This Agreement concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Severability</span>.</p>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent 
            that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions shall remain fully enforceable.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</span></p>
        <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calling us at </li>
            <li>By writing us at: , , ,  </li>
            <li>Visiting <a href="https://docs.britebox.io/ccparequest.aspx">https://docs.britebox.io/ccparequest.aspx</a> to fill out a request form.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer 
            request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

        <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
            <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and 
            confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will 
            only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Response Timing and Format</span></p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you 
            of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not 
            have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover 
            the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with 
            a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and 
            should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we 
            determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

        <p>If we deny your request, you may have the right to appeal our decision. We will respond to appeals from Virginia and Connecticut residents within 60 days. 
            We will respond to appeals from Colorado residents within 45 days.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionTitle">Non-Discrimination</span></p>
