                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_59"><b>Personal Data We Collect Directly From You.</b> You may provide us with the information described in the Table in Section 14 directly when you engage with the Services, such as signing up for an account online, through an application, or interact with a Listener Care agent. We also may collect personal data directly from you when you choose to provide to it, such as when you respond to a survey or when you conduct a transaction, such as purchasing merchandise from a Sirius XM store.</p>

                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_60"><u>Profiles.</u> When you set up a profile for listening use on a Sirius XM Service, you provide us with personal data and agree that such personal data and any listening and service usage information associated to your profile may be collected and processed to support the profile features. We do not use profile personal data for advertising or share profile personal data with third parties other than service providers. With your consent, we may add your profile data to your subscription account when you subscribe to a Sirius XM Service. The data on your subscription account will become subject to the full range of terms of this Policy. You must be 16 years or older to have a profile for a SiriusXM audio Service.</p>
                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_61"><u>Real Time Chat.</u> The SiriusXM Service may offer you a Customer Support Chat, which will record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of assisting you during the conversation, provide related support for your account, subscription, or services, to improve our products and services, and for marketing purposes. During a Customer Support Chat, you may interact with a generative artificial intelligence.

If you do not consent to such recording, use and retention, please do not use the chat assistance feature.</p>
                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_62"><u>Photos and Audio.</u> We may allow you to post photos or audio files to the Services or we may collect photos or audio from another interaction you have with us, such as your call interaction with a Listener Care agent, your call-in to a show or host, or your participation at a Sirius XM or Pandora live event. We do not process your photos or audio to create a record of facial geometry or use as them as a means for facial or voice recognition, facial surveillance, or in any other way as a biometric identifier. We collect your voice command when interacting with the Services, in order to execute the request and for analysis for product improvement. Your voice command is not used to identify you individually and is not retained in association with you or your subscription. Audio that we collect from you may be shared with a third party service provider for transcription.  </p>
                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_63">Please note that to the extent that you post your photos or audio publicly onto community spaces on the Services, they will be public.  In addition, when you post or share photos, videos or audio on social media or other third party platforms, we do not control the actions of those third parties, and their use of such media will be governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

                        <p class="Static__body__text" id="translation_64"><b>Personal Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties.</b> We may receive information about you from service providers, third parties with whom we have a business relationship (such as vehicle manufacturers, dealers, vehicle repair companies, sponsors, or licensors), retailers, content distribution platforms, advertising networks and agencies, advertising technology companies, marketing companies, data providers who enhance the information we have about you, sources of publicly available information, governmental or quasi-governmental agencies or organizations, and other users of the Services (such as community users, when users provide your information to gift you one of our products, or share content with you, or “refer a friend” or similar programs that we may offer).
