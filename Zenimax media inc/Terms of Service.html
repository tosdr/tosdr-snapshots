        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="legal terms-of-service">
            <h1><center><strong>ZENIMAX MEDIA TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></center></h1>
<p>These Terms of Service contain a binding individual arbitration and class action waiver agreement in Section 15 (Dispute Resolution, Binding Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver) that requires You and ZeniMax to resolve Disputes in binding individual arbitration, and not in court before a judge or jury, if You live in the United States or most other countries. Arbitration is not required if You live in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Norway (collectively, the &quot;<strong>EEA</strong>&quot;), Switzerland, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, or Turkey. You may opt out of the binding individual arbitration and class action waiver within 30 days after You first accept these Terms of Service. See Section 15(B).</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (together with Supplemental Terms, defined below, &quot;<strong>Terms of Service</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Agreement</strong>&quot;) govern Your access to and Your purchase, receipt, and use of video games and other Services (defined in Section 1 below) that are provided or made available by ZeniMax Media Inc., on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries (collectively, &quot;<strong>ZeniMax</strong>&quot;).</p>
<p>By purchasing, accessing, receiving, or using any Services, You agree to these Terms of Service and represent and affirm that You are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where You live) OR You have reviewed these Terms of Service with Your parent or guardian and he or she assents to them on Your behalf and takes full responsibility for Your compliance with them. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, You and the minor agree to these Terms of Service and are responsible for all use of the Services, including purchases, whether the minor's Account or Memberships are open now or created later.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>You</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Your</strong>&quot; mean you and, if you are a minor, also your parent or guardian.</p>
<p>In addition to these Terms of Service, any additional terms and/or agreements that apply to the particular Service(s) accessed, played, purchased, received, or used by You, govern Your access to, purchase, receipt, play, and use of Services (collectively, &quot;<strong>Supplemental Terms</strong>&quot;). The Supplemental Terms form part of these Terms of Service and are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. Examples of Supplemental Terms include, but are not limited to, the code of conduct for a ZeniMax Game (defined in Section 1 below), ZeniMax issued contest rules, ZeniMax issued tournament rules and related tournament agreements, beta agreements for pre-release versions of Games, and nondisclosure agreements. These Terms of Service may also be supplemented by any End User License Agreement (the &quot;<strong>EULA</strong>&quot;) accompanying a ZeniMax Game or other terms and conditions that are applicable to a specific Game. The EULA and/or such other terms and conditions govern Your access to and Your purchase, receipt, play, and use of the Game. In addition, the ZeniMax Media Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.zenimax.com/legal_privacy"><strong>www.zenimax.com/legal_privacy</strong></a>, sets forth how ZeniMax and its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 5 below) collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process Your personal information related to the Services or ZeniMax's websites.</p>
<p>ZeniMax may change these Terms of Service at any time by posting the revised version at <a href="https://www.zenimax.com/legal_terms"><strong>www.zenimax.com/legal_terms</strong></a>. We will notify You when we do. By continuing to access, use, play, purchase, or receive the Services or our websites after the changes become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Service. If You do not agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Service, You must stop accessing, using, playing, purchasing or receiving the Services and, if you are a parent or guardian, help Your minor children close their Accounts, memberships, and subscriptions. Memberships and subscriptions are referred to collectively as &quot;<strong>Memberships</strong>&quot;.</p>

<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_01">1. Services; Your Account(s); Photosensitivity and Virtual Reality Warnings</a></h3>
<p>ZeniMax offers a range of products and services on PC, Mac, consoles, and mobile devices, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) games and other products or services that You download, install, or play online as a service (sometimes referred to as &quot;games as a service&quot; or &quot;GaaS&quot;), including, but not limited to, ZeniMax's computer, mobile, and console entertainment software game(s) (collectively, &quot;<strong>Game(s)</strong>&quot;), (ii) access to Content (defined in Section 2), including, but not limited to, digital goods (such as wallpaper and character outfits), in-Game consumables, Game Mods, Downloadable Content (as defined below) and other digital items, (iii) software, including, but not limited to, third-party software and small amounts of code that might be necessary to facilitate playing online Games that are provided by ZeniMax as a service offering (collectively, &quot;<strong>Software</strong>&quot;), and (iv) related services, such as Membership programs that include special benefits for members, downloading and uploading media, forums, and additional features (together with Content, Games and Software collectively referred to as &quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;). For purposes of these Terms of Service, references to a &quot;Game&quot; include, unless the context requires otherwise, Content that is accessible by or used or available in the Game or that is applicable to the Game and the Software that facilitates the playing of the Game. You must provide at Your own expense the PC, Mac, console, mobile device, other equipment, Internet connections, and wireless service plans to access, receive, play, and use the Services. ZeniMax does not warrant, represent, or guarantee that a Service will be accessible or useable on all equipment or with all wireless or Internet service plans.</p>
<p>Certain Services may require the creation of an account (&quot;<strong>Account(s)</strong>&quot;). To create an Account, You must have a valid email address and be eligible to use the Service for which You are registering. You must provide truthful and accurate information, and update such information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. During the registration process You may be required to create a password. ZeniMax has the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate Your Account and refuse any and all current or future access to or receipt, purchase, play, or use of Services if ZeniMax reasonably believes that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.</p>
<p>Some Services may require creation of a user name, such as a &quot;UserID&quot;, &quot;Display Name&quot;, &quot;Character Name&quot; or &quot;Guild Name&quot; to represent You in the Services, and which are tied to Your Account (collectively, &quot;<strong>user name(s)</strong>&quot;). You may not select the name of another person, any third party's trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property, any name that could mislead other players to believe You to be an employee of ZeniMax or affiliated companies, or any name that ZeniMax deems in its sole discretion to be vulgar, offensive, or otherwise violates these Terms of Service. Subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined below), ZeniMax reserves the right, in its sole discretion, (a) to delete or alter any user names tied to an Account; and (b) to restrict, suspend, or terminate Your access to or play or use of any Service or license granted to You, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any suspected or actual infringement of any trademark or trade name right, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right.</p>
<p>By creating an Account, You agree that You do not own the Account, any user names created on the Account, any Content stored or associated with an Account (such as digital and/or virtual assets, achievements, virtual currency, and other Downloadable Content), or related data associated with the Account.</p>
<p>Accounts are non-transferable under all circumstances. You have sole liability for all activities on Your Account and/or under Your user names. You may be held liable for losses incurred by ZeniMax or other third parties due to someone else using Your Account, user name and/or password. Your Account or certain features of Your Account may be restricted, suspended, and/or terminated if someone else uses Your Account, user name, and/or password to engage in activity that violates these Terms of Service or is otherwise improper or illegal. You agree to promptly notify ZeniMax if You suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of Your Account, user name, password, or personal information, or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to request and/or require You to alter Your password if we believe that Your password is no longer secure.</p>
<p>Do not reveal Your Account password to others. ZeniMax employees will not ask You to reveal Your password. You provide Your password only during automatic Account Services, such as during the log-in process, or if You initiate a &quot;Forgot Password&quot; request to obtain security questions to receive a new password.</p>
<p>ZeniMax takes certain steps to protect against possible breaches of our Services and the personal information we maintain about You. However, no online service, website, or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, ZeniMax cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly encourage You to proactively take responsibility for the security of Your personal information, user credentials, and accounts by (i) selecting a highly secure and unique password, maintaining its confidentiality, and periodically updating it, (ii) consistently logging out of Your Account and closing the application upon concluding your use of our Services, and (iii) leveraging multifactor authentication whenever it is made available by ZeniMax.</p>
<p>SECTION 12 OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO COLLECT DAMAGES FROM ZENIMAX IF (I) YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ZENIMAX AND (II) YOU LIVE IN A JURISDICTION WHERE PROVISIONS EXCLUDING OR LIMITING LIABILITY ARE ENFORCEABLE.</p>
<p>IF YOU LIVE IN THE EEA, UK, SWITZERLAND, RUSSIA, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, TURKEY, JAPAN, OR BRAZIL, ZENIMAX ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN GUARANTEES, WARRANTIES, TERMS, AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IN RESPECT OF REFUNDS AND RETURNS, UNFAIR TERMS AND ZENIMAX'S MANDATORY LEGAL DUTIES (SEE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH) AND LIABILITY SUCH AS FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO ITS NEGLIGENCE) IMPOSED BY THE LAWS RELATING TO THE SUPPLY OF GOODS, SERVICES, AND DIGITAL CONTENT UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, AND ANY EULA WHICH THE LAWS EXPRESSLY PROVIDE MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED, OR MODIFIED, OR MAY ONLY BE LIMITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT (THE &quot;<strong>STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS</strong>&quot;).</p>
<p>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, AND ANY EULA EXCLUDES, RESTRICTS, OR MODIFIES THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OTHERWISE THAN ACCORDING TO SUCH LAWS.</p>
<p>UNDER THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS ZENIMAX IS UNDER A LEGAL DUTY TO SUPPLY TO YOU GOODS, SERVICES, AND DIGITAL CONTENT THAT ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU AND TO DO SO USING REASONABLE SKILL AND CARE.</p>
<p><em><strong>PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING</strong></em>. A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain visual images, including without limitation light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer, television, or other screen, or while playing video games, may induce epileptic seizures or blackouts in these individuals. These conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms, blackouts, or seizures in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If You, anyone in Your family, or anyone in Your household, have an epileptic condition, have had seizures of any kind, or seizure symptoms, consult a doctor prior to using the Services or playing any Game. If You experience any of the following symptoms while playing any Game, <strong>immediately discontinue use and consult Your physician before resuming play</strong>: dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, loss of awareness, disorientation, confusion, any involuntary movement, or convulsions.</p>
<p><em><strong>VIRTUAL REALITY WARNING</strong></em>. If a Game provides for virtual reality gameplay and/or the use of third-party virtual reality headsets and/or related equipment, certain health and safety precautions and disclaimers apply. Failing to review and adhere to the health and safety precautions set forth in these Terms of Service, in the Game's End User License Agreement, and the precautions given by the manufacturer of Your virtual reality headset or related equipment may cause damage to property, personal injury to You or others, or death. <strong>Immediately stop playing if You feel unwell or experience any of the following symptoms</strong>: epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness; altered vision; motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation or nausea; and/or repetitive motion injuries and eye strain. Always be aware of Your surroundings when playing with a virtual reality headset. If You are pregnant or if You have any pre-existing medical condition, You should talk with a physician to obtain professional advice before playing a virtual reality Game. <strong>Carefully read and follow all health and safety precautions from Your virtual reality headset manufacturer before use</strong>. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), IN NO EVENT SHALL ZENIMAX BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY, OR DEATH (OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR MISUSE OF A VIRTUAL REALITY GAME OR ANY VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET OR RELATED EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE OR OBJECTS IN OR AROUND THE PLAY AREA DURING GAMEPLAY. YOU HEREBY RELEASE ZENIMAX, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET, RELATED EQUIPMENT, OR THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>Any utilization, replication, alteration, or dissemination of our Services, encompassing, though not confined to, Games, Content, Software, or any other intellectual property, without explicit authorization either under these Terms of Service or through written consent from an authorized representative of ZeniMax, is strictly forbidden. Not all features, products, or Services offered or provided are available to all persons who try to register or in all geographic locations. ZeniMax reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product, or Service to any person or geographic area.</p>
<p>Any offer for any feature, product or Service is void where such Services are prohibited. You are solely responsible for Your compliance with applicable laws with respect to the Services that You access, purchase, receive, play, or use.</p>
<h3>2. <a name="_EN_Toc_02">Content; User-Generated Content; Downloadable Content; Game Mods; Virtual Items; Unlinked Accounts</a></h3>
<p>This Section 2 shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>A. Content Generally</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Content</strong>&quot; includes technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, animations, animation-style videos, content, pictures, code, files, data, characters (inclusive of associated items and attributes), and all audio visual or other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from the Services, as well as the design and appearance of any websites under ZeniMax's control. All Content made available by ZeniMax, unless explicitly identified as third-party content, is the exclusive property of ZeniMax, its affiliates, and/or their licensors.</p>
<p>Except as necessary to use the Services in compliance with these Terms of Service, You may not copy, use or download any Content from a Service unless You are expressly authorized to do so by ZeniMax in writing. You acknowledge and agree that You shall not reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly perform, or transmit any Content for commercial uses unless You obtained the express written consent of an authorized representative of ZeniMax. For clarification purposes, &quot;derivative works based upon&quot; Services and/or Content are works that are substantially similar, both in ideas and expression, to Services and/or Content. Therefore, if You or someone else creates a work and it is likely to bring to mind either or both Services (such as a Game) and Content, then it is likely that such work is a derivative work and as such may not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>B. User-Generated Content</p>
<p>Content includes user-generated Content that You contribute, provide, post, upload, or otherwise submit to ZeniMax via a Service (&quot;<strong>UGC</strong>&quot;), provided that the term UGC does not include Game Mods (as defined below).</p>
<p>UGC includes any photographs, images, video, music, sounds, and other data that You contribute, provide, post, upload, or otherwise submit to ZeniMax via a Service (collectively, &quot;<strong>Your UGC</strong>&quot;).</p>

ZeniMax Owned UGC also includes all Content (other than Game Mods (as defined below)) that You create or develop using Content provided or made available by ZeniMax, including but not limited to Content that You create or develop that is a derivative work of the Content provided or made available by ZeniMax.

<p>ZeniMax does not pre-screen UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that You and other users may contribute, provide, post, upload, or otherwise submit via the Services. You bear full and exclusive responsibility for Your UGC, and You may be held legally accountable for any UGC that You contribute, provide, post, upload, or otherwise submit.</p>
<p>You may not contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit any UGC that is copyrighted, protected by trademark or trade secret law, or otherwise subject to third-party intellectual property rights, or other rights such as privacy and publicity rights, unless You own those rights free and clear or have written permission from their rightful owner to contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit such UGC and to grant or assign the described license and property rights to ZeniMax as described below.</p>
<p>As between You and ZeniMax, You will be the owner of all of Your UGC (as defined above). To the fullest extent permitted by law, You hereby expressly grant (or You warrant that the owner of Your UGC has expressly granted) to ZeniMax and its licensors, licensees, and designees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicensees) right and license to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with Your UGC in all formats and media, whether existing now or in the future, and to the extent permitted by applicable law You agree not to assert or enforce any moral rights or similar rights You may have which may now or may hereafter be recognized, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights, in any languages now known or not currently known.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or regulation, by contributing, providing, posting, uploading, or otherwise submitting ZeniMax Owned UGC or creating ZeniMax Owned UGC, You acknowledge and agree that all such ZeniMax Owned UGC is the sole property of ZeniMax and You hereby assign and agree to assign to ZeniMax all such ZeniMax Owned UGC contributed, provided, posted, uploaded, or otherwise submitted by You and such assignment will be effective on the date the ZeniMax Owned UGC is created. To the extent that ZeniMax cannot claim exclusive ownership rights in such ZeniMax UGC by operation of law or pursuant to the assignment above, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, You hereby expressly grant (or You warrant that the owner of such ZeniMax Owned UGC has expressly granted) to ZeniMax and its licensors, licensees and designees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicensees) right and license to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with such ZeniMax Owned UGC in all formats and media, whether existing now or in the future, and to the extent permitted by applicable law You agree not to assert or enforce any moral rights or similar rights You may have which may now or may hereafter be recognized, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights, in any languages now known or not currently known.</p>
<p>You further grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access UGC and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such UGC as permitted through the Services, including, but not limited to, Service and/or Game functionality.</p>
<p>If so required under applicable law, You will enter into any agreement or undertake any action as deemed necessary by ZeniMax to effect the licenses described above in this Section.</p>
<p>IN ALL CASES OF UGC UNDER THIS SECTION 2, EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZENIMAX RESERVES THE RIGHT (BUT HAS NO OBLIGATION EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW) TO REVIEW, REMOVE, BLOCK, EDIT, MOVE, OR DISABLE UGC FOR ANY REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AND HAS NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO UGC, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WHEN ZENIMAX DETERMINES THAT UGC VIOLATES THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in ZeniMax's sole and final discretion. To the maximum extent permitted by law, ZeniMax does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for its removal or for any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.</p>
<p>C. Downloadable Content, Achievements, and Other Virtual Items</p>
<p>Content also includes Content that is downloaded or downloadable from any website authorized by or under ZeniMax's control (&quot;<strong>Downloadable Content</strong>&quot;), provided that the term Downloadable Content does not include Game Mods (as defined below). Downloadable Content includes, but is not limited to, licensed rights granted, awarded, and/or provided to You to access and/or use online or off-line elements or features of certain Services as well as Game updates, unlockable Content, digital and/or virtual assets, rights of use tied to unlock keys or codes, merchandise redemption codes, serial codes and/or online authentication of any kind, in-game achievements, video trailers, Game screenshots, and/or Game-related wallpapers. Downloadable Content also includes Virtual Currency, and Virtual Currency is subject to additional terms and restrictions specific to Virtual Currency as set forth below in Section 2(E), which additional terms and restrictions supersede any inconsistent terms and restrictions applicable to Downloadable Content generally.</p>
<p>Downloadable Content may be free, redeemable, and/or purchased, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, ZeniMax reserves the right to change the price of Downloadable Content at any time, without notice.</p>
<p>Downloadable Content may only be held in Accounts or on devices belonging to legal residents of countries where access to and receipt, play, or use of the Services and Downloadable Content are permitted. Except as granted in a Game's EULA, ZeniMax hereby grants to You a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable license to use, view, and display Downloadable Content that You have lawfully downloaded.</p>
<p>Once You have redeemed Downloadable Content, that Content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content or for cash, or other goods or services unless approved by ZeniMax or required by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1); for example, if ZeniMax provided the wrong Content to You, You may be entitled to a refund. Unless otherwise specified by ZeniMax in writing and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), Downloadable Content may expire upon the earlier of (a) the closure of an Account, or (b) the later of one hundred and eighty (180) days past (i) the most recent Account login by You or (ii) the end of Your Membership for the applicable Service if such Membership is not renewed.</p>
<p>You agree that You have no ownership right or title in or to any such Downloadable Content, including, but not limited to, the virtual goods appearing or originating in the Services (such as a Game) or any other attributes associated with any Account or Services. ZeniMax does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property executed outside of the Game, or the purported sale, gift, or trade in the &quot;real world&quot; of anything that appears or originates in a Service or a Game. Accordingly, You may not sell, and You may not assist others in selling, Service(s) or in-Game items for real currency, or exchange those items for value outside of the Services. Evidence of any attempt to redeem Downloadable Content for a purported exchange, sale, gift, or trade in the &quot;real world&quot; will result in the immediate suspension or termination of Your Account or Membership. You acknowledge and agree that all virtual items represent a limited license right for Your personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, and limited use governed by these Terms of Service and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from ZeniMax at any time. ZeniMax reserves the right to refuse Your request(s) to acquire Downloadable Content, and reserves the right to limit or block any request to acquire Downloadable Content for any or no reason.</p>
<p>D. Game Mods</p>
<p>Content also includes Game Mods. The term &quot;<strong>Game Mod</strong>&quot; means downloadable, user-generated Content developed or created by You or a third party using an Editor Tool (as defined below). In certain cases, as determined by ZeniMax, Game Mods may be made available to other users of a Service or a Game and in such cases, such other users may download the Game Mods from ZeniMax or third parties and use such Game Mods in connection with playing a Game or receiving a Service from ZeniMax.</p>
<p>If You desire to develop or create one or more Game Mods, then You will be required to download from a ZeniMax website or otherwise gain access to via a ZeniMax website one or more software tools through which You may create or develop Game Mods (each such tool is an &quot;<strong>Editor Tool</strong>&quot;). To obtain a copy of or get access to any such Editor Tool, You will be required to agree to the terms of a separate EULA (the &quot;<strong>Editor EULA</strong>&quot;). If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions in any such Editor EULA and the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service, the terms in the Editor EULA will control over the conflicting terms in these Terms of Service but solely for the purpose of the specific Editor Tool and not for any other purpose. Please review the terms in the Editor EULA carefully.</p>
<p>With respect to Game Mods made available for download from a ZeniMax website or made available from a ZeniMax server, ZeniMax may, at any time and in its sole discretion, elect to remove such Game Mods from the ZeniMax website(s) or server(s) without notice to You.</p>
<p>Each Game Mod is owned by the developer of the Game Mod, subject to the licenses granted by the developer to ZeniMax as set forth in the Editor EULA.</p>
<p>ZeniMax may, but is not required under the Terms of Service to, validate, test, evaluate or pre-screen Game Mods.</p>
<p>ZeniMax does not endorse, sponsor, guarantee or approve any Game Mods, including without limitation Game Mods available for download from a ZeniMax website.</p>
<p>Your experience with any particular Game Mod may vary from other users' experiences.</p>
<p>IF YOU ELECT TO INSTALL, DOWNLOAD OR USE ANY GAME MODS, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZENIMAX RESERVES THE RIGHT (BUT HAS NO OBLIGATION EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW) TO OFFER, MAKE AVAILABLE, REVIEW, REMOVE, BLOCK, EDIT, MOVE OR DISABLE GAME MODS FOR ANY REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AND HAS NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO GAME MODS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WHEN ZENIMAX DETERMINES THAT A GAME MOD VIOLATES THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE EDITOR EULA. THE DECISION TO REMOVE A GAME MOD AT ANY TIME IS IN ZENIMAX'S SOLE AND FINAL DISCRETION.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), ZeniMax does not assume any responsibility or liability for Game Mods or for the removal of any Game Mods for any failure to or delay in removing, any Game Mod.</p>
<p>E. Virtual Currency</p>
<p>The Services may make use of one or more virtual currencies, either within a single Service, such as a Game, or for use across multiple Services (&quot;<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>&quot;). The following terms govern the use of Virtual Currency in connection with the Services. Additional Virtual Currency-related terms may be contained in the EULA for a particular Game and, where there is a conflict between such terms and this Section 2(E), the Virtual Currency-related terms in the EULA shall govern.</p>
<p>Virtual Currency may be obtained in one or more ways depending on the type of Virtual Currency and the Service or Services associated with that Virtual Currency, including without limitation Virtual Currency that may be obtained through purchase with real currency, in-Game actions, or achievements, as a part of Membership benefits, or otherwise. ZeniMax may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, grant Virtual Currency to users of one or more Services as a gesture of goodwill or in connection with promotions, Memberships, competitions, or sweepstakes organized by ZeniMax. All Virtual Currency that is purchased with real currency, either alone or together with other Services or access to or receipt, play or use of Services (including without limitation payment for Memberships), shall be referred to as &quot;<strong>Purchased Virtual Currency.</strong>&quot; All Virtual Currency that is not Purchased Virtual Currency shall be referred to as &quot;<strong>Complimentary Virtual Currency.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Regardless of the method by which You obtain a Virtual Currency and subject only to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), it has no value in real currency, and is not transferable to any other person, or returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for real currency, goods, or services. By purchasing or otherwise obtaining Virtual Currency, You acknowledge and agree that all Virtual Currencies represent a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for Your personal, private, non-commercial use of Services governed by these Terms of Service. Because it is a license, Virtual Currency is not property in which You have any ownership right, title, or other interest. Any Virtual Currency balance shown in Your Account or Membership does not constitute a real currency balance or reflect any monetary value.</p>
<p>ZeniMax reserves the right to change the price for any Purchased Virtual Currency or to bundle Purchased Virtual Currency in any amount with other Services or access to other Services at any time and without providing notice to You. You will have no right to a price adjustment or other refund as a result of any change in the price or bundling at which Purchase Virtual Currency can be obtained, subject only to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1). In the case of Complimentary Virtual Currency, ZeniMax reserves the right to change or limit the amount of Complimentary Virtual Currency granted as part of any ongoing or continuous promotion, to discontinue any promotion, or to bundle Complimentary Virtual Currency in any amount with other Services or access to other Services at any time and without providing notice to You.</p>
<p>Virtual Currency is not transferable to, or redeemable for, any sum of real currency or monetary value from ZeniMax or any other person at any time. ZeniMax prohibits, and does not recognize any purported, transfers, sales, gifts, or trades of Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency will only be used by You to obtain virtual goods within a Game (e.g., durable goods that become part of Your inventory in the Game and consumable or single use items that are used and expire after use within the Game) other Downloadable Content, or Game Mod through one or more Services, as determined by ZeniMax in its sole discretion. You agree not to sell or transfer, or assist others in selling or transferring, Virtual Currencies or any amounts thereof. Evidence of any attempt to use, sell or transfer Virtual Currency in any manner that violates these Terms of Service may result in revocation, termination, or cancellation of the Virtual Currency and/or Your access to or receipt, play or use of the Services without refund and/or immediate suspension or termination of Your Account.</p>
<p>Subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), You acknowledge and agree that ZeniMax will have no liability for the use or loss of Downloadable Content (including without limitation Virtual Currency) for any reason, including without limitation due to any activity of a third-party, such as hacking, phishing, or any other unauthorized activity. ZeniMax may replace such lost Virtual Items under certain circumstances, in ZeniMax's sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any obligation or liability.</p>
<p><strong>EXPIRING VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR RESIDENTS OF JAPAN</strong></p>
<p>IF YOU LIVE IN JAPAN the terms in this paragraph will apply. Virtual Currency shall be valid for SIX (6) MONTHS from the date on which the Virtual Currency is acquired or purchased. Virtual Currency is used in order of its respective expiration date, where Virtual Currency with the earliest expiration date is used PRIOR TO any other Virtual Currency. If Purchased Virtual Currency and Complimentary Virtual Currency are issued concurrently, Purchased Virtual Currency is used prior to Complimentary Virtual Currency. Upon the expiration of the period for which Virtual Currency is valid, such Virtual Currency will expire and have no further value. Even if Your Account or Your access to or receipt, play or use of some or any Services is restricted or suspended in accordance with these Terms of Service, such restriction or suspension does not interrupt the period for which Virtual Currency is valid, and Virtual Currency will expire upon the expiration of such period. If Your Account or Your access to or use, receipt or play of some or any Services is terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service, all Virtual Currency held by You will expire immediately upon such termination. ZeniMax may limit the amount of Virtual Currency that You can purchase, hold, or use within a certain period.</p>
<p>F. Unlinked Accounts</p>
<p><strong>Warning for Unlinked Accounts</strong>. To the extent ZeniMax in its sole discretion permits You to download or play a Game without having an Account or without linking that Game to Your Account (including without limitation enabling You to purchase, receive, or download any Downloadable Content (including without limitation any Virtual Currency) for such Game), then if You purchase, receive or download Downloadable Content using a device that is not linked to an Account, and Your device is lost, stolen or damaged or Your device or data is hacked, then such Downloadable Content as well as Your UGC, game settings, data, in-game achievements and in-game purchases will be lost and ZeniMax will not be able to and ZeniMax will not restore such Downloadable Content or Your UGC, game settings, data, in-game achievements or in-game purchases. SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZENIMAX SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR, AND ALL RISK OF LOSS SHALL BE BORN BY YOU WITH REGARDS TO, ANY DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT, GAME SETTINGS, DATA, IN-GAME ACHIEVEMENTS, AND IN-GAME PURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCESS TO OR PURCHASE, RECEIPT, DOWNLOAD, PLAY OR USE OF DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT USING A DEVICE THAT IS NOT LINKED TO AN ACCOUNT.</p>
<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_03">3. Limited License to Use</a></h3>
<p>Subject to the terms in these Terms of Service and Your compliance with all of the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service, ZeniMax grants to You, for Your personal, private and non-commercial use only, a non-exclusive, revocable, nontransferable license to access, receive, play, and use Services (including any Content which is made available by ZeniMax (including but not limited to Game Mods that You download from a ZeniMax website) as a part of a Service and then solely in connection with such Service) as set forth in these Terms of Service. In the case of Games and Software made available for download, the foregoing license includes the right to download and install a single copy of the Game or Software on a single computer, console or mobile device owned by You for Your personal, private and non-commercial use.</p>
<p>You may not (a) distribute, publicly perform or display, sell, transmit, publish, edit, reproduce, sublicense, rent, lease, loan or otherwise transfer any Game, Software, and/or Content, including without limitation any access keys; (b) modify, adapt, reverse engineer or decompile the Software, or otherwise attempt to derive source code or anti-cheating measures from the Software; (c) create any derivative works based upon any Services; (d) otherwise access, receive, play or use any Services except as expressly provided in these Terms of Service; (e) copy or download any Software or Content unless the Content is a Game Mod available for download from a ZeniMax website or is Downloadable Content (other than Virtual Currency) or You are otherwise expressly authorized to do so in writing by ZeniMax; and/or (f) remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to any Services. Any commercial use or play of a Service (including but not limited to eSports and multiplayer video game competitions) is prohibited absent written permission by an authorized representative of ZeniMax.</p>
<p>ZeniMax actively enforces its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law. If You are found to engage or facilitate the engagement of infringing and/or illegal activity, including, but not limited to, making unauthorized copies and/or distributing Services, ZeniMax may in its sole discretion restrict, suspend, or terminate Your Account or Your access to or use, play or receipt of some or any Services, and/or pursue further legal action against You. Please note that these activities may constitute civil wrongs and/or criminal offenses and ZeniMax reserves the right to take such action as appropriate in the circumstances. You agree to reimburse ZeniMax for any liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses incurred by or suffered by ZeniMax arising from or related to any attempted or actual unauthorized or illegal conduct by You, or through the use of Your Account as more particularly described in Section 13.</p>
<p>ZeniMax reserves title to the Services and all rights to any Services not specifically granted under these Terms of Service, including without limitation all rights of reproduction, modification, distribution, display, disassembly and decompilation, and all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other proprietary and intellectual property rights and interests. Your access to and receipt, play, and use of Services is subject to the intellectual property rights of ZeniMax and except for the express licenses granted in the first paragraph of this Section 3, ZeniMax does not grant You any licenses or rights to patents or other proprietary or intellectual property rights. Content, Software, and Games are licensed, not sold, to You. You acknowledge and agree that in the case of Games that are made available as a service, (i) You might not have a copy of the Game on Your computer, mobile device, or console, as the case may be, (ii) You will access and play the Game via the Internet, and (iii) You must have a persistent Internet connection to access and play the Game.</p>
<p>All Services and all intellectual property rights in the Services are owned by ZeniMax or its licensors and are protected by United States, other jurisdictions, and international copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other laws protecting intellectual property and related proprietary rights. With the exception of the licenses granted to You in the first paragraph of this Section 3, this Section 3 shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service. ZeniMax may, in its discretion, make available to You one or more application programming interfaces and associated documentation (each an &quot;<strong>API</strong>&quot;) to allow You to access, create, download, enable, use, or associate Content (excluding Game Mods), that modifies or otherwise provides enhanced features to the user interface (&quot;<strong>Add-ons</strong>&quot;) for a Game. The API and Add-ons are Software for purposes of these Terms of Service and are subject to these Terms of Service and the Supplemental Terms applicable to the API and the Add-Ons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, if the Supplemental Terms for an API or Add-on directly conflict with specific terms and conditions in these Terms of Service or any other Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms for an API or Add-on will control, but solely for purpose of the specific API and Add-on and not for any other purpose.</p>
<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_04">4. Beta Tests and Free Trials</a></h3>
<p>In its sole discretion, ZeniMax may contact You to review and evaluate, or playtest, one or more Games, aspects of Games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors and obtaining feedback. You will be asked to provide to ZeniMax certain feedback and suggestions regarding Your evaluation of the Game(s) or feature(s). Your participation is subject to these Terms of Service and other applicable Supplemental Terms, such as a beta testing agreement and a non-disclosure agreement. By accepting our invitation and playtesting the Game and/or features, You also agree that to the extent permitted by law: (i) playing an unreleased Game is at Your own risk and You understand that the Game and/or Game features may include known or unknown bugs or other errors, (ii) any value or status indicators that You achieve through any playtest may be erased at any time, including, but not limited to, upon commercial release; and (iii) ZeniMax has no obligation to make these Games or features available, or available without charge or to fix errors or bugs identified by You.</p>
<p>Beta Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.</p>
<p>For some Services, ZeniMax may elect to offer You access to a trial Game and/or a trial Membership. Such Services may require You to sign up for an Account and/or a Membership under the terms described in these Terms of Service. If You accept a free Game trial or a trial Membership for a Game that requires a Membership, and the trial period expires, (i) in the case of access to a trial Game, You will no longer be able to access the Game without purchasing it and (ii) in the case of a trial Membership, You will no longer receive the benefits of the Membership unless, where necessary, You update or complete Your information and purchase the paid Membership Services. ZeniMax is under no obligation to notify You in advance of the free trial Game access or Membership expiring and You will be responsible for all charges incurred. Just like paid Memberships, Accounts, and Beta Test accounts, trial Game access and Memberships are non-transferable under any circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_05">5. Paid Services</a></h3>
<p>Some Services require payment of a fee. You must pay the then-current applicable fees to access, play, participate in, or receive those Services, and You may be required to have an Account.</p>
<p>For information about fees for particular Services, including Membership fees, You should visit the particular Service's product web page, contact Customer Support at <a href="https://help.bethesda.net" target="_blank">help.bethesda.net</a> or, if applicable, consult with the Reseller (as defined below) of the Services.</p>
<p>The fees displayed for Services are subject to change at any time and from time to time without notice except as set out below.</p>
<p>You might purchase Services from ZeniMax or from one or more of ZeniMax's authorized resellers. The ZeniMax authorized resellers include, without limitation (i) the reseller(s) of Services offered on <strong><a href="https://bethesda.net" target="_blank">Bethesda.net</a></strong> or requiring a <strong><a href="https://bethesda.net" target="_blank">Bethesda.net</a></strong> account, (ii) console manufacturers, and (iii) other authorized resellers (collectively (i) - (iii), &quot;<strong>Resellers</strong>&quot;).</p>
<p>If You purchase Services from a Reseller, then (a) You will be making payments to such Reseller for such Services and (b) the fees for the Services and the applicable payment terms will be established by the Reseller.</p>
<p>In connection with payments made to Resellers, the Resellers will collect personal information from You, including without limitation credit card, debit card and other payment information. Your disclosure of information to a Reseller and Your purchases of Services from a Reseller will be subject to the Reseller's terms of service and Privacy Policy (collectively, the &quot;<strong>Reseller Terms</strong>&quot;). The Reseller Terms are in addition to these Terms of Service and the ZeniMax Media Privacy Policy. For clarity, these Terms of Service will apply to all such Services as if such Services had been purchased from ZeniMax. The Reseller Terms do not modify or amend these Terms of Service or the ZeniMax Media Privacy Policy. If You purchase Services from a Reseller, then the terms below in this Section 5 (Paid Services) will not apply to such purchases. If You purchase Services from ZeniMax, then the terms below in this Section 5 (Paid Services) will apply.</p>
<p>If You purchase Services from ZeniMax on <strong>The Elder Scrolls® Online</strong> PC/Mac Store, and</p>
<p>(i) if You live in North America, Central America, South America, or Asia, then You will be making payments to Bethesda Softworks LLC (&quot;<strong>Bethesda</strong>&quot;), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware USA, or</p>
<p>(ii) if You live in any other country, then You will be making payments to ZeniMax Europe Limited (&quot;<strong>ZEL</strong>&quot;), a company registered under the laws of England and Wales, with company registration number: 6333300 ( <strong>registered address</strong> : The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS. VAT number: 922 0616 57) (in either case, as such payments are more particularly described in paid Services in this Section 5 (Paid Services) below).</p>

<p><strong>FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.</strong></p>
<p>ZeniMax reserves the right to change ZeniMax's fees or billing methods at any time and, in the case of periodic fees, upon notice to You through Your Account or through the Services as set out below.</p>
<p>If You pay or are required to pay a periodic (e.g., monthly) Membership fee for a Service purchased from ZeniMax, then ZeniMax will provide You with at least thirty-five (35) days advance notice of any such changes. Your continued access to or receipt, play or use of the Service thirty-five (35) days or more after ZeniMax provides such notice of the changes means that You accept such changes. If any change is unacceptable to You, You may cancel Your Membership at any time (see Section 7 below) with such termination being effective at the end of the then-current Membership term or rolling period for which You previously paid, but ZeniMax will not refund any fees or prorate fees for any Membership except where a refund is required by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1).</p>
<p>If Your access to or receipt, play or use of the Services is subject to applicable governmental charges (including but not limited to sales tax, value added tax (VAT), goods and service tax (GST) or other taxes), then You must pay for those charges. Your total price may include such governmental charges or such governmental charges may be separately identified from Your paid Service(s) fees as shown during the payment process. Failure to invoice You for any such charges does not relieve You of the liability to pay such charges.</p>
<p>As the designated Account holder, You bear sole responsibility for all charges incurred on Your Account, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes, and the fees for all purchases made by You or anyone that uses Your Account, including, but not limited to, Your relatives, acquaintances, or friends.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted and where applicable, for Your purchases of downloadable Games and other Services on or from <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls® Online PC/Mac Store</a>, upon logging into Your <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/" target="_blank">Your Elder Scrolls Online Account</a>, the Game or any Downloadable Content that You purchase will be downloaded to You and will be applied to Your Account or the Game, as the case may be, upon purchase.</p>
<p>i. Residents in North America, Central America, South America, and Asia. **If You live in North America, Central America, South America, or Asia and purchase Services from ZeniMax, then You must pay fees using the payment methods made available by ZeniMax for the particular Service (the &quot;<strong>Payment Methods</strong>&quot;) and You agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each Payment Method You choose. Payment Methods may vary by Service and the terms of Your Membership will be in Your Account details, or if You are making a purchase on a device without using an Account, such details will be provided at the time of purchase. When You provide credit card or other Payment Method information in order to make a purchase from Bethesda, You represent to Bethesda that You are the authorized user of the credit card or other Payment Method. You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for Your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep Your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and You must promptly notify Bethesda if Your credit card or other Payment Method is canceled (for example, for loss, theft, or expiration). Changes to Your Payment Method information can be made by contacting Customer Support at <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/" target="_blank">help.bethesda.net</a>.</p>
<p>Some Payment Methods require or permit You to choose automatic renewal of Your Membership. In such cases, You are agreeing to permit Bethesda to automatically charge Your credit card, bank card, debit card or other Payment Method associated with Your Account for an automatic renewal of Your current Membership preferences to the applicable Service.

In order to sign up for automatic renewal, You must keep a valid credit card number or other Payment Method number or information associated with Your Account. Your Membership will automatically renew on the expiration date of the then-current Membership term or rolling period at a fee no greater than Bethesda's then-current price at the time of renewal, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless You cancel Your Membership.

<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_15">15. Dispute Resolution, Binding Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver</a></h3>
<p><strong>If You live in the EEA/UK/Switzerland/Australia/New Zealand/Turkey/Japan/Brazil</strong>, only this first paragraph of this Section 15 applies to You. You and ZeniMax will try to resolve any disagreements that arise between us promptly and efficiently. You and ZeniMax may agree to refer any disputed matter to resolution proceedings other than in a court but if not, You or ZeniMax may bring court proceedings at any time which to the extent required by applicable law, will be in your jurisdiction. The European Commission has an online dispute resolution platform: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. To bring a matter to our attention, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d22293f030219040e082d17080304000c15430e0200"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a2ede6f0cccdd6cbc1c7e2d8c7cccbcfc3da8cc1cdcf">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We will not participate in dispute settlement proceedings before a consumer arbitration board or scheme.</p>
<p><strong>If You live in the United States or most other countries (except those listed in the paragraph just above)</strong>, all of the terms below in this Section 15 apply to You. Please read them.</p>
<p>You and ZeniMax agree that all Disputes (defined below) shall be resolved only by binding, individual arbitration. You and ZeniMax are giving up the right to sue in court before a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator decides the Dispute; the arbitrator's decision is final, subject to very limited review in court. For the purpose of this Section 15, &quot;<strong>ZeniMax</strong>&quot; includes its affiliates (including Microsoft), and each of their officers, directors, employees, and agents. &quot;<strong>Dispute</strong>&quot; means any dispute, claim, or controversy between You and ZeniMax arising out of or relating to the Services or any aspect of Your relationship with ZeniMax, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes, but is not limited to, the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Section 15. &quot;Dispute&quot; is to be given the broadest possible meaning.</p>
<p>YOU AND ZENIMAX AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (AND NOT CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATION) RATHER THAN IN COURT OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>A. Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. You and ZeniMax must first give the other an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification of the Dispute to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA. Include Your (1) full legal name, (2) mailing address, (3) User Name, (4) the email address associated with Your Account or Membership, (5) the platform(s) and device(s) You typically use to access the Services, (6) a written description of Your Dispute, and (7) what relief You seek. We will send You a similar notification if we have a Dispute with You. If the Dispute is not resolved within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the notification, You or ZeniMax may initiate an arbitration proceeding. You may bring Your Dispute in court only in small claims court or if You opt out of arbitration within 30 days from the date You first consent to these Terms of Service, as described in the paragraph just below.</p>
<p>B. Small Claims Court and Right to Opt Out of Arbitration Within 30 Days. You or ZeniMax may pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration only (a) in small claims court where You live or in Rockville, MD, as You choose; or (b) IF YOU OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (the &quot;<strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>&quot;). You may opt out by mailing written notification to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA. Your written notification must include Your (1) full legal name, (2) mailing address, (3) User Name, (4) the email address associated with Your Account or Membership, and (5) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes through arbitration. Your decision to opt out will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with ZeniMax. You are responsible for ensuring ZeniMax's receipt of Your opt-out notice, and You therefore may wish to send a notice by means that provide a written receipt. <strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will be invalid and You must pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court</strong>.</p>
<p>C. Arbitration Procedures.</p>
<p>i. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 45 days of receipt of written notice of the Dispute, either You or ZeniMax may start an arbitration proceeding before the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;), <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>, if You live in North America, or before the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (&quot;<strong>ICDR</strong>&quot;), <a href="http://www.icdr.org/" target="_blank">www.icdr.org</a>, if You live anywhere else, in English before a single arbitrator. Any arbitration shall be individual and not a class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues with respect to Section 15, including, but not limited to, his or her own jurisdiction, whether we agreed to arbitrate any particular claim, and any alleged ambiguities in this Section 15. But if a person asserts that the parties agreed to a class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration, the court decides that issue.</p>
<p>ii. In Disputes before the AAA, the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. The ICDR's rules will apply to Disputes before that entity. AAA and ICDR rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> and <a href="http://www.icdr.org/" target="_blank">www.icdr.org</a>. This Agreement governs if it conflicts with the AAA or ICDR rules. Based on the class action waiver in subsection 15(C)(vii) below, under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>iii. Because the Services and these Terms of Service concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;<strong>FAA</strong>&quot;) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or conditions precedent to suit.</p>
<p>iv. Arbitration Decision (&quot;<strong>Award</strong>&quot;). The arbitrator may award You on an individual basis any damages or other relief a court could under applicable law and these Terms of Service, but will not have the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the arbitration. The arbitrator may not award injunctive or declaratory relief that would affect how You or ZeniMax treats persons who are not parties (sometimes called a &quot;<strong>public injunction</strong>&quot;). The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by You or ZeniMax, but no such statement will have any precedential effect. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for review under the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for enforcement.</p>
<p>v. Location of Arbitration. If You live in North America, You or ZeniMax may initiate arbitration in either Rockville, Maryland, USA or the judicial district that includes the address You provide in Your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. If You do not live in North America, the arbitration shall take place in London, England, Sydney, Australia, or a major city such as a county or provincial seat in the country where You live, as requested by You.</p>
<p>vi. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. ZeniMax will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's fees and expenses upon Your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration or as otherwise required by applicable law or arbitration rules. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if You provide timely notice and negotiate in good faith with ZeniMax as provided in the subsection above titled &quot;<strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>&quot; and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>vii. Class Action Waiver. Any arbitration proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Nor may arbitrations be joined together without the consent of all parties. <strong>If You pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out, as specified in Section 15(B) above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you</strong>. Neither You, any user of the Services, nor any other person, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise bring or participate in a class, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative suit or proceeding without having complied with those opt-out requirements.</p>
<p>D. Jury and Court Waiver. You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms of Service You and ZeniMax are waiving the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Section 15, You and ZeniMax might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Those rights are waived. Other rights that You would have if You went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration or may also be waived.</p>
<p>E. Severability. If anything within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver, subsection 15(C)(vii) above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, it will be severed from this Section 15, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be given full force and effect. If the prohibition on public injunctions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, it will be severed and, if the arbitrator finds in the final award that a party is liable, a court will then consider the request for public-injunctive relief as a remedy for the liability the arbitrator found. If the Class Action Waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 15 will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p>F. Continuation. This Section 15 shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service and Your use of the Services.</p>
<p>G. Rejecting Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Modifications. Notwithstanding ZeniMax's right to modify these Terms of Service, ZeniMax shall have no right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke this Section 15 (Dispute Resolution, Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) without giving You prior notice and an opportunity to reject the alteration, amendment, modification, or revocation. You may reject any change we make to this Section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail (or the postal service in Your country) to the address in Section 15(B). If You do, the most recent version of Section 15 before the change You rejected will apply. Please include your (1) full legal name, (2) mailing address, (3) User Name, (4) the email address associated with Your Account or Membership, and (5) a clear statement that You reject the changes to Section 15.</p>
<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_16">16. Unsolicited Materials</a></h3>
<p>ZeniMax has an established policy not to accept or consider any unsolicited material, ideas, or suggestions of any nature whatsoever. Please do not send us any unsolicited materials, as they will not be considered by anyone at ZeniMax. Any unsolicited materials sent will be treated as non-confidential, and ZeniMax will not be liable for any use or disclosure of such unsolicited material.</p>
<p>If You do send any creative materials, including, but not limited to, feedback, creative suggestions, error corrections, ideas, notes, drawings, fan art, storylines, music, concepts, data, or other Content that is not UGC or a Game Mod, transmitted via the Services, websites, U.S. Postal Service, Fed-Ex, mail, electronic mail or otherwise (collectively &quot;<strong>Information</strong>&quot;), such creative materials and communications shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be deemed to be the property of ZeniMax and You hereby assign and agree to assign to ZeniMax full and unfettered ownership of all such Information. None of the Information shall be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on the part of ZeniMax and ZeniMax shall not be liable to You for any use or disclosure of any Information. ZeniMax shall exclusively own any now known or hereafter existing rights to the Information of every kind and nature throughout the universe and on any media, and shall be entitled to unrestricted use and exploitation of the Information for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to, or approval by, You.</p>
<h3><a name="_EN_Toc_17">17. Intellectual Property Infringement</a></h3>
<p>ZeniMax respects the intellectual property rights of others, and requires that those who access, play, receive, purchase, or use its Services do the same. ZeniMax will terminate the Account and access to, receipt, play or use of the Services of any user who is responsible for any act(s) of intellectual property infringement. You may not, and by accessing, playing, receiving, or using the Services You agree not to, access or use the Services to transmit material: (i) that is copyrighted, unless You are the copyright owner or have obtained the permission of the copyright owner to transmit it; (ii) that reveals trade secrets, unless You own them or have the permission of the owner to so transmit them; or (iii) that infringes on any Intellectual Property Rights, as defined below, of others or violates the privacy or rights of publicity of others. For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term &quot; <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>&quot; means, collectively, rights under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and any other intellectual property or proprietary rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction worldwide, including, without limitation, moral rights, and similar rights.</p>
