</ul>
<p><strong>Not Covered by this Policy.</strong> This Policy does not apply to job applicants and candidates who apply for employment with us, or to employees and non-employee workers in the context of our working relationship with them. This Policy also does not apply to any third-party websites, services, products or mobile applications maintained by other companies, which are linked to from our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate and Non-Identifiable Information.</strong> Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we may collect, use, share, disclose, and otherwise process aggregate, anonymous, and in some cases de-identified information related to our business and the Services for research, marketing, analytics, and other purposes.

<h3><a name="_EN_PP_02" class="gl-link-checked">2. Personal Information We Collect</a></h3>
<p>ZeniMax collects personal information directly from Users, automatically related to the use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties (e.g., social networks, platform providers, payment processors, and operators of certain third-party services that we use). The information we collect about Users varies depending upon the circumstances, such as the games or other Services used.</p>

<p>The personal information that we collect varies depending upon your use of our Services and our interactions with you. It includes:</p>
<ul>

Depending upon the Service, we may receive your username, name, email, payment type, product(s) or service(s) purchased, and other transaction details, and we may maintain records of your purchase and subscription history.</li>
<li>
<em>Marketing, contests, promotions, and events</em>: You can sign up online or in-person (e.g., at tradeshows, conferences, and the like) to receive direct marketing communications from us, including emails about game launches, developments, and upcoming releases. If you agree to receive direct marketing communications from us, we will collect your email address, and we may also collect your name, preferences, and if relevant, information about your account and the Services and other games you use. We may also collect your name, age, email address, and other information in connection with contests, sweepstakes or other events or activities on our websites and social media channels. If you attend our events, we may collect the data you provide to us when registering for or during the event, and may also process your image and voice data if the event is recorded.</li>
<li>
<em>Your communications</em>: When you email us, call us, chat with us, or otherwise send us communications regarding the Services, we collect and maintain a record of your contact details, communications, and our responses.

<li>
<em>Business partners and others:</em> We may collect and receive personal information about current, former and prospective vendors, business partners, and others with whom we have a business relationship. Generally, this information may include name, company information, payment and contact details, and communications records.

You may also be able to access certain games and other Services or interact with us and others about the Services through Third-Party Platforms, without logging in to our Services or registering with us. In each of these circumstances, we may receive certain personal information from these Third-Party Platforms, subject to their respective policies and terms—for example, if you play a game through a Third-Party Platform, we may receive your username, console identifiers (e.g., XUID and PUID), IP address, MAC address, and other identifiers and device information, and if you communicate about us or the Services through third-party forums, we may collect and receive personal information such as username, email address, public profile information, and information you post about us and our Services.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<em>User IDs</em>: we assign Users a unique user identifier, which we use to identify and link relevant information to your activities within the Services (e.g., in-game information such as statistics, scores, achievements, and subscription levels). Some of our games also may allow Users to play without creating an account and/or registering with us. In such cases, we may assign you a guest user ID so that we can keep track of your game play, scores, stats, purchasing data, and usage data for your current and future sessions. If you later decide to register or create an account with us, we may associate your guest user ID and the data from your guest session(s) with your account.</li>

We and these third-party ad companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other tools (which we may refer to collectively as &quot;<strong>targeting cookies</strong>&quot;) to collect activity information within our Services (as well as on third-party sites and services), as well as IP address, location information, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers; we and these third-party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content within our Services and on third-party sites and apps, and to evaluate the success of such ads and content.

You can opt out of targeted advertising in our mobile games through the in-app settings for that game and/or by adjusting your device privacy settings (please refer to your device settings for more information). This means that you will no longer get targeted ads in the app; however, you may still receive contextual or general ads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Industry ad choice programs</em>: You can also control how participating third-party ad companies use the information that they collect about your visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications, and those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted advertising to you; for more information and to opt out of receiving targeted ads from participating third-party ad networks go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Users: <a href="https://aboutads.info/choices">https://aboutads.info/choices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance) (You can also download the DAA AppChoices tool in order to help control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device.)</li>

You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Lists and Matching.</strong> Subject to applicable law, we may share certain customer list information (such as your email address or other contact information, which in most cases is hashed when it is shared) with third parties so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services and other third-party platforms and services. These third parties use the personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we submit to target ads for third parties.

<strong>Browser Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of &quot;sales&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; (if applicable) via your browser on our websites by:

</ul>
<p><strong>Rights Under California's Shine-the-Light Law.</strong> We do not share personal information collected online with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes and will not do so unless you agree to such disclosure.

<p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals.</strong> Please note that our websites do not recognize or respond to any signal which your browser might transmit through the so-called &quot;Do Not Track&quot; feature your browser might have.

</li>
<li>
<p>to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of sensitive personal information by us.</p>
</li>

<p>In addition, you can also set your browser to transmit a &quot;global privacy control&quot; (GPC) signal or another approved &quot;universal opt-out mechanism&quot; to opt out of targeted advertising and sales (as defined under applicable law). If we detect that your browser is transmitting a GPC or other recognized universal opt-out signal when you visit one of our websites, we will opt that browser on your device out of targeting cookies on that website. Please note that if you come back to that website from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to apply the signal for that browser and/or device as well.</p>
