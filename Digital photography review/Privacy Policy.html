        We share user information with our affiliates that follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice, and as described
        below.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
            pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets
            related to DPReview.com are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

        <li>
            We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer

            Despite our efforts to ensure security, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personal information will not be accessed, acquired, disclosed,
            altered or destroyed by an unauthorized person or as a result of a breach of our security safeguards or those of our hosting provider or other
            vendors or service providers.  We cannot ensure the security of any data transmitted to us over the internet. To the fullest extent permitted by
            applicable law, we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure by us of personal information.

    <h3 id="interestbasedads">Interest-Based Ads</h3>
    <p>
        Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show interest-based ads to display features, products, and services
        that might be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <h4>What sort of information do we use to show interest-based ads?</h4>
    <p>
        To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with DPReview Services or content.
    </p>
    <p>
        As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, "cookies"), which enable us to understand the
        effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads.
        For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
    </p>
    <h4>How do we work with third parties to show you interest-based ads?</h4>
    <p>
        We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies
        working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with
        or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular
        geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for a certain camera). Some third-parties may provide us information about you
        (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant
        and useful advertising. For more information on the third parties we work with to show you interest-based ads, and to set your preferences for
        interest-based ads, visit the <a href="/misc/privacypreferences">Privacy Preferences</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads,
        directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the
        effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of us. For information on how to control and
        delete cookies (including third party cookies) please visit the <a href="#cookies">Cookies</a> section of this Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <h4>Advertising Preferences</h4>
    <p>
        We offer you choices about receiving interest-based ads. If you choose not to receive interest-based ads, you will still see ads  in the DPR Services
        but they will not be based on your interests. <span class="privacyPreferences">Please visit the <a href="/misc/privacypreferences">Privacy Preferences</a> 
        page to learn how to set your preferences.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the
        <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a> or who follow the
        <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN">Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>
        by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
