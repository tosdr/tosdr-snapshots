<h2 id="acceptance-of-terms-of-use">Acceptance of Terms of Use</h2>
<p>Please read these Terms of Use, <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="/pages/cookies">Cookies Policy</a> and <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, very carefully. If you do not agree to any of the provisions set out in those documents, you should not use the Platform. By accessing or using the Platform, registering an account, or by viewing, accessing, streaming, uploading or downloading any information or content from or to the Platform, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood these Terms of Use and <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, will abide by them, and that you are either 18 years of age or more, or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction, or if you are under 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you are 16 years of age or more if you reside in the European Union and UK or 13 years of age or more if you reside in the United States or anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-terms-of-use">Changes to Terms of Use</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change, alter, replace, or otherwise modify these Terms of Use at any time, for example to address legal or regulatory changes or changes to features or functionality made available through the Platform, at our sole discretion. The date of last modification is stated at the end of these Terms of Use. It is your responsibility to check this page from time to time for updates.</p>
<p>When we make any significant changes to these Terms of Use, we will provide you with prominent notice under the circumstances, including for example displaying a notice within the Platform and/or by sending you an email to the email address that you have provided us or a message to your SoundCloud account, and the revised Terms of Use will become effective two (2) weeks after such notification.</p>
<p>You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the <a href="#termination">Termination</a> section below during such two (2) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that two (2) week period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-the-platform">Description of the Platform</h2>
<p>The Platform is a music service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information ("<strong>Content</strong>"), which will be stored by SoundCloud at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform’s functions and as made available on the Platform. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another in open (i.e. publicly accessible) as well as private conversations (i.e. one-to-one messages) (“<strong>Platform Communications</strong>”) and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Platform (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.</p>
<p>The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and learn from the SoundCloud community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content that interests you most. For example, users who upload Content to SoundCloud will gain access to our Fan Insights feature, which provides creators with insights into how the Content they upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and downloaders of such Content. How data is used for the Fan Insights feature is described in our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pages/fan-insights">Fan Insights</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain Service (see <a href="#subscriptions-and-gift-codes">Subscriptions</a> below). SoundCloud however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe to such Services. In order to make the Platform available for free and provide you with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the Platform on behalf of third party advertisers. To that end, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform to inform the nature of the ads we show you and provide you with a customized experience. More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in our <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms and conditions that we may release for those specific services or features.</p>
<h2 id="your-soundcloud-account">Your SoundCloud account</h2>
<p>You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to the Apps and certain Services is only available to registered users. In order for you to engage with other SoundCloud fans and creators, we enable you to create and personalize a public profile on SoundCloud. To enable you to do that, you must provide us with the information you want to display on such a profile.</p>
<p>In an effort to help you navigate and discover content on our Platform, we provide auto-generated personalized recommendations for registered users. These recommendations, tailored to your interests, are based on two main parameters: firstly, how you use and interact with the Platform (for example, your likes, comments and play durations), and secondly, the similarity in the type of content that you engage with (for example, the tempo or genre of a track). Together these two parameters allow us to make unique recommendations for you across the Platform, for example in SoundCloud features such as “More of What you Like” and “Artists You Should Follow”.</p>
<p>When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account, whether or not such activity was authorized by you.</p>
<p>If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use or our <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time as described in the <a href="#termination">Termination</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="your-use-of-the-platform">Your use of the Platform</h2>

<h2 id="your-content">Your Content</h2>
<p>Any and all Content is uploaded, owned and controlled solely by you, and not by SoundCloud.</p>
<p>SoundCloud does not claim any ownership rights in your Content, and your Content remains your sole responsibility.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the conditions set forth in <a href="#your-use-of-the-platform">Your Use of the Platform</a> you must not upload, store, distribute, send, transmit, display, perform, make available, continue to make available or otherwise communicate to the public any Content to which you do not hold the necessary rights. In particular, any unauthorized use of copyright protected works within your Content, independent of whether it is or becomes unauthorized at a later point, may constitute an infringement of third party rights and is strictly prohibited. Any such infringements may result in termination of your access to the Platform as described in the Moderation and Enforcement Policy, and may also result in civil litigation or criminal prosecution by or on behalf of the relevant rightsholder.</p>
<p>Not all unauthorized uses of copyright protected works constitute an infringement. Exceptions to copyright exist under all legal systems and may be relied upon by users when using the Platform. In the EU, the following non-exhaustive list of exceptions are notably available to users: quotation, criticism, review, use for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, invite or provide you with means to provide feedback regarding the Platform, and in such circumstances, any feedback you provide will be deemed non-confidential and SoundCloud shall have the right, but not the obligation, to use such feedback on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<h2 id="grant-of-license">Grant of license</h2>
<p>By uploading or posting your Content to the Platform, you initiate an automated process to transcode any audio Content and direct SoundCloud to store your Content on our servers, from where you may control and authorize the use, ways of reproduction, transmission, distribution, public display, public performance, making available (including whether users will be permitted to listen to your Content offline) and other communication to the public of your Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution of advertising or other promotional material on our Platform and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licenses to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.</p>
<p>By uploading your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, license to other users of the Platform, and to operators and users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which your Content has been shared or embedded using the Services ("<strong>Linked Services</strong>"), to use, copy, listen to offline, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public, your Content utilizing the features of the Platform from time to time, and within the parameters set by you using the Services. In the absence of a separate agreement that states otherwise, You explicitly agree that your Content may be used to inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services as part of and for providing the services. For the avoidance of doubt, neither SoundCloud nor any third party is allowed to (i) use, copy or</p>
<p>reproduce any Content delivered to the Platform under separate agreements, which is owned or controlled by third party rights holders (including artwork, images, logos, audio and audiovisual recordings (and any part thereof), underlying musical works and lyrics, and metadata) for the purposes of informing, training developing (or as input to) artificial intelligence technologies without authorization from the applicable rightsholders. You can limit and restrict the availability of certain of your Content to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services, at any time using the permissions tab in the track edit section for each sound you upload, subject to the provisions of the <a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> section below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use grants any rights to any other user of the Platform with respect to any proprietary name, logo, trademark or service mark uploaded by you as part of your Content (for example, your profile picture) ("<strong>Marks</strong>"), other than the right to reproduce, publicly display, make available and otherwise communicate to the public those Marks, automatically and without alteration, as part of the act of reposting sounds with which you have associated those Marks.</p>
<p>The licenses granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of your Content that you upload to the Platform. Licenses with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your account. Licenses with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Platform will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account.</p>
<p>Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from SoundCloud’s systems and servers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that once your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, SoundCloud is not obligated to ensure the deletion of your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of your Content. Furthermore, if you authorize any of your Content to be available for offline listening, after deletion of an item of your Content or removal from the ability for other users to listen to the applicable Content offline, the applicable Content may still be temporarily available to other users of the Platform who saved the applicable Content for offline listening on their devices, but no longer than 30 days from the time of deletion.</p>
<p>Any Content other than your Content is the property of the relevant Uploader, and is or may be subject to copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such Content may not be downloaded, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, re-uploaded, republished, displayed, sold, licensed, made available or otherwise communicated to the public or exploited for any purposes except via the features of the Platform from time to time and within the parameters set by the Uploader on the Platform or with the express written consent of the Uploader. Where you repost another user’s Content, or include another user’s Content in a playlist or station or where you listen to another user’s Content offline, you acquire no ownership rights whatsoever in that Content. Subject to the rights expressly granted in this section, all rights in Content are reserved to the relevant Uploader.</p>
<h2 id="representations-and-warranties">Representations and warranties</h2>
<p>You hereby represent and warrant to SoundCloud as follows: (i) your Content, and each and every part thereof, is an original work by you, or you have obtained all rights, licenses, consents and permissions necessary in order to use at any and all times during any applicable use, and (if and where relevant) to authorize SoundCloud to use, your Content pursuant to these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the right to upload, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, share, publicly display, publicly perform, make available (including for listening offline) and otherwise communicate to the public your Content, and each and every part thereof, on, through or via the Platform, any and all Services and any Linked Services.</p>
<p>(ii) your Content and the availability thereof on the Platform does not and will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, performers’ rights, rights of privacy or publicity, or rights in confidential information.</p>
<p>(iii) You have obtained any and all necessary consents, permissions and/or releases from any and all persons appearing in your Content in order to include their name, voice, performance or likeness in your Content and to publish the same on the Platform and via any Linked Services.</p>
<p>(iv) your Content, including any comments that you may post on the Platform, will comply with all of the requirements set out in the section ‘Your use of the Platform’ above, and will not contain any content prohibited by these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>(v) your Content does not and will not create any liability on the part of SoundCloud, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and their respective employees, agents, directors, officers and/or shareholders. SoundCloud reserves the right to remove your Content, suspend or terminate your access to the Platform and/or pursue all legal remedies if we believe that any of your Content breaches any of the foregoing representations or warranties, or otherwise infringes another person's rights or violates any law, rule or regulation.</p>
<h2 id="liability-for-content">Liability for content</h2>
<p>SoundCloud stores content and other information at the direction, request and with the authorization of its users as a passive conduit and/or host for the uploading, storage and distribution of such content. SoundCloud does not have knowledge of, or control over, your Content. You are fully responsible for all of the Content that you upload, post or distribute to, on or through the Platform, and to the extent permissible by law, SoundCloud excludes all liability with respect to all content (including your Content) and the activities of its users with respect thereto.</p>
<p>SoundCloud does not review the content uploaded by its users, and neither SoundCloud nor its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders assume any duty to monitor the Platform.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, SoundCloud reserves the right to moderate content in accordance with our Moderation and Enforcement Policy.</p>
<p>SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders hereby exclude, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all liability which may arise from any content uploaded to the Platform by users, including, but not limited to, any claims for infringement of intellectual property rights, rights of privacy or publicity rights, any claims relating to publication of abusive, defamatory, pornographic, or obscene material, or any claims relating to the completeness, accuracy, currency or reliability of any information provided by users of the Platform. By using the Platform, you irrevocably waive the right to assert any claim with respect to any of the foregoing against SoundCloud or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers or shareholders.</p>

<p>Please provide detail. The more information we have regarding your claim, the quicker we can process your notice.</p>
<p>There are various ways in which you can report copyright infringement on SoundCloud.</p>
<p><strong>Using our webform</strong></p>
<p>You can file a report using this webform.</p>
<p><strong>Using the report button</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>a statement that you have identified tracks on SoundCloud which infringe your copyright or the copyright of a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act;</p></li>

<p>Content Restrictions</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block, remove, delete, limit or restrict access to any content at any time, without liability, including without limitation, if we have reason to believe that such content does or might infringe the rights of any third party, has been uploaded or posted in breach of these Terms of Use, our Community Guidelines, or applicable law, or is otherwise unacceptable to SoundCloud. If we remove or restrict access to your Content, where required by law we will notify you and explain the reason for our decision.</p>
<p>Individual Uploaders have control over the audio content that they store in their account from time to time and may remove any or all audio content or other content without notice.

<p>For more information about how we may take action on your Content, please refer to our Moderation and Enforcement Policy.</p>
<p>Repeat infringers</p>
<p>SoundCloud may suspend or terminate access to the Platform if SoundCloud determines, in its reasonable discretion or as requested under applicable law, that you have repeatedly breached these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, for example where your Content repeatedly breaches these Terms of Use. When considering if you have breached these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, and to determine the steps we will take as a result of that behavior such as duration of suspension, we will take into account factors and circumstances such as the nature, number, seriousness and gravity of any such infringements, and all types of content uploaded in breach of our Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For users in the European Union (EU), you also have the option to refer our decision to any independent out-of-court dispute settlement body certified by the Digital Services Coordinator in the Member State in which you reside.

<h2 id="data-protection-privacy-and-cookies">Data protection, privacy, and cookies</h2>
<p>All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by SoundCloud in accordance with our <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. In addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can continue to improve the service we offer. Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our <a href="/pages/cookies">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="meetups">Meetups</h2>
<p>SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world ("Meetups"). While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.</p>
<h2 id="competitions-and-other-promotions">Competitions and other promotions</h2>
<p>From time to time, some SoundCloud users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the Platform ("Third Party Competitions"). SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.</p>
<p>If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available <a href="/pages/competition">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-soundcloud-players-and-widget">Use of SoundCloud players and widget</h2>
<p>The Platform includes access to customizable players ("Players"), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player ("Widget") for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.</p>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason at its sole discretion.</p>
<h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to an Artist Subscription or to a Fan Subscription, (Artist and Fan Subscriptions&nbsp; are each referred to as a "Subscription").</p>
<p>The purchase of Artist Subscriptions is subject to additional terms, which you will find <a href="/terms-of-use-pro">here</a>. In addition, the purchase of Fan Subscriptions is subject to additional terms, which you will find <a href="/go-terms-of-use">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Artist Terms and Fan Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your EU right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.</p>
<p>The Artist Terms are applicable to Next Pro users and the Fan Terms are applicable to SoundCloud Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription. SoundCloud reserves the right to limit the availability of SoundCloud Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as may be determined by SoundCloud in its sole discretion from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-the-platform-accounts-and-pricing">Changes to the Platform, accounts, and pricing</h2>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance.</p>
<p>You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the <a href="#termination">Termination</a> section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.</p>
<h2 id="termination">Termination</h2>
<p>You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of your Content from your account, or by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Subscription, and terminate this Agreement before the end of such Subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your Subscription.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a <a href="#repeat-infringers">Repeat Infringer</a> as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: <a href="#your-use-of-the-platform">Your Use of the Platform</a>, <a href="#your-content">your Content</a>, <a href="#grant-of-license">Grant of Licence</a> , and <a href="#representations-and-warranties">Your Representations and Warranties</a>; (iii) SoundCloud elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion. If you have a Subscription and your account is suspended or terminated by SoundCloud pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your Content), will be irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active.</p>
<p>If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website. The provisions of these Terms of Use that are intended by their nature to survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those Sections entitled <a href="#your-soundcloud-account">Your SoundCloud Account</a>, <a href="#your-content">Your Content</a>, <a href="#grant-of-license">Grant of License</a> , <a href="#representations">Representations and Warranties</a>, <a href="#liability-for-content">Liability for Content</a>, <a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>, <a href="#liability-for-content">Limitation of Liability</a>, <a href="#indemnification">Indemnification</a>, <a href="#termination">Termination and Right of Cancellation</a>, <a href="#assignment-to-third-parties">Assignment to Third Parties</a>, <a href="#severability">Severability</a>, <a href="#entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</a>, and <a href="#applicable-law-and-jurisdiction">Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</a>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-to-third-parties">Assignment to third parties</h2>
<p>SoundCloud may assign its rights and (where permissible by law) its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party at any time without notice, including without limitation, to any person or entity acquiring all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud. You may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior written consent of SoundCloud.</p>
<h2 id="severability">Severability</h2>
<p>Should one or more provisions of these Terms of Use be found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision(s) shall be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and/or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h2 id="entire-agreement">Entire agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use, together with the <a href="/en/other/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, Moderation and Enforcement Policy and the Privacy and Cookie Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and SoundCloud with respect to your use of the Platform (other than any use of SoundCloud’s APIs which may also be subject to separate [API Terms of Use]), and supersede any prior agreement between you and SoundCloud. Any modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-rights">Third party rights</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use are not intended to give rights to anyone except you and SoundCloud. This does not affect our right to transfer our rights or obligations to a third party as described in the <a href="#assignment-to-third-parties">Assignment to Third Parties</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="applicable-law-and-jurisdiction">Applicable law and jurisdiction</h2>
<p>Except where otherwise required by the mandatory law of the United States or any member state of the European Union</p>
<p>(i) this Agreement is subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and excluding the principles of conflict of laws (international private law); and</p>
<p>(ii) you hereby agree, and SoundCloud agrees, to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Berlin, Germany for resolution of any dispute, action or proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement.</p>
<p>The foregoing provisions of this Applicable Law and Jurisdiction section do not apply to any claim in which SoundCloud seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by SoundCloud or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against SoundCloud, including with respect to your Content, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms of Use.</p>
