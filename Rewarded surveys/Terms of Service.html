They undertake to keep the nature of the products and concepts discussed during the studies secret. panelists undertake to regularly update their personal information.<br />Members may not assign all or part of these rights and obligations to a third party. The contract is personal and unique and each member has one sole username.<br />Members may sponsor other members but these sponsorships must be carried out in a serious manner. "Cre'Online" reserves the right to permanently disable the account of any member who performs fraudulent sponsorships (non-existent persons etc.) and/or does not comply with the terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Members declare and guarantee that they are perfectly aware of the characteristics and constraints of the Internet, and in particular that the transmission of data and information on the Internet can only benefit from relative technical reliability, as they circulate on heterogeneous networks whose characteristics and technical capacities vary, which disrupts access or makes it impossible at certain periods.</p>
