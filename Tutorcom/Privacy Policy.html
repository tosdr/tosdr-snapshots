				<h1>The Princeton Review and Tutor.com Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><em>Effective Date: June 4, 2024</em></p>
                <p>Tutor.com, Inc. and TPR Education, LLC d/b/a The Princeton Review (collectively, &ldquo;we,&rdquo;
                    &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) take your privacy seriously and understand the importance 
                    of protecting your personal information.  Therefore, this Privacy Policy provides information about
                     our privacy practices. &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; means, unless otherwise defined by 
                     applicable law, any information about, that identifies, that relates to, that is linked to or 
                     associated with, or that is reasonably linkable to or reasonably capable of being associated with 
                     an identified or identifiable individual.  For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not apply to our 
                     employees, job applicants, and independent contractors.</p>
                <p>By visiting this site and other websites and mobile applications which link to this Privacy Policy 
                    (collectively, &ldquo;Sites&rdquo;) or using the products or services offered through this Site, 
                    you agree to this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  This Privacy Policy is 
                    incorporated into the Terms of Use for this Site.</p>
                <p><strong>Availability of Anonymous Access</strong></p>
                <p>Depending on the organization through which you access our online, on-demand tutoring programs, 
                    you can access the program through a guest account, an anonymous account, or a personalized account.</p>
                <p>If you access the program through a guest account, we do not collect personal information such as 
                    your name or email address from you to create an account.  Certain features of the program will 
                    not be available to you, such as voice or videos sessions, essay drop off review, or storage of 
                    past sessions.</p>
                <p>If you access the program through an anonymous account, then the email address you used to create 
                    an individual account is only stored in our system as an un-recognizable &ldquo;hash&rdquo; of 
                    letters and numbers, using an irreversible encryption algorithm. Therefore, you will not receive
                     email communication of any kind from us, and certain features of the program will not be available
                      to you, such as voice or videos sessions and essay drop off review.</p>
                <p>The benefit to a personalized account is to make available certain features of the service like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making your sessions personal;</li>
                    <li>Access to voice and, when generally available, video sessions, and essay drop off review;</li>
                    <li>Storing all of your past sessions, so you can review them anytime; and</li>
                    <li>Access to our mobile application.</li>
                </ul>

                     account with the permission of your parent or legal guardian (obtained by your school or provided 
                     by your school on behalf of your parent or legal guardian if you are using our program through 
                     your school or obtained by us) for us to collect, use, or disclose your personal information in

                    that the person is in fact the child&apos; parent or legal guardian.  </p>
