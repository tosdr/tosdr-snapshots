<h3>14. APPLICABLE LAWS AND ARBITRATION.</h3>
<p>We control and operate the Site and Services from our offices in the United States of America. We do not represent that materials on the Site or Services are appropriate for use in other locations. Persons who choose to access the Site or Services from other locations do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. All parties to these Terms waive their respective rights to a trial by jury. The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Site or Services will be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against us in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against us any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding. The laws of the State of New York will govern these Terms, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, without regard to any conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Regarding claims:</p>
<p>(a) By using the Site or Services, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and us (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/cms-content/ThePrincetonReviewArbitrationProcedures.pdf">Arbitration Procedures&nbsp;</a>.</p>
<p>(b) Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. These Terms, and any dispute between you and us, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<h3>15. TERMINATION.</h3>
<p>We may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Site or the Services at any time. We may restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Site or the Services if we believe you are in breach of these Terms or applicable law, you are a repeat infringer of intellectual property rights, or for any other reason without notice or liability.</p>
<h3>16. CHANGES TO TERMS OF USE.</h3>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify any portion of these Terms at any time. Changes in these Terms will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the Site and/or the Services after any changes to these Terms are posted will be considered acceptance of those changes.</p>
<h3>17. COMMUNICATION.</h3>
<p>If you provide us your email address, you agree and consent to receive email messages from us. These emails may be transactional or relationship communications relating to the products or services we offer, such as administrative notices and service announcements or changes, or emails containing commercial offers, promotions or special offers from us. You also may sign up, and therefore agree, to receive SMS or text messages on your mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>18. MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>
<p>These Terms&nbsp;comprise the entire agreement between you and us concerning the subject matter of these Terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. We may assign these Terms to any person or entity without your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 1, 3-6, 9-14, 17, 18, 20 and any other provisions of these Terms which would be expected to survive the termination or expiration of your relationship with us will so survive.</p>
