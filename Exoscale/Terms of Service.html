on the Website to be bound by these Terms and Conditions) or by
executing the Order and these Terms and Conditions and returning them to
the Supplier by mail, fax or email. The submission of that certain
Order(s) shall constitute an offer to buy the Services. Supplier may
accept that offer at its sole discretion (at which time both Client and
Supplier are legally bound) by way of (i) a message sent via the Website
or by mail, fax or email, thereby acknowledging receipt and acceptance
of the Order; or (ii) delivery of the Services.</p>
<h2 id="3-fees-and-payment-modalities">3. Fees and Payment Modalities</h2>
<h3 id="31-service-fees">3.1 Service Fees</h3>
<p>Supplier shall charge the Services Fees to Client as detailed in the
Order(s). Supplier shall be <em>entitled</em> to increase its Service Fees upon
a forty-five (45) day prior written notice to Client.</p>
<h3 id="32-invoicing-and-payment">3.2 Invoicing and Payment</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing, billing for the
Services shall <em>commence on</em> the Service Commencement Time. Supplier
shall invoice all Service Fees in accordance with the frequency, method,
payment terms and currency set out in the Order and in any case in
advance except for charges that are dependent on usage which shall be
billed in arrears. In the case of period billing any partial period
shall be pro-rated except otherwise noted on order.</p>
<h3 id="33-overdue-charges">3.3 Overdue Charges</h3>
<p>Any amount due but not received by Supplier will accrue interest from
thirty (30) days after the date of invoice to the date of payment at the
Interest Rate (pro-rated on a daily basis). Furthermore, Supplier shall
have the right to set-off any amounts due hereunder which are not paid
when due against any amounts owed to Client by Supplier pursuant to
these Terms and Conditions or any other agreement between the Parties.
In case any amount due is not received by Supplier within sixty (60)
days after the date of invoice, the Supplier shall be entitled to stop
providing the Services to the Client.</p>
<h3 id="34-deposits">3.4 Deposits</h3>
<p>The Client may make a deposit as an advance payment of Service Fees.
Such deposit will be credited on its account for the payment of future
Services. Upon Supplier&rsquo;s request, Client will make a deposit, or other
security for the payment of Service Fees as specified by Supplier, (i)
as a condition to Supplier&rsquo;s acceptance of any Order, or (ii) in the
event Client fails to comply with the payment terms set forth in Section
3.2 twice in any twelve (12) month period, as a condition to Supplier&rsquo;s
continuation of delivery of any Service. The deposit will be held by
Supplier as security for payment of the Service Fees. When Service to
Client is terminated, the amount of the deposit will be credited to
Client&rsquo;s account and <em>any remaining credit balance will be refunded
within thirty (30) days of such termination. Client shall be subject to
the credit limit (&ldquo;</em><em>Credit Limit</em><em>&rdquo;) as may be specified in the
Order(s).</em> The Credit Limit may be varied only with the written approval
of Supplier. Supplier shall have the right at any time to increase or
decrease the Credit Limit by giving at least three (3) days prior
written notice to Client. If at any time Supplier determines that the
sum (&ldquo;<strong>Accrued Liability</strong>&rdquo;) of (i) total invoiced amounts which remain
unpaid, plus (ii) the unbilled but accrued usage of Client, has exceeded
the then current Credit Limit, Supplier shall have the right to demand
by written notice that Client make an immediate payment to Supplier by
electronic transfer (or such other method as agreed by the Parties) of
such amount required: (i) to reduce its aggregate Accrued Liability to
less than the Credit Limit, and (ii) to ensure that the Credit Limit
shall not be exceeded prior to the next invoice due date. Upon such
demand, the demanded amount shall become immediately due and payable and
Client shall pay such amount within twenty-four (24) hours of its
receipt of such notice. If Client fails to remit such payment when due,
Supplier shall have the right without further notice to suspend and/or
terminate the Services.</p>
<h3 id="35-taxes">3.5 Taxes</h3>
<p>All Service Fees are net of taxes. Client will be responsible for
payment of all applicable VAT, duties, sales, use or withholding taxes,
or other similar taxes, fees, or charges whether now or hereafter
enacted, however imposed on or based on the provision, sale or use of
the Services (&ldquo;<strong>Taxes</strong>&rdquo;). If Supplier has the legal obligation to pay
or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible under this Section, the
appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Client, unless
Client provides Supplier with a valid tax exemption certificate
authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>
<h3 id="36-disputed-bills">3.6 Disputed Bills</h3>
<p>In the event Client disputes in good faith any portion of Supplier&rsquo;s
invoice, Client must pay the undisputed portion of the bill and submit a
written claim for the disputed amount documenting the basis of its
claim. All claims must be submitted to Supplier within thirty (30) days
of receipt of billing for those Services. Client waives the right to
dispute the charges not disputed within the time frame set forth above.</p>
<h3 id="37-trial-credit">3.7 Trial Credit</h3>
<p>Trial credit is not redeemable for cash or credit, not transferable and is valid for new accounts only, and limited to one per person. It may not be used in conjunction with other offers or promotions and is issued on a case-by-case evaluation. Trial credit may be billed differently, may vary and be revoked without previous or further notice. Trial value is always based on CHF. When promoted in printed or written forms in other currencies than CHF, as in promotional cards, flyers, digital communications like newsletters, tweets, or any other form of digital or physical communication, the actual credit may vary in function of the exchange rate. During trial period, additional limitations may apply, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
