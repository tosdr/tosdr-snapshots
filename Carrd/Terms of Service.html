2024</p><div class="legal"><section><h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2><p>Carrd Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Carrd", "Company", "we", "us" and "our"), offers you access to <a href="https://carrd.co">carrd.co</a>, an online interactive website builder and hosting platform (the "Website") that allows users to create a website hosted at a subdomain URL using a Carrd domain extension as described in Section 3(D), or a custom domain provided by you (each a "Site").</p><p>This Carrd Terms of Use ("Terms of Use") governs your use of the Website and your access to and use of the products and services we provide (collectively, including the Website, "Service" or "Services").</p><p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW.</p><p>In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> located at <a href="/privacy">https://carrd.co/privacy</a>. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use.</p><p>"You" means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to accept the Agreement on that person's or entity's behalf, that by using our Services you're accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.</p></section><section><h2>2. How the Website Works</h2><ul class="explicit"><li>(A) When using the Website, you agree to follow our guidelines and instructions. Keep in mind that these Terms of Use apply to any use of the Website and any of our products and services (collectively, "Products") whether or not you publish your Site.</li><li>(B) In order to publish your Site, you will have to become a registered user. You need to be 18 years or older to register. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use our products and services, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you are permitted to use our Products or are permitted to publish a Site, with or without registering, unless only with approval of your parent or guardian.</li><li>(C) If you become a registered user, you will provide true, accurate and complete registration information and, if such information changes, you will promptly update the relevant registration information. During registration, you will create a user name and password (an "Account"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing our Products. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</li><li>(D) Becoming a registered user will provide you with a Basic plan, which is 100% free and provides access to use most of the Website Services.</li><li><p>(E) Upon becoming a registered user, you will be prompted to fund your account or purchase virtual cash or credits through PayPal or a credit/debit card that can be used to purchase certain Services or Service features from us. All amounts you pay to purchase virtual cash or credits will become the exclusive property of Carrd. Your virtual cash or credits will be made available to you as an "account balance" that can be used to purchase, renew or upgrade to a Pro Lite plan, a Pro Standard plan, a Pro Plus plan, or some variant thereof ("Pro plan"), which provides some additional features that are not available with our Basic plan. Optionally, the Pro plan may also be automatically renewed on an annual basis and remain in effect until cancelled by you. Virtual cash or credits have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash, transferred to a third party, or to make purchases from any other party. By authorizing a purchase through PayPal or a credit/debit card, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your state) and are authorized to use the payment method you present for the requested transaction. <p>In addition, fees may be charged by us for access to and use of Services. Such fees (and any associated payment terms, including invoicing) may be detailed on our platform or notified by us to you from time to time. Fees are quoted by us exclusive of value added tax or any equivalent sales tax. All fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes for which you shall be additionally liable at the applicable rates from time to time. If there is a change in the rate of tax payable, in the tax treatment of the platform or Services, a change of law or practice or interpretation of the existing legislation or revised determination by any tax authority, the supply of the Services by us has been incorrectly regarded as tax exempt or if the courts rule tax is chargeable, then, where tax is imposed on a supply by us under or in connection with these Terms (including the retrospective application of tax upon services which we have already performed and which have previously been invoiced on a tax exempt basis), you shall pay to us on demand a sum equal to the amount of the tax which becomes due on that supply and any fees and/or interest which any tax authority levies on us in relation to the outstanding sums and/or non-payment.</p></li><li>(F) If you have insufficient funds in your account balance to perform an upgrade or manual renewal, you will be prompted to pay for the difference using either PayPal or a credit/debit card to add to your account balance. Optionally, you may add a saved payment method (e.g. a credit card) to replenish your account balance or to automatically cover charges in excess of your account balance. If you have insufficient funds in your account balance to perform an automatic renewal and you do not have a saved payment method, your account will, after a short grace period, be automatically downgraded to the free Basic plan and your sites will lose access to any Pro features they may be using. Saved payment methods are stored remotely by our third-party payment providers, and balances are stored in US dollars.</li><li>(G) You may optionally apply referral codes to upgrades and manual renewals. In the case of upgrades, a referral code's discount will be applied after any other credits you receive (e.g. a prorated credit for time remaining on an existing Pro plan).</li><li>(H) You may, during the course of your Pro plan, upgrade or downgrade to a different Pro plan. If upgrading to a higher cost Pro plan, you may be prompted to pay for the difference (after any applicable credits) in the manner described in Section 2(F). If downgrading to a lower cost Pro plan, a prorated credit for the time remaining on your existing Pro plan will be added to your account balance. Upon request, we may then, in our sole discretion, grant a full or partial refund of this credit to the original funding payment.</li><li>(I) Excluding earnings from Carrd itself (e.g. our referral program, as described in Section 7) and refunds which shall be granted in our sole discretion, balances cannot be withdrawn; once funds have been deposited in your account, they can only be used to purchase Products. Except for any sales tax that we may be required to collect on any purchase by you, you are responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with your use of the Website, if any.</li><li>(J) Account balances are the exclusive property of Carrd and do not earn interest. We do not generally offer return of funds or credits on purchases unless required by law, but we reserve the right to do so in our sole and absolute discretion.</li><li>(K) In using our Service you may purchase (alternatively, you may earn virtual cash or credits through use of our Services), using either PayPal or a credit/debit card or your account balance, a limited, non-sublicensable, revocable right to use (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual cash or credits, for your use with our Services; (b) virtual in-application items, content or features, including template designs; and (c) other goods or services ((a) through (c), collectively "Virtual Items"). You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service, and not in any other way. You must be 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your state), or obtain permission from your parent or legal guardian to purchase Virtual Items.</li><li>(L) Carrd may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice, however, your Virtual Items may not expire from 5 years from the date of purchase. Carrd shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Carrd exercises any such rights.</li><li>(M) The use or transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the Service. Other than as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity or attempt any of the aforesaid, including but not limited to Carrd, another user or any third party.</li><li>(N) ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</li><li>(O) The provision of Virtual Items is strictly for your personal, non-commercial use in connection with your use of the Service.

All Virtual Items must be sold via the Carrd Service and must comply with Carrd’s User Content policy as described in Section 5 of these Terms of Use.

Agreement to Arbitrate</h2><p>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:</p><p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p><ul class="explicit"><li>(A) Agreement to Arbitrate: This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Company, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Website, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</li><li>(B) Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief: YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</li><li>(C) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at <a href="/contact">https://carrd.co/contact</a>. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Company should be sent to Carrd Inc., 231 Public Square Suite 300 PMB 12, Franklin, TN 37064 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Company and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.</li><li>(D) Arbitration Procedures: Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a target="_blank" href="https://adr.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://adr.org</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, <a target="_blank" href="https://adr.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://adr.org</a> as may be updated from time to time. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li><li>(E) Costs of Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</li><li>(F) Confidentiality: All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</li><li>(G) Severability: If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (B) titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (B) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.</li><li>(H) Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement: Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</li></ul></section><section><h2>12.
