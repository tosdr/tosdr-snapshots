Through this Service and links to other web sites, Eargo provides general healthcare information for educational and informative purposes only and is not a healthcare provider. The information provided on this Service (including under the “Do I Need A Hearing Device” section and in any doctor testimonials), or through links to other web sites, or by employees, agents or representatives of Eargo on or off this Service, by chat, email, telephone, in person or through any other form of communication, is not a substitute for medical or professional care, and you should not use the information in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of your physician or other healthcare provider. More specifically, the Success Screening given during checkout is not a medical diagnosis of your hearing ability. Eargo is not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information or product you obtain through this Service. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL 911 OR YOUR PHYSICIAN. Never rely on information on this Service in place of seeking professional medical advice. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this Service. You should also ask your physician or other healthcare provider to assist you in interpreting any information on this Service or on any linked web sites, or in applying the information to your individual case. Medical information changes constantly. Therefore the information on this Service or on any linked web sites should not be considered current, complete or exhaustive, nor should you rely on such information to recommend a course of treatment for you or any other individual. Eargo does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Service. Reliance on any information provided on this Service is solely at your own risk.</p>\r\n<p><b>ORDERS/PAYMENT TERMS</b><br>\r\nThe Service provides you with the ability to submit orders for products and services (“Order(s)”) and you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Order including, without limitation, your credit card or debit card number and expiration date, your billing address and your shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR DEBIT CARD(S) OR CHECKING ACCOUNTS OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) USED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION, AND THAT ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ANY FINANCING APPLICATION IS TRUTHFUL AND CORRECT. By submitting such information, you grant to Eargo the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Orders initiated by you or on your behalf. We may require verification of information prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Order. It is your responsibility to ascertain and comply with all applicable laws with regard to the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from this Service. Eargo reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any Order for any reason. An Order may not be fulfilled if you are located outside the Service’s authorized shipping area. Excluded territories may change at any time at Eargo’s discretion.</p>\r\n<p>You agree to pay all charges that may be incurred by you or on your behalf in connection with all Orders placed through the Service, at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred including, without limitation, all shipping and handling charges. In addition, you are responsible for any applicable taxes in connection with your Order.</p>\r\n<p>We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process. Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the products to the carrier. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.</p>\r\n<p>You are solely responsible for your payment information and any other content you submit on or through the Service in connection with your Order (collectively, the “Payment Information”). We have the right but not the obligation to decline all or any portion of any Payment Information for any reason or no reason.</p>\r\n<p>We describe our merchandise and include pictures and photographs on our Services, but sometimes the product varies slightly from the picture or description due to changes made by our manufacturers, and we are not liable for these nonmaterial changes. All descriptions, images, references, content, specifications, products, and prices of products described or depicted on the Service are subject to change at any time without notice. The inclusion of any products on this Service at a particular time does not guarantee that such products will be available.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the Service may include inaccuracies or errors including pricing errors. Eargo reserves the right to correct any pricing errors on the Service and/or pending Orders made under an incorrect price. In such event, if available, Eargo will offer you the opportunity to keep your pending Order at the correct price or Eargo will cancel your Order without penalty.</p>\r\n<p>To place an Order, you must be over 18 years old, and entitled to purchase a hearing aid device.</p>\r\n<p><b>RESELLING PRODUCTS PROHIBITED</b><br>\r\nYou may not, under any circumstances, resell any products you purchase from or through Eargo, whether or not you purchased the products through the Service.

We will only process returns for hearing aid devices purchased directly from Eargo.</p>\r\n<p><b>45 DAY RIGHT TO RETURN</b><br>\r\nIf you are not satisfied with your Eargo® hearing aid device or any unopened accessory (the “Device”), you have the option of returning the Device within forty-five (45) days after delivery. As long as the Device is in its original condition (unopened, in the case of an accessory) and has not been damaged or modified (including repaired without our prior written consent) in any way, we will credit back the purchase price to the account used at the time of purchase, less any expedited shipping if any. If the Device returned to us is damaged in any way, you will not receive a refund.</p>\r\n<p>Refunds are processed within approximately five (5) business days of our receipt of your Device. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original purchase on the Service. WE OFFER NO REFUNDS ON ANY PRODUCTS DESIGNATED ON THIS SITE AS NON-RETURNABLE.</p>\r\n<p><b>WARRANTY, REPAIR, AND LOSS AND DAMAGE POLICIES</b><br>\r\nPlease visit <a title=\&quot;link to Eargo's warranty policy page\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.eargo.com/warranty\&quot;>eargo.com/warranty</a> for current Eargo warranty, repair, and loss and damage policies.</p>\r\n<p><b>AUTHORIZED USE OF SERVICE:</b>&amp;nbsp;This Service is provided for your personal use only.
