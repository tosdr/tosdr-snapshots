Following are our uses of required cookies:<ul>\r\n<li>Authenticate and Sign You In: When you sign into one of our web sites, we store the time you sign in and a unique ID number in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within our web sites without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information, so you do not have to sign in each time you return to our web sites.</li>\r\n<li>Security: We use cookies to detect fraud and abuse of our web sites and services.</li>\r\n<li>Store Information You Provide to a Web Site: When you provide information or add applications, products, software or services to a shopping cart when shopping on our web sites, we store data in a cookie to remember the products and information you have added and/or your interactions with us online.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<br>\r\n<li><b>Functional Cookies:</b>&amp;nbsp;These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the site to evaluate and improve our performance.

Note that if you decline them, some important web site functionality that relies on these cookies may not be available to you. Following are functional cookie uses:<ul>\r\n<li>Perform Analytics: To provide our products, software and services, we use cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data, and to help optimize performance of our web sites.
