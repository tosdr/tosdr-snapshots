<p><strong>Bing Conversion Tracking</strong></p>
<p>This website uses Google Conversion Tracking. The provider of this service is Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Google Conversion Tracking we are in a position to recognize whether the user has completed certain actions. For instance, we can analyze the how frequently which buttons on our website have been clicked and which products are reviewed or purchased with particular frequency. The purpose of this information is to compile conversion statistics. We learn how many users have clicked on our ads and which actions they have completed. We do not receive any information that would allow us to personally identify the users. Google as such uses cookies or comparable recognition technologies for identification purposes.</p>
<p>We use Google Conversion Tracking on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. et seq. GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the analysis of the user patterns with the aim of optimizing both, the operator&rsquo;s web presentation and advertising. If a respective declaration of consent was requested (e.g. concerning the storage of cookies), processing shall occur exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR; the given consent may be revoked at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Kibana</strong></p>
<p>Our website uses Kibana to analyse users. Kibana is a proprietary tracking tool that we use to record what keywords a user searches for, what browser they use and what cookie ID a user has. The cookie-ID is used to uniquely recognise the user and to be able to connect user data. On the Internet, every device requires a unique address, the so-called IP address, to transmit data. Due to the way the Internet works, it is technically necessary to store the IP address at least temporarily.</p>
<p>The IP addresses are shortened by 1 byte before any processing and are only processed further in an anonymised form. There is no saving or further processing of the unabridged IP addresses. Tracking with Kibana is carried out with justified interest in accordance with Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. et seq. GDPR. The purpose of the processing of personal data is the compilation of statistics. The statistics serve to be able to track and document the use of our offer.</p>
