        <h2>I. GENERAL</h2>
        <p>Subject Well, Inc. and its group entities ("SubjectWell", "we", or "us") offer clinical trial participant recruitment services (the "Services"). This
            Privacy Policy sets out how we use and protect your Personal Information and your rights and choices with regard to that information. This Privacy
            Policy applies to Personal Information collected by or on behalf of SubjectWell, including information collected through our websites:
            <a href="https://alzheimers-study.org" target="_blank">https://alzheimers-study.org</a>; <a href="https://breastcancerclinicaltrial.org" target="_blank">https://breastcancerclinicaltrial.org</a>;

            <a href="https://osteoarthritistrials.org" target="_blank">https://osteoarthritistrials.org</a> and mobile versions of our websites (collectively "the Site") or anywhere else we display this Privacy Policy.
            It also applies to information collected by or through our Services, which may include by phone, text message, email, the Site or other communication
            mechanisms.</p>
        <p>To the extent you are a parent, guardian, caretaker or other authorized representative of another individual (such as a minor) and register for the Services on
            that person's behalf, you represent that you are legally authorized to take such actions and to disclose the individual's Personal Information. In such case,
            statements in this Privacy Policy directed to registered users of the Services apply to the person whose Personal Information you provided.</p>
        <p>By visiting the Site or using the Services, you accept and consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your visit or use.</p>
        <h2>II. WHAT WE MEAN BY "PERSONAL INFORMATION"</h2>
        <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means information that directly or indirectly identifies you or can be used to identify you as an individual.</p>
        <h2>III. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
        <h3>(1) Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>When you use the Site or otherwise communicate or interact with us through the Services, we collect information that you provide to us directly. For example, we collect
            information in the following circumstances: when you contact us; when you register for and engage with our Services; and when you otherwise communicate with us.
            Occasionally, you may choose whether to provide or disclose Personal Information in connection with your use of the Services. If you choose not to provide the Personal
            Information we request, you may still visit and use parts of the Site, but may be unable to access or use certain features, options, programs, and services of the Site.
            In addition, as we need certain Personal Information for the performance of the Services, the consequence of not providing such information might be that the Services
            cannot be provided as requested.</p>
        <p>The Personal Information you provide to us may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information you provide via email, through our 'Contact' section, or using contact details listed on various parts of the Site, including your name, e-mail,
                phone number, and any other information you decide to provide;</li>
            <li>In connection with the Services, information you provide  to sign up for clinical trial matching, including your name, age, e-mail address, health conditions
                relevant to the clinical trial opportunities, or any other information you decide to provide to us in connection with the Services; and</li>
            <li>We may also collect any other information you may want to share with us. Moreover, if you contact us, a record of such correspondence may be kept.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A subset of personal information we may collect is “sensitive personal information,” as defined by applicable law, and includes health conditions and other medical record
            information relevant to the clinical trial opportunities.  The business or commercial purpose for which it is collected is for our operational purposes and performing
            services you request.  When applicable, we will obtain your consent or authorization before accessing such information, in accordance with applicable law. </p>
        <p>In addition, when you decide to participate in a clinical trial, then any information you provide as a participant in that trial is subject to the informed consent form
            that you complete.</p>
        <h3>(2) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>Certain information is collected automatically on the Site by means of various software tools. We have a legitimate interest in using such information to assist in log-in,
            systems administration purposes, information security and abuse prevention, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of the Site. Alone or in combination
            with other information, such automatically collected information may constitute Personal Information. Some of our service providers (described in Section V., below) may
            use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Site and to track your activities over time and across sites to provide advertising services to us.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log Files On the Site. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ("IP") addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), date/time
                stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and other information your browser may send to us about your use of the Site.</li>
            <li>Cookies. We use cookies to make interactions with the Site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our servers may send a cookie to your computer. We may use
                cookies that are session-based and persistent. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software
                or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your web
                browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Site, but you may not be able to use all the features of the Site. The following sets out how we
                may use different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookie settings:</li>

                    We sometimes use cookies delivered by service providers to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the
                    Site. By way of example, as you browse the Site, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our advertising
                    partners then enable us to present you with advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with the Site. Service providers, with whom we partner to provide
                    certain features on the Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are
                    different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.

            <li>Analytics. The Site also uses Google Analytics. By using cookies, Google Analytics collects and stores data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each
                page of the Site, the IP address, and the type of operating system used in the devices used to access the Site. By using a browser plugin available at

        </ul>
        <h3>(3) Do-Not-Track Signals</h3>
        <p>Some browsers have a "Do-Not-Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. When you choose to turn on the Do-Not-Track
            setting in your browser, your browser sends a signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services that you may encounter while
            browsing the Internet, instructing them to stop tracking your activity via cookies or other online tracking technologies. While we continue to evaluate this evolving
            technology to implement such capabilities, the Site does not currently respond to browser-based Do-Not-Track signals. For information regarding Do-Not-Track and how to
            enable this setting if available on your devices, please see <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">https://allaboutdnt.com</a>. </p>
        <h3>(4) Information Received from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may also obtain data from third-party sources such as a registrant's authorized representative or guardian, our customers or vendors such as data providers.</p>
        <h2>IV. PURPOSES FOR OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <h3>(1) General Uses</h3>
        <p>We may use Personal Information obtained through the Services in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the Services;</li>
            <li>To provide, analyze, administer, develop, and improve the Site or our Services;</li>
            <li>To contact you in connection with the Site, our Services, and notifications, services, programs or offerings for which you may have registered;</li>
            <li>To send you updates and promotional materials for which you have registered;</li>
            <li>To assess whether a clinical trial is suited for you, to contact you when a potential clinical trial is identified, and to bring you in contact with principal
                investigators, clinical research sites or clinical trial service providers, using solely for these purposes the health information that is provided to us based on
                your consent;</li>
            <li>To contact you regarding other treatment options, refer you to other trial sites and other related purposes;</li>
            <li>To identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Site and Services that you are authorized to access;</li>
            <li>For our legitimate interests of documenting and managing our internal administration;</li>
            <li>To protect the rights and/or our property and to ensure the technical functionality and security of the Site or Services; and</li>
            <li>To comply with applicable laws and for our legitimate purposes of protecting our legal rights, in connection with legal claims or enforcement of contracts, and for
                compliance, regulatory, and investigative purposes. This may include sharing the Personal Information with third parties, such as governmental authorities or law
                enforcement officials, subject to applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>(2) Registered Users</h3>
        <p>If you register for our Services, SubjectWell uses algorithms that enforce criteria to select the clinical trial most suitable to you, which is the service that you
            (as the data subject) request from SubjectWell. The decision on the clinical trial matching is therefore necessary for the performance of the contract between you and
            SubjectWell. Furthermore, our patient recruitment marketplace is voluntary and when you choose to participate and disclose your information to us, you also provide your
            explicit consent, which is freely given and can be withdrawn at any time by contacting us through the contact details further below.</p>
        <p>The logic that is used for the decision-making is created by SubjectWell employees reviewing study protocols that define inclusion/exclusion criteria for study eligibility.
            The SubjectWell systems then enforce these criteria based on the responses collected during the phone screening process. The most important consequences of the automated
            decisions in question are that you will or will not have the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial. </p>
        <p>To safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, you have the right to obtain human intervention on the part of SubjectWell, to express your point of view
            and to contest the decision.</p>
        <p>Also note that we only provide clinical trial participant recruitment services and are not involved in clinical trials or informed about the results. Therefore, SubjectWell
            does not determine the purposes or means of the further processing of your Personal Information, including your health information, by principal investigators, clinical
            research sites or clinical trial service providers once you are brought in contact with them. </p>
        <h2>V. WHO DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?</h2>
        <p>We may disclose Personal Information you provide to us or that we collect automatically on the Site or in and through the Services with the following categories of third parties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service providers, such as data storage service providers, marketing service providers, and communications service providers that help us operate our business or provide
                services on our behalf;</li>
            <li>If you would like to participate in a clinical trial and there are matching clinical trials, we may share Personal Information about you with principal investigators,
                clinical research sites, and clinical trial service providers that are relevant to you; </li>
            <li>If you are matched to a clinical trial, your Personal Information may be de-identified/pseudonymized/ anonymized and shared with sponsors of the potentially matching
                clinical studies.</li>
            <li>Public authorities, such as law enforcement, if we are legally required to do so or if we need to for national security or to protect our rights or the rights of third
                parties; </li>
            <li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates for our business operations; and</li>
            <li>A subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially
                all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>VI. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES</h2>
        <p>Once you register for our Services, if you have opted-in to certain communications, you may be contacted at the phone number you provide including wireless number
            (if provided), by a representative of SubjectWell or its database administrator. You may opt out of these calls or texts at any time by sending an email to
            <a href="mailto:privacy@subjectwell.com">privacy@subjectwell.com</a> or by calling (844) 612-6317. If you would like to stop receiving text messages, you may text STOP in
            reply to any messages that you receive.</p>
        <p>With your consent (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law) we use the Personal Information you provide us to send you information on our products and Services and other
            information based on the interests that you have indicated to us. You have the right to opt out of getting those messages. If you do not wish to receive these messages,
            click the unsubscribe link in your email. Please note that these selections are not permanent; they may be changed in the event you register for other Services or
            communications and consent to receive marketing messages. Please also note that even if you unsubscribe from commercial email messages, we may still email you
            non-marketing emails related to your account or the Services for which you have registered. You may also email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@subjectwell.com">privacy@subjectwell.com</a> for assistance.</p>
        <h2>VII. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</h2>
        <p>The Site may contain links to other sites, which are not owned or operated by us or our affiliates. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link
            on the Site does not imply our endorsement of the linked site. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. If you provide any Personal Information through a third-party
            website, your transaction will occur on such third party's website (not our Site) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy
            policy of, that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites, including such websites' use of any Personal
            Information that you provide to them.</p>
        <h2>VIII. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
        <p>The information in this section applies to residents of California. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@subjectwell.com">privacy@subjectwell.com</a> if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy,
            including this section specific to California residents, or if you would like a printed copy of this Privacy Policy. You may also print a copy of this Privacy Policy
            by selecting the "Print" button in your web browser.</p>

            Information we collected about California residents in the last 12 months, the sources of that information, our business or commercial purposes for collecting the information,

        <p>We collected the information listed in the table below from the following sources: directly from you, your authorized personal representative, or from third parties (such as
