Subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Orpheus Technology, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of the use of the Services by Subscriber or Subscriber's account.  </p>

<h2>14. Lifetime license</h2>

<p>14.1 A "Lifetime License" shall mean a License for the use of Paid Services granted to you by Orpheus with the proviso that it shall only terminate a) upon the end of your life, or b) if Orpheus ceases to provide the Services in their entirety, or c) if Orpheus ceases its business operations in their entirety. A Lifetime License is granted to you personally and the rights and obligations associated therewith shall not pass to your heirs. Orpheus may ask you to present proof of identification at any time.</p>

<p>14.2 Under any Order concluded for the granting of a Lifetime License, you are entitled to access the Service(s) agreed in such Order for as long as the respective Service(s) is/are offered and supported by Orpheus ("Lifetime License Term").</p>

<p>14.3 A Lifetime License shall only apply to Services defined in the applicable Order and shall not extend to any alternative or future services.</p>

<p>14.4 With regard to updates and modifications of Services under a Lifetime License, Clause 2.2 applies.</p>

<p>14.5 Neither Orpheus nor you may terminate any Order for a Lifetime License for convenience. Your and Orpheus’s right to immediately terminate any Order for a Lifetime License for good cause in accordance with Clause 11.4 shall remain unaffected.</p>

<h2>15. Referral program</h2>

<p>15.1 To qualify for a free license through our referral program ("Referral License"), you must refer only valid customers ("Referred Customers"). We employ automated monitoring mechanisms to ensure that Referred Customers are only counted if they actually use the product. ProWritingAid reserves the right to review, investigate, and disqualify any Referral License that violates the Referral Program, such as attempting to gain a Referral License through self-referral, by using a different email address, or any other mechanism that is against the spirit of the Referral Program. </p>
