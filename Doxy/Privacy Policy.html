Some features are not activated automatically and require explicit authorization by You.</p><p><strong>What Personal Data Do We Collect? </strong></p><p>The Personal Data that We collect from You depends on how You interact with Us, the Websites, and the Services. The following includes the categories and types of Personal Data We have collected from Providers within the last twelve (12) months: </p><ul><li>Identifiers:<br/> o Email address; <br/>o Name; <br/>o Phone number;* </li><li>Professional/non-public education information: <br/>o Specialty;*<br/> o Position or title;*<br/> o National Provider Identifier (NPI);* <br/>o States licensed to practice;* </li><li>Commercial Information: <br/>o Country and payment details; ** <br/>o Records of the Services Purchased or Used; and </li><li>Internet Activity: <br/>o Usage Data such as browsing history and search history on the Website. </li><li>Content Not Directed At the Business, which may include Sensitive Personal Data that <br/>your Patients or you provide: <br/>o Photocapture and file exchange features are collected and transmitted through Our servers and promptly deleted after 15 minutes (see disclosure below). <br/><em>* This information is optional. </em><br/><em>** Only required if using Stripe payment services; this information is not stored in the Service. </em><br/>In addition, to the extent that You have visited Our Site as a Guest, We have also collected the Personal Data as stated under the subheading “If You Are Browsing This Website As a Guest”. </li></ul><p><strong>What Personal Data do We intentionally NOT Collect? </strong></p><p>Although the Doxy.me Services are targeted to the healthcare community, Doxy.me does not collect or store any health or sensitive information You discuss during the video conference between Patient and Provider. Any health or other sensitive information You discuss or share with Your Patient is encrypted over a secure channel using the HTTPS Internet protocol with TLS encryption. Doxy.me cannot view or store the audio-video component of the Session. Even though We cannot view or store the audio-video component of the Session, there are some important privacy considerations You should be aware of that We list below, including that file transfers and photo captured during a Session are captured and stored for a transitory period on Our servers as further described below. </p><h4><strong>Session Information </strong></h4><p><strong>Screenshare </strong></p><p>The Services provide a feature whereby You may share all or part of Your computer screen with the Patient or You may request to view the Patient’s screen. </p><p>There are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen. It is up to You to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than that which the Patient is allowed to see) is viewable during the screensharing session. </p><p>Conversely, it is up to the Patient to ensure that there is no sensitive or confidential information on their screen prior to agreeing to the screenshare.</p><p>Doxy.me cannot control and is not in possession of any Personal Data You or the Patient might share when using screenshare. </p><p><strong>Chats </strong></p><p>Any chats between You and the Patient are temporarily stored in Your computer memory, not on Doxy.me servers. Your chat history stays after the Session ends so You may copy to an internal system. Once the browser is closed, the chat history is permanently deleted. </p><p><strong>Session Privacy </strong></p><p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both. Doing so may prevent effective communication with the Patient. However, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons. </p><p>You may terminate the Session at any time. </p><p><strong>Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form </strong></p><p>You may ask or require a Patient to sign a Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form through our Service. The purpose of the form is to convey what telehealth communication is, Patient rights, and obligations for each party. Doxy.me provides a template form or, depending on Your Account type, You may upload Your own form. It is Your obligation to ensure that Your Patient has provided all necessary consents to use the Service, including any consents required by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) with respect to any protected health information (PHI) as defined therein, as applicable to you, including, but not limited to, the Services and any file transfer or photo capture services you elect to use. </p><p>After the Patient signs the form, it should be downloaded by both You and Your Patient as it is not stored by the Services and will be permanently deleted once signed. </p><p><strong>Telehealth Tools </strong></p><p>Telehealth Tools are additional features, apps, or tools from Affiliates and/or third party Service Providers that may be used by a Provider during the Services. Such use is completely optional and may involve an additional fee. These Telehealth Tools may collect additional Personal Data (including PHI) during a Session, which Doxy.me does not access, view, collect, transmit, or store. The Affiliates and Service Providers that provide Telehealth Tools have their own terms of use and privacy policies that should be reviewed by You and the Patient prior to use. If You would like to use additional Telehealth Tools during a Session with a Patient, You must obtain consent from the Patient prior to use of each additional Telehealth Tool, and if you are required to have a business associate agreement (“BAA”) with the Affiliate to use the Telehealth Tool, procurement of such BAA is your responsibility. </p><p><strong>Your Waiting Room </strong></p><p>You can change the look and feel of Your Waiting Room and add Your content. We do not monitor the content in Your Waiting Room. You are expressly liable for the content of Your waiting room. </p><h4><strong>What Personal Data Do We or our Service Providers collect, securely transmit, and delete? </strong></h4><p><strong>Invitations </strong></p><p>You may invite Patients to Sessions by the following methods: </p><ul><li>Email sent by the Service via a third-party Service Provider </li><li>Email sent by Your computer or smartphone email system </li><li>Mobile text message via a third-party Service Provider </li><li>Calendar </li></ul><p>Any information You enter into the invitation sent by the Services will be used to create and send the message. Once that task is completed, the information is no longer used and will be permanently deleted by the service provider in the ordinary course. </p><p><strong>File Transfer</strong></p><p>If You choose to send a file to the Patient, that file is transmitted through Our server and is stored by Us until it is automatically deleted from Our server fifteen (15) minutes after the transfer completes. Conversely, if a Patient sends You a file, that file is transmitted through and stored on Our server until it is automatically deleted fifteen (15) minutes after the transfer completes. You are responsible for downloading and retaining any files transferred through the Service. After automatic deletion, We will have no ability to access the files that were transferred.

This is called Single Sign-On (SSO) and means that You must first authenticate to that third-party identity provider prior to accessing the Service. Facebook and Google identity connectors are built into the Services for the You to optionally use. Also, Doxy.me offers a custom feature whereby You may specify Your own SSO service. </p><p>By using SSO, You will be transferred to an authentication agent for that particular identity provider where Your login credentials (usually a name and password) are used to verify Your identity. Doxy.me does not have access to credentials used by a third-party identity provider. Once You have authenticated via SSO, a token is returned to Us indicating that Your identity has been verified and You will be granted access to the Service. </p><p><strong>Patient Payment Information</strong></p><p>If You choose to ask the Patient to pay You during the Session, You may use the third-party Stripe credit card payment system. Prior to requesting payment, You must setup a Stripe account in the settings section of Your Account. The Patient will receive a payment pop-up screen asking to provide their name and credit card details. All credit card transactions are handled by Stripe. Doxy.me does not capture or utilize any information entered in the payment pop-up screen. For more information, please visit <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/</a>. </p><p><strong>Services Payment Information </strong></p><p>If You choose to have a paid subscription, payment is made using the Stripe third-party credit card payment system. All credit card transactions are handled by Stripe. Doxy.me receives a notification from Stripe when the transaction is completed, but no PHI is exchanged. For more information, please visit <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/</a>. </p><h4><strong>If You are a Patient </strong></h4><p>This section only applies if You have received a Provider Link (such as https://doxy.me/DrSmith2024) by a Provider and wish to communicate with the Provider by video conference using the Service. Some features are not activated automatically and require explicit authorization by You. </p><p><strong>What Personal Data Do We Collect? </strong></p><p>The Personal Data that We collect from You depends on how You interact with Us, the Websites, and the Services. The following includes the categories and types of Personal Data We have collected from Patients within the last twelve (12) months: </p><ul><li>Identifiers:<br/>o Name*; <br/>o Email Address**; and <br/>o Telephone Number** </li><li>Content not Directed at the Business, which may include Sensitive Personal Data that you provide: <br/>o Photo capture and file exchange features are collected and transmitted through Our servers (see disclosure below) *** </li><li>Internet Activity:<br/> o Usage Data such as history of access to the Website. <br/><em>* User name entered by You to enter the Services.<br/> ** Collected if your Provider has opted to use these to notify you. </em><br/><em>*** Collected and transmitted through Our servers and promptly deleted as described herein. We have no control over the Personal Data exchanged through this method. </em></li></ul><p>A Patient does not create an Account or register with Doxy.me in order to use the Services. A Provider will email or text You a Provider Link in order to enter the Waiting room. When You click on that link, it will take You to the welcome screen and You will be asked to enter Your name and click a “Check In” button. Your name is only seen by the Provider and used for an initial identification. There is no verification of Your name nor is there a requirement that You use Your full name. Your name is used only for the current Session and is not stored or otherwise used by the Service. If Your Provider has used Our Services to text or email Your invitation, then We will have sent certain information to a third-party for transmission for which Your data will be permanently deleted by the vendor in the ordinary course. If You have called us, chatted with us, or emailed Us for customer support, We will have a record of this Communication. </p><p>In addition, to the extent that You have visited Our Site as a Guest or reached us through customer support, We have also collected the Personal Data as stated under the subheading “If You Are Browsing This Website As a Guest.” </p><h4><strong>What Personal Data Do We intentionally NOT Collect or Retain? </strong></h4><p>Although the Doxy.me Services are targeted to the healthcare community, Doxy.me does not collect or store any health or other sensitive information You discuss during the Session between Patient and Provider. Any health or other sensitive information You discuss or send the Provider is sent over a secure channel using the SSL Internet protocol. Even though We cannot view or store the audio-video component of the Session, there are some important privacy considerations You should be aware of that We list below, including that file transfers and photo captured during a Session are captured and stored for a transitory period on Our servers as further described below. </p><h4><strong>Session Information </strong></h4><p><strong>Screenshare </strong></p><p>The Services provide a feature whereby the Provider may request to view Your screen or the Provider may share his/her/their screen with You. </p><p>There are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen. It is up to You to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information is viewable during the screensharing session outside of the Personal Data that You choose to share with the Provider. </p><p>Doxy.me cannot control and is not in possession of any Personal Data You or the Provider might share when using screenshare. </p><p><strong>Chats </strong></p><p>Any chats between You and the Provider are temporarily stored in computer memory, not on Doxy.me servers. Once the browser is closed, the chat history is permanently deleted. </p><p><strong>Session Privacy </strong></p><p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both. Doing so may prevent effective communication with the Provider. However, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons. </p><p>You may also terminate the Session at any time. </p><p><strong>Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form </strong></p><p>Your Provider may ask You to sign a Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form. The purpose of the form is to inform You of what telehealth communication is as well as Your rights and obligations. You should read the form completely and not hesitate to ask Your Provider for any clarifications. </p><p>If You are required to sign the form, Your signature will be electronically captured by using Your mouse and be embedded in the form. The form may be downloaded by both You and Your Provider and is not stored by the Service. </p><p><strong>Telehealth Tools </strong></p><p>Telehealth Tools are additional features, apps, or tools from Affiliates and/or Service Providers that may be used by a Provider during or separate from a Session. Such use is completely optional and determined by the Provider. These Telehealth Tools may collect additional Personal Data (including PHI) which Doxy.me does not access, view, collect, transmit, or store. </p><p>The Affiliates and Service Providers that provide Telehealth Tools have their own terms of use and privacy policies that should be reviewed by You prior to use. </p><h4><strong>What Personal Data Do We collect, securely transmit, and delete? </strong></h4><p><strong>File Transfer </strong></p><p>If You choose to send a file to the Provider, that file is transmitted through and stored on Our server until it is automatically deleted from Our server fifteen (15) minutes after the transfer is complete. You are in control of the Personal Data that you submit to the Provider. </p><p><strong>Photo Capture </strong></p><p>If Your Provider chooses to capture a photo of You, that image will be sent securely and that image will be transmitted through and stored on Our server until it is destroyed fifteen (15) minutes after the transfer completes. You are in control of the Personal Data that you submit to the Provider. </p><p><strong>Invitations </strong></p><p>If Your Provider has elected to use the Services to send Provider Links to You, We may collect Your name, email address, or telephone number to do so. Any such information uploaded by the Provider will be used to create and send the Provider Link. Once that task is completed, the Personal Data will be permanently deleted a short period after the transfer is complete. </p><h4><strong>How Do We Collect Personal Data? </strong></h4><p>We collect Personal Data: </p><ul><li>Directly from You when You contact Us for information about the Services or the Website, including from customer service. </li><li>From Your Provider including your name, email address and telephone number if the Provider uses Our Services to send the Provider Link to You. </li><li>From Service Providers if Your Provider uses Our billing services or records of transaction history (not including credit card numbers or PHI). </li><li>Automatically, through Usage Data we collect from usage of the waiting room </li></ul><h4><strong>How and why Do We Use Your Personal Data? </strong></h4><p>The Personal Data shall be collected for the business purpose of identifying You to the Provider using the Services and to assure full operation of the Services during all Sessions. </p><p>The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes: </p><ul><li><strong>To provide and maintain Our Service</strong>, including to monitor the usage of Our Services. </li><li><strong>To notify You: </strong>If Your Provider enables email notifications within the Services, We will send You an email notifying You when it is time for Your appointment.
