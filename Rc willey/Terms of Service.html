		</ul>

		<h2 class="h3">20. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, Jury Waiver</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Disputes</strong>. The terms of this section shall apply to all Disputes between you and RC Willey. For the purposes of this section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and RC Willey, including but not limited to disputes concerning these Terms of Use, your use of the Services, and/or privacy or publicity rights, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. YOU AND RC WILLEY AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY RC WILLEY FOR (1) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION; (2) PATENT INFRINGEMENT; (3) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE; AND/OR (4) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.</li>
			<li><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. You and RC Willey agree: (1) to arbitrate all Disputes between you and RC Willey pursuant to the provision of these Terms and Conditions; (2) these Terms and Conditions memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (3) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section (notwithstanding the choice-of-law provision contained herein); and (4) this Section shall survive termination in these Terms and Conditions.</li>
			<li><strong>Dispute Notice</strong>. In the event of a Dispute, you or RC Willey must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving
				(the “Dispute Notice”). The Dispute Notice to RC Willey must be addressed to <a href="mailTo:support@rcwilley.com">support@rcwilley.com</a> and 2301 South 300 West Salt Lake City, UT 84115 (“RC Willey Notice Address”). The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you, or via email if we do not have any such address on file. If RC Willey and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) calendar days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or RC Willey may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each party agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</li>
			<li><strong>Small Claims Court</strong>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state, municipality, province, or territory if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</li>
			<li><strong>WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS</strong>. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST RC WILLEY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU AND RC WILLEY AGREE THAT NO DISPUTE SHALL PROCEED BY WAY OF CLASS ARBITRATION WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES.</li>
			<li><strong>Arbitration Procedure</strong>. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as applicable; except AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions shall govern. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, territorial, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
			<li><strong>Hearing Format</strong>. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in Travis County, Texas, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses). In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written
			decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, in any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by RC Willey, or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or RC Willey is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</li>
			<li><strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>. RC Willey will pay, or (if applicable) reimburse you, for all AAA (as applicable) filing, administration, and arbitration fees for any arbitration commenced by you or RC Willey pursuant to these Terms of Use. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.</li>
			<li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>. You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in these Terms and Conditions by sending a written letter to RC Willey at 2301 South 300 West Salt Lake City, UT 84115 within thirty (30) calendar days of your initial agreement to these Terms and Conditions (including your first use of the Services) that specifies: (1) your name; (2) your mailing address; (3) and your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Section. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedures set forth above, all other terms of these Terms and Conditions shall continue to apply.</li>
			<li><strong>Amendments to this Section</strong>. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and RC Willey agree that if RC Willey makes any material amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in these Terms and Conditions, RC Willey will notify you and you will have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments by sending a written letter to the RC Willey Notice Address that specifies: (1) your name; (2) your mailing address; and (3) your request to opt-out of such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these Terms and Conditions, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.</li>
			<li><strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms and Conditions remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
			<li><strong>Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies</strong>. RC Willey and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the courts located within Salt Lake City, Utah, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such.</li>
