<p>This Privacy Policy is being provided to you by frontdoor, inc. (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frontdoor</span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>&rdquo;) on behalf of itself and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy applies to information we receive from or about you, including personally identifiable information, in connection with your access or use of: (a) the website frontdoorhome.com (together with any successor website, the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site</span>&rdquo;), (b) other interactive properties, including, but not limited to, any mobile applications enabling you to access the Site (together with the Site, the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frontdoor Applications</span>&rdquo;), (c) offline communications with Frontdoor, including direct mail, telephone and postal mail and (d) any other means or applications in which you connect with Frontdoor or a third party from whom Frontdoor receives information about you.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Frontdoor Applications, registering with, providing personal information to, or communicating with, Frontdoor, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use, storage and transfer (including international transfer) of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. THIS PRIVACY POLICY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Frontdoor Applications or provide us with personal information or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We may collect different types of information about you, depending upon how you interact with us. This information may include personal information, Financial Information, demographic information, log-in information and Device information. Sometimes we collect combinations of all these types of information or aggregate some or all of these types of information to improve products and services and facilitate other legitimate business purposes. In each case, when using the Frontdoor Applications, it is indicated on the Frontdoor Applications whether any personal information or demographic data must be provided for you to access and use the Frontdoor Applications or participate in the contemplated transaction.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Connecting with the Frontdoor Applications and Information Provided by You</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>When You Register or Otherwise Contact Us.</strong>&nbsp;When you provide us with information (including personal information) in connection with a particular activity, you agree that such action establishes a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to receiving communications from Frontdoor (and its affiliates and subsidiaries) through the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide the authorization to contact you. This means Frontdoor may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information.</strong>&nbsp;We will collect personal information from you if you register on the Frontdoor Applications or engage in a transaction with us, which may include, but is not limited to, name, address, phone number(s), and email address(es). You may not use a user/account name that is vulgar or otherwise offensive (as determined by Frontdoor), infringes any trademark or other proprietary rights of others, or is used in any way that violates the terms of use of the Site (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use</span>&rdquo;). Frontdoor reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the Frontdoor Applications (or refuse to enter into any transaction) without notice, for any or no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information.</strong>&nbsp;Financial information is information that you provide to us, including information relating to your investments in Frontdoor, if any, your bank account number, routing number, debit or credit card number and related billing information (collectively, the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Information</span>&rdquo;). We require such Financial Information in order to provide investment opportunities and process certain transactions that you have requested. By submitting your Financial Information, you consent to our providing your Financial Information to those Authorized Third Party Service Providers as are reasonably necessary to support and process your transactions. We ask that you do not enter Financial Information into your profile, except in the fields provided for that information.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong>&nbsp;You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Frontdoor Applications and your interaction with Frontdoor or take advantage of other features of the Frontdoor Applications. When you comment on the Frontdoor Applications using your Facebook username and password and click &ldquo;allow&rdquo; on the Facebook permission authorization screen, we will automatically import all information that you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile based upon your privacy settings at Facebook, such as your location, your interests, etc. (collectively, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Permitted Facebook Profile Content</span>&rdquo;) and you give us permission to:&nbsp; (a) capture, store, use and display your Permitted Facebook Profile Content, including syncing access to such Permitted Facebook Profile Content when you are not using Frontdoor Applications and (b) otherwise use Permitted Facebook Profile Content as described in this Privacy Policy. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials is conducted solely through Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content.</strong>&nbsp;The Frontdoor Applications may contain review or chat areas or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Frontdoor Applications (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communication Services</span>&rdquo;). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, and becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, Frontdoor. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Frontdoor Application or Communication Services and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content, including that which we deem inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs to track and record certain information. As you use our Frontdoor Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our service providers to coordinate and record your activity and fulfill your requests (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage Information</span>&rdquo;). We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Frontdoor Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Identifier</span>&rdquo;) from your computer (or other device) used to access the Frontdoor Applications (each, a &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device</span>&rdquo;). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Frontdoor Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Frontdoor Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Frontdoor Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Frontdoor Applications.</p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s). These servers are operated, and the cookies managed, by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you visit Frontdoor Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s). Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to a Frontdoor Application and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Frontdoor Applications. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with Frontdoor Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with Frontdoor Applications.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Session&rdquo; cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. &ldquo;Persistent&rdquo; cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided. &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and way data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. In some cases, you may be able to disable cookies on your Device. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Frontdoor Applications may not function properly. For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the Frontdoor Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access the Frontdoor Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure responses to our communications and improve the Frontdoor Applications and promotions.</p>
<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Frontdoor Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Frontdoor Applications and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers&rsquo; cookie files. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to personal information. For example, we use information we collect about Frontdoor Application users to optimize certain offerings and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with personal information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information You Provide About a Third Party</strong></span></p>
<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Frontdoor Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Frontdoor Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information We Collect from Third Parties</span></strong></p>
<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you have provided or that we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that Frontdoor can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest to you and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Analytic Technologies</span></strong></p>
<p>We use third parties&rsquo; analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the Frontdoor Applications, how people are using the Frontdoor Applications, how to improve the effectiveness of the Frontdoor Applications and their content and how to serve more targeted advertising to you. Those third-party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Frontdoor Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with Frontdoor Applications with personal information they collect from other sources and use this combined information to send you certain marketing or other communications. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties&rsquo; use of cookies or other tracking technologies.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise choice with respect to collection and use of the data by these third-party tools, you may visit:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</a></p>
<p>Some of the analytic and tracking tools we may use are Google Analytics and Google Analytics Advertising. The Google Analytics Advertising features we may use include the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Remarketing;</li>
<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting;</li>
<li>Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting; and</li>
<li>Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.</li>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Links to other Website(s) and Communities. </strong>To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third-party website(s) and communities, you should be aware that these external or third-party website(s) and communities are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each such website and community to determine how your information will be utilized.</p>
<p><strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard your information delivered to us electronically, the Frontdoor Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Frontdoor Applications, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, we advise that you log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to an Frontdoor Application. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.</p>
<p><strong>A Note to International Users.</strong> The Frontdoor Applications are operated in the United States. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Frontdoor Applications or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States. You are also consenting to the application of United States federal, and Tennessee state law in all matters concerning the Frontdoor Applications and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy.&nbsp;</strong>The Frontdoor Applications are generally intended for general adult audiences and are not directed or intended for children under thirteen years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under thirteen years of age. If you are under thirteen years of age, you should not register or provide personal information on the Frontdoor Applications. If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user who has provided personal information is under thirteen years of age, we will take steps to remove that user&rsquo;s personal information from our systems.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</strong>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Frontdoor Applications, with the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; posted at the top of the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new Frontdoor Applications or Communication Services or change existing ones. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information, you will know either because (a) the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy will change or (b) we will provide you with a copy of the updated Privacy Policy that includes an updated Effective Date. By accessing the Frontdoor Applications or interacting with us after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy for information captured after the Effective Date of that Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Disputes.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to visit the Frontdoor Applications your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of the United States and the State of Tennessee.</p>
