            5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DATA COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE
            PRACTICES.
          </h2>
          <p>
            We may disclose non-personally identifiable information, such as
            aggregated user statistics and certain usage information, with
            service providers and other third parties, including third party
            advertisers, content providers and analytics providers, may
            themselves collect such information when you visit the Sites. We do
            not disclose your Personal Information with third parties for their
            marketing purposes unless you agree to such sharing by opting in.
            You may opt-out of sharing by clicking the “<button
              class="show-ccpa-modal"
            >
              Do Not Sell or Share My Info</button
            >” link. We may disclose the information we have collected about
            you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you
            provide your information or otherwise with your consent (to the
            extent required by law), and as described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties Or
              Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information.</b
            >
            You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information
            and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree
            at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal
            Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and
            will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third
            party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices
            of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want
            to receive communications from a third party, you will need to
            contact that third party directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive
            feature or third party application, that we share information about
            you with a third party and we will typically do so under those
            circumstances. For example, if you "like" content on our Sites,
            information about you may transfer to the third party offering that
            application on our Sites and to the third party web site to which
            you are posting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf.</b> We may use
            third party service providers to perform certain services on behalf
            of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating
            the Sites' features, analyzing users' interactions with the Sites,
            sending communications, safeguarding against fraud, or performing
            other administrative services. We may provide these service
            providers with access to user information, including Personal
            Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you
            or for the Sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</b> We may offer
            sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (a "Promotion") that may
            require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are
            agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that
            Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you,
            including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s)
            of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia
            of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the
            Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information
            may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with
            the administration of such Promotion including, without limitation,
            in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as
            required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such
            as on a winners list.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Administrative and Legal Reasons.</b> We may also transfer and
            disclose user information, including Personal Information, to third
            parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or
            other legal process or if in our opinion such disclosure is required
            by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting
            an investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Sites'

            or other policies applicable to the Sites or to protect the personal
            safety, rights, property or security of any individual. To that
            extent, we may disclose certain Personal Information to a third
            party we engage to protect against fraud and the unauthorized use of
            credit and gift cards. We may also use Device Identifiers (e.g., IP
            addresses) to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with
            copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service
            providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. These
            disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

          <h2>8. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
          <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA") provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the 
            collection, use, and sharing of Personal Information,</p>
          <p>
            In addition to the rights described above in Section 7, California
            residents have the following rights:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><i>Right to Opt Out of Sale</i></b> – You have the right to
            opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of your Personal Information. We use
            your Personal Information for the purposes described in the
            <a href="#1" target="_blank">Information We Collect</a> section
            above, some of which may be considered to be a Sale or Sharing under
            applicable privacy laws and you may have the right to request to
            opt-out of such data uses. To exercise this right, please click the
            “<button class="show-ccpa-modal">
              Do Not Sell or Share My Info</button
            >” link, call us at +1-888-269-1005, or set your browser Global
            Privacy Controls to send this signal when you visit our Sites.

                >Right to Limit the use of Sensitive Personal Information</i
              ></b
            >
            – The CCPA gives consumers the right to limit the use of their
            Sensitive Personal Information to only the purposes for which it was
            collected. We only use Sensitive Personal Information for the
            purpose for which it was collected, in aggregated and deidentified
            form to gain insights about our audience, and we do not use it to
            infer characteristics about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><i>California Shine the Light</i></b> – Pursuant to California
            Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California
            have the right to request, once a year, a list of all third parties
            to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal
            Information, such as those outlined in Sections 3 and 4, during the
            preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and
            the categories of Personal Information the company shares.
            Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as VICE
            does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers
            choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information
            with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing
            purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated
            below in this Privacy Policy, VICE provides you choice prior to
            sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their
            direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt in or if you choose to
            opt out at the time VICE offers that choice, VICE does not share
            your information with that identified third party for its direct
            marketing purposes.
