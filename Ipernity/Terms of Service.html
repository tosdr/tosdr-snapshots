<h3>4. Privacy policy and supervising children</h3>
<p>
Information about our data protection practices can be found at: www.ipernity.com/about/you<br />
</p>
<p>
4.1 Ipernity is aware of the need to protect the privacy and security users of the Website, especially minors, as much as possible. When you upload Content, you are responsible for assigning the appropriate visibility option of private, family, friends or public. The reliability of the system cannot be 100% guaranteed. Parents who wish to allow their children access to the Website should assist them in setting up any relevant accounts and supervise their access to the Website. By allowing your child access to the Website, they will be able to access all of the features including, internal email, message boards, instant messages and chat (among others). Please remember that the Website is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the features and/or Content is appropriate for your child.<br />
</p>
<p>
4.2 By using the Website, you acknowledge, consent and agree that ipernity may access, preserve and disclose your account information and any Content associated with that account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:<br />

</ul>
<ul>
<li>(b) enforce the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations hereof;</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>
4.3 You understand and agree that the technical processing and transmission of the Website, including your Content may involve:<br />
</p>

</ul>
<h3>5. Proprietary rights</h3>

<li>Ipernity’s rights</li>
</ul>
<p>
5.1 You acknowledge, consent and agree that the ipernity Website and any necessary software used in connection with the Website ("Software") contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws and treaties.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.2 Subject to the Terms of Use, ipernity grants you a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and license to use the object code of its Software; provided that you do not (and do not allow any third party to):<br />

</ul>

</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
5.4 You consent and agree not to access the Website by any means other than through the interface or software that is provided by ipernity for use to access the Website or third-parties applications explicitly authorized by ipernity.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.5 You further consent and agree not to remove, obscure or alter ipernity's or any third-party's copyright notices, trademarks or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within or accessed with or through the Software.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.6 You acknowledge and agree that third-parties, including ipernity users, own all rights, titles and interests in and to Content hosted by the Website or otherwise presented to you through ipernity. You consent that this Content is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties, which you are held to comply with.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your rights</li>
</ul>
<p>
5.7 Ipernity does not claim ownership of Content you submit, post or display or make available on or through the Website. You or a third-party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark, and copyright to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Website and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.8 The Content declared private and submitted to the Website might be seen fortuitously from the public, in case of user misuse of the features, pirating, hacking or computer related errors. It is therefore strongly recommended to not submit any confidential, private or sensitive data and information.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.9 By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Website, you grant ipernity a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such Content through the Website, including through RSS or any other Content feeds offered by the Website.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.10 In addition, by submitting, posting or presenting Content intended to be available for the public, you grant ipernity a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to reproduce, edit, distribute and publish such Content for the purpose of presenting and promoting the Association.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.11 Ipernity reserves for itself the right to deny, at its sole discretion, to post, display or transmit any Content.<br />
</p>
<p>
5.12 Ipernity will discontinue this licensed use within a commercially reasonable period after such Content is removed from the Website.<br />
</p>
<h3>6. Copyright, trademark and intellectual property policies</h3>
<p>
6.1 It is ipernity’s policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the French law or other applicable intellectual property laws. Any breach of a rule or complaint from any eligible party will irrevocably result in removing or disabling access to the material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.<br />
</p>
<p>
6.2 Be reminded that both the illicit exchange of protected works and recordings and their pirating seriously damage the artistic work. You also acknowledge that the non-respect of laws in force, notably those protecting the intellectual and artistic property could lead to prosecutions and sentences.<br />
</p>
<p>
6.3 All or parts of the Content hosted by the Website can, by assent of their owners, be published on other websites that ipernity has no knowledge of (“External Sites”) through links provided by the Website. When you use such links and insert them on External Sites, you engage yourself to refer the published Content to the page of the Website hosting the Content, via a clickable link. This arrangement goes without saying within the general pattern of protecting intellectual property, copyright and works.<br />
</p>
<p>
