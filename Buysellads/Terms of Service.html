<p>You may fund your account in two ways: (1) you can deposit funds into your account via a credit card, wire transfer, Bitcoin, or PayPal ("Deposited Funds"); and (2) you can earn funds by selling ads as a publisher ("Earned Funds"). Deposited Funds will appear in your Account balance and be available for you to purchase ads; however, Deposited Funds may not be cashed out. Earned Funds will generally appear in your Account balance approximately thirty (30) days after one of your ads has been purchased, and Earned Funds may be cashed out upon your request per the instructions given elsewhere on the Site. Please note that if your Account is inactive for a six-month period (i.e. you have not signed into your Account, you have not added more Deposited Funds, you have not purchased any ads, or you have not received any Earned Funds during that time), then we may deem your Account inactive and at such time we will charge an inactive account fee to preserve your data in the amount of $100.00 per month against your Account balance and will continue to be charged each month until your balance reaches $0 or until your Account becomes active again. If your Account is inactive for a twelve-month period, your Account balance will be charged as an inactive fee. Company may, but has no obligation to, give you prior notice of the imposition of any inactive fee. PLEASE NOTE OUR REFUND POLICY (https://buysellads.com/refunds), WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THESE TERMS BY REFERENCE HEREIN.</p>
<p>In addition to our other rights and remedies, we may (a) withhold and offset any payments owed to you under the Agreement against any fees you owe us under the Agreement or any other agreement, or (b) require you to refund us within 30 days of any invoice, any amounts we may have overpaid to you in prior periods. If you dispute any payment made or withheld relating to the Service, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of any such payment. If you do not, any claim relating to the disputed payment is waived. If an advertiser whose ads are displayed on any website defaults on payment to us, we may withhold payment or charge back your account. To ensure proper payment, you are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in your account. You are responsible for any charges assessed by your bank or payment provider.</p>

<p>Company reserves the right in its sole discretion, and without any prior notice, to terminate your access to the Service for any reason, including your breach of these Terms of Service, the terms and conditions of any service for which you may have registered, or a violation of the rights of another user or the law. You may unsubscribe from any further communication from Company at any time by delivering a written notice addressed to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:support@buysellads.com">support@buysellads.com</a>. You shall be responsible for ensuring delivery of the notice to Company. You may also unsubscribe by clicking the Email Preferences link or the opt-out link in any of the Company emails.

<h3>10. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of Company's Service, to the goods or services provided by Company, or to any acts or omissions for which you may contend Company is liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy ("Dispute"), shall be finally, and exclusively, settled by arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, from which arbitration there shall be no appeal. The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in force at that time. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the AAA rules. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of Massachusetts, except that the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefore. Each part shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction in Massachusetts. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages in connection with any Dispute in excess of actual compensatory damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of arbitration under this Agreement with arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Company WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU THUS GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Company ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.</p>
<h3>11. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
<p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>
<h3>12. General</h3>
<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Massachusetts; and (ii) this Service shall be deemed a passive web site and service that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Company, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Massachusetts. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Massachusetts, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Boston, Massachusetts or the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, for any actions for which either party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, as further described in the Arbitration provision above. These Terms of Service, together with the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.buysellads.com/about/privacy?__hstc=233546881.56f99d530d54cfb87bb3d1ae6d2e1f5a.1634487785573.1634487785573.1634487785573.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.56.1634481803256&amp;__hsfp=2206047309">Privacy Policy</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and any other legal notices published by us on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning this Service and supersedes any prior written or oral representations. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise expressly agreed in this Agreement, this Agreement is non-¬‐exclusive and either party may engage in similar or other relationships, agreements or arrangements with any other party. Except as agreed in an Order Form, neither party promises any level of business or outcomes to the other. YOU AND Company AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. These Terms of Service may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. Pursuant to any applicable laws, rules or regulations, including without limitation the US Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, P.L. 106-229 or other similar statutes, CLIENT HEREBY AGREES TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS. Further, Client hereby waives any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other laws in any jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of non-¬‐electronic records, or to payments or the granting of credits by other than electronic means. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Company.</p>
