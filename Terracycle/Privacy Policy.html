<h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>

<p>What are cookies?</p>

<p>We may collect information using &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; or similar technologies (altogether, &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;). Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p>

<p>We use two broad categories of Cookies: (1) first party Cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party Cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>

<p>Cookies we use</p>

<p>Our Site uses the following types of Cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>

<p>Type of cookie:&nbsp;Local Storage</p>

<p>Purpose:&nbsp;This technology allows our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site. The purpose of this is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Site.</p>

<p>Type of cookie:&nbsp;Analytics and Performance Cookies</p>

<p>Purpose:&nbsp;These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.&nbsp; We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Site, and improve the Site.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">here</a>&nbsp;and about how Google protects your data&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">here</a>.&nbsp; You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available&nbsp;<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">here</a>.</p>

In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the &ldquo;settings,&rdquo; &ldquo;help&rdquo; &ldquo;tools&rdquo; or &ldquo;edit&rdquo; facility).&nbsp; Many browsers are set to accept Cookies until you change your settings.</p>
