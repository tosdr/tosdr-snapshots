<p>
  TrackJS LLC ("TrackJS", "we", "us") provides error tracking services ("Services")
  for web applications. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and
  their users. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our
  practices in gathering, securing, and using application and personal data.
</p>
<p>
  By making Application Data or Personal Data available to us through our website,
  Services, or related communication, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
  Policy and your expressly consent to the processing of your Application Data
  and Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may
  be processed outside the country in which it was collected, where laws regarding
  processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  such Data in the course of using our website, Services, or related materials.
  For example, when you subscribe to our newsletter you volunteer your name and
  email address.
</p>

<h3>Data We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p>
  TrackJS and our service providers collect certain technical information automatically
  when you visit our website or use our Services, such as your browser, operating
  system, referrer, IP address, and other Internet data. We gather this information
  with the use of cookies.
</p>

<h3>Data Collected for Business</h3>
<p>
  We may store and collect Personal Data from you when you do business with us, such

  relations with you as your vendor, supplier, or other third party.
</p>

<h3>Data Collected as your Data Processor</h3>
<p>
  TrackJS collects data on behalf of our customers in the context of providing
  our Services. All data collection provided by the Service is completely controlled by the
  customer, so you can choose the right level of information collection and privacy for
  your needs. For example, you can configure the Services to ignore or anonymize IP Addresses
  from your users should you not want TrackJS to store that data. For more information on
  configuring the service, see <a href="https://docs.trackjs.com/">the Documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>
  TrackJS uses a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Data. All
  supplied payment information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and
  then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those
  authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
  confidential. After a transaction, your private information (e.g., credit cards) will not be
  stored on our servers.
</p>
<p>
  TrackJS will never sell your Personal Data to anyone. Your Personal Data is only accessible to
  TrackJS employees, contractors, and our service providers that require access in order to
  administer the TrackJS website, services, or related materials, or to provide you with
  support and assistance.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
  Personal Data we collect from you is used either to respond to requests that you make, or
  to aid us in serving you better. TrackJS uses your Personal Data in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To create and secure your account on our network,
  </li>
  <li>
    To identify you as a user in our system,
  </li>
  <li>
    To provide improved administration of our website, Services, and related materials,
  </li>
  <li>
    To improve the quality of experience when you interact with our website, Services, and related materials,
  </li>

  <li>
    To solicit your feedback on our Services.
  </li>
</ul>
