<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE AGENTS AND SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TRACKJS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS. TRACKJS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<h2 id="7-limitation-of-liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>TRACKJS’ ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER, FOR BREACH OF, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE AGENTS AND SERVICES, IS LIMITED TO THE PAYMENTS ACTUALLY MADE BY THE CUSTOMER FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO ANY LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL TRACKJS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSSES OR EXPENSES, WHETHER OR NOT TRACKJS WAS ADVISED OF, KNEW OF SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.</p>

<h2 id="8-indemnification">8. Indemnification</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold TrackJS, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Services provided under this Agreement or any act or omission by you (including the entity on whose behalf you are entering into this Agreement). This indemnity obligation will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement by either party for any reason.</p>

<p>TrackJS will indemnify and hold you, and your subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners and employees harmless from any claim or demand made by any third party claim that the Service infringes, misappropriates, or violates such third party’s  valid United States: patent, copyright, trade secret, trademarks or other intellectual property right. If any of the Service or any portion thereof is held, or in TrackJS’s reasonable opinion is likely to be held, in any such claim to constitute such an infringement, misappropriation, or violation, TrackJS will, within a reasonable time, at its expense and option, either: (i) secure for you the right to continue the use of such Service; or (ii) replace such Service with a substantially equivalent item that is not subject to any such claim, or modify such Service so that it becomes no longer subject to any such claim. If TrackJS is, in TrackJS’s reasonable discretion, unable to either procure the right to continued use of such Service or replace such Service, as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, you will cease using the Service, and TrackJS will refund to you any fees for the Service pro rata for the time remaining in the applicable term.</p>

<h2 id="9-confidentiality">9. Confidentiality</h2>

<p>TrackJS acknowledges that you may disclose non-public, confidential information to TrackJS under this Agreement and you acknowledge that the Agents and Services provided to you, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement are confidential and proprietary to TrackJS. Each party agrees to take all reasonably necessary action, including appropriate instructions and agreements with employees and agents, to protect such confidential and proprietary information of the other party from unauthorized disclosure. In the event of any breach of this section, each party acknowledges that the non-breaching party would suffer irreparable harm and shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief without the necessity of posting bond. You also acknowledge that infringement or unauthorized copying of the intellectual property of TrackJS would cause irreparable harm to TrackJS.</p>

<h2 id="10-publicity">10. Publicity</h2>

<p>You are permitted to state publicly that you are a Subscriber of TrackJS. You agree that TrackJS may include your name and trademarks in a list of TrackJS Customers, online or in promotional materials. You also agree that TrackJS may verbally reference you as a customer of the Service. You may opt out of the provisions in this Section by sending an email opt-out request to hello@trackjs.com.</p>

<h2 id="11-governing-law-and-venue">11. Governing Law and Venue</h2>

<p>The Service is controlled and operated within the United States, and is not intended to subject TrackJS to any law or jurisdiction outside of the United States. Use of the Service is prohibited in any jurisdiction having laws that would void this Agreement in whole or essential part or which makes accessing the Service illegal. This Agreement is entered into and performed in the State of Minnesota, United States of America. It is governed by and shall be construed under the laws of Minnesota, exclusive of any choice of law or conflict of laws provisions. In any claim or action directly or indirectly arising under this Agreement or related to the Site, Services or Agents, each party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of the Minnesota State District Court sitting in Washington County, Minnesota or of the United States Court for the District of Minnesota. Each party waives any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to these courts. You agree that you shall pursue any claim against TrackJS in your individual capacity only, and you will not participate in any collective or so-called “class” action against us.</p>

<h2 id="12-general-provisions">12. General Provisions</h2>

<p>This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. Any waiver of or modification to the terms of this Agreement will not be effective unless executed in writing and signed by TrackJS. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, such holding shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement. The software is controlled by U.S. Export Regulations, and it may not be exported to or used by embargoed countries or individuals. By agreeing to this Agreement you also agree to our collection, use and disclosure of information as described in the most-recent version of our Privacy Policy published at https://trackjs.com/privacy/.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-this-agreement">Changes To This Agreement</h2>

<p>TrackJS reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms of Service by posting the updated terms on the Site. Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
