We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it.<br><br><div id="section-9"><strong>9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></div><br>Scopely values its players and their concerns, and we want to work with you to resolve any disputes as quickly and efficiently as possible for both of us. This Dispute Resolution section discusses how disputes between us will be resolved through our informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court. <br><br>Our informal dispute resolution process is designed to help you resolve issues early by working with our player care team to address the issue, without having to go any further. If we are unable to resolve the issue together informally, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, your access or use of the Services, or your relationship with Scopely (or any of its past or future parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors) will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except that either you or Scopely may take a dispute to small claims court so long as it isn’t removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. <br><br>Dispute shall be interpreted broadly and include, but not be limited to: (i) any claim that arose before the existence of these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (ii) any claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iii) any claim that may arise after termination of these Terms. Dispute, however, does not include the exceptions set forth below.<br><br><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong><br><br>If a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first follow these steps:<br><ol><br> 	<li>1. CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.</li><br> 	<li>2. IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.</li><br> 	<li>3. ESCALATION: If you have followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our player care team has stated that a matter is closed, please email us at support@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and information sufficient to identify your Account, the specific issue you believe is unresolved, and the relief you are seeking. Our player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue over the next sixty (60) days. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. You agree that if a request if made to speak about the issue, you will personally participate. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes. Any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled during the sixty (60) day Escalation process.</li></ol><br><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong><br><ul><br><li>If your dispute remains unresolved after you have exhausted our informal dispute resolution process above, you may seek to resolve it through binding individual arbitration as follows:</li><br><li>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute  on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the informal dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved. This agreement precludes you from bringing any class action against Scopely. It applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.</li></ul><br>An arbitration proceeding is before a single neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. An arbitrator must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general,  or representative proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.<br><br><strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong><br><br>We all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:<br><ol><br> 	<li>Your or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or</li><br> 	<li>Claims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they are brought.</li><br></ol><br><strong>No Class Actions</strong><br><br>We all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis whether in arbitration or in court.<br><br>That means:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Neither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or participate as a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or in court. However, you and we retain the right to participate in a class-wide settlement. </li><br> 	<li>The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).</li><br></ul><br>The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.<br><br><strong>The Arbitration Process, Rules, and Fees</strong><br><br>The American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, if applicable) (“<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), as modified by these Terms. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website (<a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>). If either you or we decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.<br><br>A Demand for Arbitration must be accompanied by an attestation of compliance with the informal dispute resolution process described above and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By submitting a Demand for Arbitration, the party and their counsel will represent that  they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), like they would in court. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and their counsel. You and we understand and agree that the AAA’s administrative determination that this arbitration agreement comports with the Consumer Due Process Protocol is final and that neither a court nor an arbitrator has the authority to revisit it. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with these Terms, the parties shall agree on an administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so. <br><br>The arbitration will take place in the county, parish, or province where you live. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.<br><br>Either of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e., make it the same as a court judgment), except an award that has been satisfied may not be entered in any court. Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.<br><br>Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.<br><br>Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and fee schedule. You and Scopely agree that we have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or Scopely may elect to engage with the AAA regarding arbitration fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all of us.<br><br><strong>Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration</strong><br><br>You and we agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration (in addition to the rest of Terms) will apply if you decide to participate in a Mass Arbitration. If 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“<strong>Mass Arbitration</strong>”), you agree that the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. If you decide to bring your dispute as part of a Mass Arbitration, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled for your dispute from the time that your dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a stage (as explained below) or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration as part of these procedures.<br><br>A Process Arbitrator will be appointed through a rank-and-strike selection process to address any issues contemplated by the AAA Rules. In addition, should Scopely make such a request, the Process Arbitrator will determine whether each dispute brought as part of the Mass Arbitration (including yours) has been specifically authorized and whether each claimant (including you) has actual knowledge of the submission. The Process Arbitrator has the authority to: (i) grant any request for discovery to help the Process Arbitrator decide whether there was authorization and actual knowledge; and (ii) award relief if the Process Arbitrator finds the submissions were not specifically authorized or made with actual knowledge of the claimants.  <br><br><strong>STAGE ONE</strong>: If at least 500 disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Scopely will each select 250 disputes (500 total) to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. If there are fewer than 500 disputes submitted, then each of them will proceed as cases in individual arbitrations at that time. Each of the cases will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before an arbitration award is issued, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining disputes won’t be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those disputes. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall pay the mediator’s fee.<br><br><strong>STAGE TWO</strong>: If the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, the same staged process set forth for Stage One will repeat for Stage Two with 500 total disputes proceeding in individual arbitrations except that arbitrators who presided over a case in Stage One may be appointed to preside over a dispute that proceeds as part of Stage Two, unless either party objects. After this second set of staged proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall again pay the mediator’s fee.<br><br>Upon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn will be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms. However, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the staged process set forth above (except disputes to proceed in any later stages will be randomly chosen and mediation will be optional) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.<br><br>The Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and may only proceed individually in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.<br><br><strong>Future Changes to this Dispute Resolution Section</strong><br><br>If we make any future changes to the Dispute Resolution Section (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice within thirty (30) days of the changes to:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>Scopely, Inc.  <br>Attn: Chief Legal Officer <br>3505 Hayden Ave. <br>Culver City, CA 90232<br></div><br>Such written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration or the class action waiver.

All purchases and redemptions of such Virtual Items through our Services are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by us. Scopely may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice to you.

We may also from time to time provide certain users with offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or payments charged to your Account. If you choose to sign up for a subscription or VIP experience in connection with the Services, payments will be enabled in accordance with the terms displayed to you at the point of purchase, and available to you thereafter on the applicable Service(s).

Those terms will also explain how to cancel a subscription and the time period in which you should do so before you will be charged. Those terms will also be available to you after you sign up, including in-game through the Help settings.<br><br><br><div id="section-6"><strong>6. UPDATES TO OUR SERVICES</strong></div><br>You understand that our Services are developing and evolving. Scopely may require that you accept updates to our Services. While Scopely will make all reasonable efforts to inform you of any such updates, you acknowledge and agree that Scopely may update our Services, with or without informing or otherwise notifying you. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to receive our Services and/or play our games.<br><br><br><div id="section-7"><strong>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong></div><br>Without limiting Scopely’s liability under Section 8 below, the Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis for your use, with no warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. Scopely does not warrant that you will be able to access or use our Services at the times or locations of your choosing; that our Services will be of a certain quality or suitability, or will be uninterrupted or error-free; that defects will be corrected; or that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.<br><br><br><div id="section-8"><strong>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</strong></div><br><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br><br>Scopely will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other similar damages, including but not limited to loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business interruption or other intangible losses (however such losses are qualified), arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or our Services, whether based on contract, tort or any other legal theory, and whether or not Scopely has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Scopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Scopely during such time period, your sole remedy (and Scopely’s exclusive liability) for any dispute with Scopely is to stop using the Services and to cancel your Account. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you must provide notice of any dispute you have with Scopely within one (1) year of the dispute occurring, or it is forever waived and time barred. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you.<br><br>To the extent that Scopely may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Scopely’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law. In particular, nothing in these Terms will affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Scopely. This provision shall have no effect on the choice of law provision set forth below.<br><br><strong>Indemnification</strong><br><br>You agree to indemnify, save, and hold Scopely, its affiliated companies, officers, directors, contractors, employees, agents, third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages, and liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to: (i) your use or misuse of our Services or goods or services obtained in connection therewith; (ii) your breach or violation of these Terms; (iii) our use of your User Content; or (iv) any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it.<br><br><div id="section-9"><strong>9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></div><br>Scopely values its players and their concerns, and we want to work with you to resolve any disputes as quickly and efficiently as possible for both of us. This Dispute Resolution section discusses how disputes between us will be resolved through our informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court. <br><br>Our informal dispute resolution process is designed to help you resolve issues early by working with our player care team to address the issue, without having to go any further. If we are unable to resolve the issue together informally, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, your access or use of the Services, or your relationship with Scopely (or any of its past or future parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors) will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except that either you or Scopely may take a dispute to small claims court so long as it isn’t removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. <br><br>Dispute shall be interpreted broadly and include, but not be limited to: (i) any claim that arose before the existence of these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (ii) any claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iii) any claim that may arise after termination of these Terms. Dispute, however, does not include the exceptions set forth below.<br><br><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong><br><br>If a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first follow these steps:<br><ol><br> 	<li>1. CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.</li><br> 	<li>2. IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.</li><br> 	<li>3. ESCALATION: If you have followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our player care team has stated that a matter is closed, please email us at support@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and information sufficient to identify your Account, the specific issue you believe is unresolved, and the relief you are seeking. Our player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue over the next sixty (60) days. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. You agree that if a request if made to speak about the issue, you will personally participate. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes. Any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled during the sixty (60) day Escalation process.</li></ol><br><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong><br><ul><br><li>If your dispute remains unresolved after you have exhausted our informal dispute resolution process above, you may seek to resolve it through binding individual arbitration as follows:</li><br><li>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute  on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the informal dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved. This agreement precludes you from bringing any class action against Scopely. It applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.</li></ul><br>An arbitration proceeding is before a single neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. An arbitrator must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general,  or representative proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.<br><br><strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong><br><br>We all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:<br><ol><br> 	<li>Your or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or</li><br> 	<li>Claims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they are brought.</li><br></ol><br><strong>No Class Actions</strong><br><br>We all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis whether in arbitration or in court.<br><br>That means:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Neither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or participate as a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or in court. However, you and we retain the right to participate in a class-wide settlement. </li><br> 	<li>The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).</li><br></ul><br>The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.<br><br><strong>The Arbitration Process, Rules, and Fees</strong><br><br>The American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, if applicable) (“<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), as modified by these Terms. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website (<a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>). If either you or we decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.<br><br>A Demand for Arbitration must be accompanied by an attestation of compliance with the informal dispute resolution process described above and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By submitting a Demand for Arbitration, the party and their counsel will represent that  they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), like they would in court. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and their counsel. You and we understand and agree that the AAA’s administrative determination that this arbitration agreement comports with the Consumer Due Process Protocol is final and that neither a court nor an arbitrator has the authority to revisit it. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with these Terms, the parties shall agree on an administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so. <br><br>The arbitration will take place in the county, parish, or province where you live. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.<br><br>Either of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e., make it the same as a court judgment), except an award that has been satisfied may not be entered in any court. Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.<br><br>Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.<br><br>Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and fee schedule. You and Scopely agree that we have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or Scopely may elect to engage with the AAA regarding arbitration fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all of us.<br><br><strong>Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration</strong><br><br>You and we agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration (in addition to the rest of Terms) will apply if you decide to participate in a Mass Arbitration. If 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“<strong>Mass Arbitration</strong>”), you agree that the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. If you decide to bring your dispute as part of a Mass Arbitration, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled for your dispute from the time that your dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a stage (as explained below) or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration as part of these procedures.<br><br>A Process Arbitrator will be appointed through a rank-and-strike selection process to address any issues contemplated by the AAA Rules. In addition, should Scopely make such a request, the Process Arbitrator will determine whether each dispute brought as part of the Mass Arbitration (including yours) has been specifically authorized and whether each claimant (including you) has actual knowledge of the submission. The Process Arbitrator has the authority to: (i) grant any request for discovery to help the Process Arbitrator decide whether there was authorization and actual knowledge; and (ii) award relief if the Process Arbitrator finds the submissions were not specifically authorized or made with actual knowledge of the claimants.  <br><br><strong>STAGE ONE</strong>: If at least 500 disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Scopely will each select 250 disputes (500 total) to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. If there are fewer than 500 disputes submitted, then each of them will proceed as cases in individual arbitrations at that time. Each of the cases will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before an arbitration award is issued, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining disputes won’t be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those disputes. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall pay the mediator’s fee.<br><br><strong>STAGE TWO</strong>: If the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, the same staged process set forth for Stage One will repeat for Stage Two with 500 total disputes proceeding in individual arbitrations except that arbitrators who presided over a case in Stage One may be appointed to preside over a dispute that proceeds as part of Stage Two, unless either party objects. After this second set of staged proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall again pay the mediator’s fee.<br><br>Upon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn will be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms. However, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the staged process set forth above (except disputes to proceed in any later stages will be randomly chosen and mediation will be optional) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.<br><br>The Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and may only proceed individually in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.<br><br><strong>Future Changes to this Dispute Resolution Section</strong><br><br>If we make any future changes to the Dispute Resolution Section (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice within thirty (30) days of the changes to:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>Scopely, Inc.  <br>Attn: Chief Legal Officer <br>3505 Hayden Ave. <br>Culver City, CA 90232<br></div><br>Such written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration or the class action waiver.

year ended December 31, 2023.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>This document outlines the approach to tax strategy, tax risk, and planning for the UK<br>subsidiaries and affiliates within the Group, and is meant to cover all applicable taxes for the UK sub-group, including corporate tax, payroll taxes, and VAT. This strategy is reviewed and approved by UK senior leadership.<br><br><strong>Risk Management and Governance</strong><br><br>As outlined in our Code of Conduct, the Group and its employees are committed to not only complying with all applicable laws and regulations, but also going above and beyond these standards to conduct our business in the most honest and ethical manner possible wherever operations are maintained.<br><br>This level of standard in the Code of Conduct is applied to our approach in managing tax risk and governance in the UK, and in all jurisdictions where the Group operates. We diligently monitor applicable tax laws and regulations to ensure that UK tax is paid appropriately and timely, tax reporting and disclosure requirements are met, and that tax risk is minimized.<br><br>Due to the complexity and constant changes in global tax, we manage tax risks and uncertainty internally, but we also seek guidance from outside advisors to inform our decision making and strategy. Key tax decisions are made at the appropriate levels and in consultation with senior leadership.<br><br><strong>Tax Planning</strong><br><br>Our focus is to ensure compliance with applicable laws in keeping with our Code of Conduct, and that tax planning aligns with the natural state of business expansion and operating objectives. We seek guidance from external advisors as appropriate to navigate complex tax rules and minimize uncertainty in interpretation.<br><br><strong>Level of Tax Risk</strong><br><br>The UK sub-group is part of a much larger global tax group, and therefore the level of tax risk is assessed as a global organization. The Group is focused on proactively assessing the relevancy and applicability of tax legislation to maintain low levels of tax risk or uncertainty of tax positions. External tax advisors are consulted as needed.<br><br><strong>Engaging with HMRC</strong><br><br>The UK sub-group aims to have a professional, transparent, and collaborative relationship with the HMRC on all tax matters whether historic, future, or prospective.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="relative"><div class="absolute inset-x-0 top-0 h-[85%] -z-10"><div class="flex flex-col items-stretch w-full h-full justify-items-stretch"><div class="w-full h-full" style="background-color:#FFFFFF"></div><div class="w-full hidden md:block -translate-y-[1px]"><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 400 1440 1425" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M460.814 1425L0 964.206L0.570862 -153H1440V1122.52H764.423L460.814 1425Z" fill="#FFFFFF" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div><div class="md:hidden -translate-y-[.1px] translate-x-[1px] w-full"><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 382 152" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M84.006 152 382 0H0v58.029z" fill="#FFFFFF" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div><div class="bg-transparent "><div class="w-full xxxl:max-w-[2300px] xxxl:mx-auto

Scopely does not warrant that you will be able to access or use our Services at the times or locations of your choosing; that our Services will be of a certain quality or suitability, or will be uninterrupted or error-free; that defects will be corrected; or that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.\n\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"section-8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.

Scopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Scopely during such time period, your sole remedy (and Scopely’s exclusive liability) for any dispute with Scopely is to stop using the Services and to cancel your Account. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you must provide notice of any dispute you have with Scopely within one (1) year of the dispute occurring, or it is forever waived and time barred. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you.\n\nTo the extent that Scopely may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Scopely’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"section-9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.

This Dispute Resolution section discusses how disputes between us will be resolved through our informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court. \n\nOur informal dispute resolution process is designed to help you resolve issues early by working with our player care team to address the issue, without having to go any further. If we are unable to resolve the issue together informally, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, your access or use of the Services, or your relationship with Scopely (or any of its past or future parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors) will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except that either you or Scopely may take a dispute to small claims court so long as it isn’t removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. \n\nDispute shall be interpreted broadly and include, but not be limited to: (i) any claim that arose before the existence of these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (ii) any claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iii) any claim that may arise after termination of these Terms. Dispute, however, does not include the exceptions set forth below.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eInformal Dispute Resolution\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIf a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first follow these steps:\n\u003col\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003e1. CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003e2. IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003e3. ESCALATION: If you have followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our player care team has stated that a matter is closed, please email us at support@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and information sufficient to identify your Account, the specific issue you believe is unresolved, and the relief you are seeking. Our player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue over the next sixty (60) days. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. You agree that if a request if made to speak about the issue, you will personally participate. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes.

This agreement precludes you from bringing any class action against Scopely. It applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\nAn arbitration proceeding is before a single neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. An arbitrator must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general,  or representative proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:\n\u003col\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eYour or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eClaims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they are brought.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNo Class Actions\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis whether in arbitration or in court.\n\nThat means:\n\u003cul\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eNeither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or participate as a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or in court. However, you and we retain the right to participate in a class-wide settlement. \u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eThe arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThe arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Arbitration Process, Rules, and Fees\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThe American Arbitration Association (“\u003cstrong\u003eAAA\u003c/strong\u003e”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, if applicable) (“\u003cstrong\u003eAAA Rules\u003c/strong\u003e”), as modified by these Terms. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.adr.org\"\u003ewww.adr.org\u003c/a\u003e). If either you or we decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n\nA Demand for Arbitration must be accompanied by an attestation of compliance with the informal dispute resolution process described above and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By submitting a Demand for Arbitration, the party and their counsel will represent that  they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), like they would in court. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and their counsel. You and we understand and agree that the AAA’s administrative determination that this arbitration agreement comports with the Consumer Due Process Protocol is final and that neither a court nor an arbitrator has the authority to revisit it. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with these Terms, the parties shall agree on an administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so. \n\nThe arbitration will take place in the county, parish, or province where you live. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.\n\nEither of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e., make it the same as a court judgment), except an award that has been satisfied may not be entered in any court. Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.\n\nNotwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.\n\nPayment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and fee schedule. You and Scopely agree that we have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or Scopely may elect to engage with the AAA regarding arbitration fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all of us.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional Procedures for Mass Arbitration\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nYou and we agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration (in addition to the rest of Terms) will apply if you decide to participate in a Mass Arbitration. If 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“**Mass Arbitration**”), you agree that the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. If you decide to bring your dispute as part of a Mass Arbitration, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled for your dispute from the time that your dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a stage (as explained below) or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration as part of these procedures.\n\nA Process Arbitrator will be appointed through a rank-and-strike selection process to address any issues contemplated by the AAA Rules. In addition, should Scopely make such a request, the Process Arbitrator will determine whether each dispute brought as part of the Mass Arbitration (including yours) has been specifically authorized and whether each claimant (including you) has actual knowledge of the submission. The Process Arbitrator has the authority to: (i) grant any request for discovery to help the Process Arbitrator decide whether there was authorization and actual knowledge; and (ii) award relief if the Process Arbitrator finds the submissions were not specifically authorized or made with actual knowledge of the claimants.  \n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSTAGE ONE\u003c/strong\u003e: If at least 500 disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Scopely will each select 250 disputes (500 total) to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. If there are fewer than 500 disputes submitted, then each of them will proceed as cases in individual arbitrations at that time. Each of the cases will be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before an arbitration award is issued, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining disputes won’t be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those disputes. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall pay the mediator’s fee.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSTAGE TWO\u003c/strong\u003e: If the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, the same staged process set forth for Stage One will repeat for Stage Two with 500 total disputes proceeding in individual arbitrations except that arbitrators who presided over a case in Stage One may be appointed to preside over a dispute that proceeds as part of Stage Two, unless either party objects. After this second set of staged proceedings, counsel for the parties will participate in a global mediation to try to resolve all of the remaining disputes (including yours), and Scopely shall again pay the mediator’s fee.\n\nUpon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn will be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms. However, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the staged process set forth above (except disputes to proceed in any later stages will be randomly chosen and mediation will be optional) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.\n\nThe Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and may only proceed individually in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Changes to this Dispute Resolution Section\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIf we make any future changes to the Dispute Resolution Section (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice within thirty (30) days of the changes to:\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\nScopely, Inc. \u2028\nAttn: Chief Legal Officer\u2028\n3505 Hayden Ave.\u2028\nCulver City, CA 90232\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSuch written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration or the class action waiver.

An exception to this is our game STUMBLE GUYS, which allows younger players to play. As such, we take additional steps to limit access to certain features of STUMBLE GUYS based on players’ ages, and also limit the personal information collection and sharing of such younger players’ information to only what is necessary to support our internal operations.\n\nIf you are a parent or guardian of a minor, and believe that minor has uploaded personal information in connection with our Services without your consent, or if you wish to review information collected from your minor child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described in “Contact Us” below.

This right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to retain your information. (Note that if you request deletion of your personal information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose game progress or related Account information and access. If you decide to use or access the Services again, Scopely may consider this a new Account and may collect personal information associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)\n\n**Restriction or objection to processing:** to object to Scopely’s processing of your personal information, or request that Scopely restrict that processing. Because the information that Scopely collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal information, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this information. This right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the information. (Note that if you object to the processing of your personal information, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.) \n\n**Portability**: to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.\n\n**Request to be informed:** to request information about third parties with which your personal information has been shared.\n\n**Request review: **to review decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing if these decisions could affect your data subject rights.\n\nTo exercise these rights, please see “Your Rights and Choices” above.\n\nIn addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and processed certain types of personal information with your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time in the manner described when you provided consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.\n\nYou may have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, contact your local data protection authority. We will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved between you and us.\n\n*Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information*\n\nIf you are from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.

Your intention, the context, and the impact your words and actions have on other players all matter; \n\nWays to play respectfully:\n\n- Communicate in a way that builds, rather than disrupts the community; we want to make a community that is comfortable coming back, rather than drive others away\n- Use respectful language, even when in competition\n- Focus on the impact of words on others, not just your intention behind them\n- Learn from what bothers others, not just what you would be bothered by\n\nExamples of disrespectful behavior:\n\n- Bullying or harassing another player\n- Repeatedly contacting someone who does not want to communicate\n- Using hate speech or slurs anywhere in the game\n- For example, racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ+, religious intolerance, ableism (or targeting based on medical conditions), extreme political views, advocacy of hate organizations, and xenophobic statements\n- Using inappropriate or offensive names\n- Abusing, threatening, or encouraging for someone to hurt themselves or others\n- Sending inappropriate (e.g. violent, sexually explicit) pictures or communications in-game\n\n**PLAY FAIRLY - PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED**\n\nScopely games are created for each player to personalize their experience through their own playstyle and how they choose to engage with the features they like.\n\nGame rules exist to ensure fair play!

Sharing personal information may also be illegal in certain circumstances, and any breaches may be punishable by law.\n\nWays to play with integrity:\n\n- Keep your personal account information and unique player ID private and secure\n- Respect your own and others’ privacy\n- Share content that’s meant to be shared\n- Communicate only with other willing players within the game’s chat function or established platforms \n\nExamples of not playing with integrity:\n\n- Sharing others’ personal information, such as contact information\n- Impersonating other people or Scopely employees\n- Sharing or selling your account to others\n- Infringing on others’ intellectual property rights or personal content\n\n**PLAY OPENLY - BE WELCOMING TO NEW PLAYERS**\n\nA vibrant, global games community is one that is open to people of all backgrounds, abilities, nationalities, and interests, and all should feel welcome and included.\n\nNew players are joining all the time, and they look to their fellow players for advice, community, and examples to follow.\n\nWays to play openly:\n\n- Be welcoming\n- Be inclusive of new players from all backgrounds, such as those of a different race/ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, nationality, ability, and much more\n- Be helpful when talking to new players learning the game\n- Recognize that everyone comes to the game with different experiences\n\nExamples of not playing openly:\n\n- Lashing out at those who are learning\n- Bullying or belittling newer players\n- Driving players away from the game\n\n**PLAY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY - BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON OTHERS**\n\nWe encourage players to uphold these guidelines and communication practices across Scopely games and community channels, in addition to the rules in our Terms of Service and rules from particular games or channels. \n\nBehaviors against our Terms of Service may also lead to account consequences such as warnings, limiting access to chat functions, or suspending your account temporarily or permanently. \n\nIf you believe a player has violated our Terms of Services, you can reach out to customer support at https://scopely.com/customer-support/ to report it to us.\n\n\n\nScopely is proud to be home to millions of deeply engaged and passionate players worldwide who bring their diverse perspectives and experiences to our player communities. \n\nBy following our Player Community Guidelines, we can all work together to keep our communities safe, inclusive, and fun for all. \n\nThank you for playing!\n"}}],"id":"community-guidelines","subtitle":"**MODIFIED ON: MAY 16, 2022.**"}},{"name":"LegalSection","key":"dON3QCIpDxulrcRMxFelSfIRXlAdSx","props":{"menuLabel":"Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions","title":"Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions","subtitle":"RULES","items":[{"name":"LegalText","key":"URhx6DwBJBcUBqeV0iooaRJo4jHDXK","props":{"text":"\n**Scopely Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions:**NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT NECESSARY TO ENTER OR TO WIN A SWEEPSTAKES.

This strategy is reviewed and approved by UK senior leadership.\n\n**Risk Management and Governance**\n\nAs outlined in our Code of Conduct, the Group and its employees are committed to not only complying with all applicable laws and regulations, but also going above and beyond these standards to conduct our business in the most honest and ethical manner possible wherever operations are maintained.\n\nThis level of standard in the Code of Conduct is applied to our approach in managing tax risk and governance in the UK, and in all jurisdictions where the Group operates. We diligently monitor applicable tax laws and regulations to ensure that UK tax is paid appropriately and timely, tax reporting and disclosure requirements are met, and that tax risk is minimized.\n\nDue to the complexity and constant changes in global tax, we manage tax risks and uncertainty internally, but we also seek guidance from outside advisors to inform our decision making and strategy. Key tax decisions are made at the appropriate levels and in consultation with senior leadership.\n\n**Tax Planning**\n\nOur focus is to ensure compliance with applicable laws in keeping with our Code of Conduct, and that tax planning aligns with the natural state of business expansion and operating objectives. We seek guidance from external advisors as appropriate to navigate complex tax rules and minimize uncertainty in interpretation.\n\n**Level of Tax Risk**\n\nThe UK sub-group is part of a much larger global tax group, and therefore the level of tax risk is assessed as a global organization. The Group is focused on proactively assessing the relevancy and applicability of tax legislation to maintain low levels of tax risk or uncertainty of tax positions. External tax advisors are consulted as needed.\n\n**Engaging with HMRC**\n\nThe UK sub-group aims to have a professional, transparent, and collaborative relationship with the HMRC on all tax matters whether historic, future, or prospective."}}]}}]}}]}},{"name":"CustomerSupport","key":"GGMY3VB7vtD6SYUc0GMdKgsWU8355t","props":{"items":[]}},{"name":"Footer","key":"it2SaR1AWP8sMjR1RjNwJvTK9knpI9","props":{"image":{"name":"jryuMxAmsWclkND3deDf80FpuMRxrrFpaz6fpLmY.png","type":"image/png","size":{"width":566,"height":777},"originalName":"Sylvester.png","resizable":true,"quality":75,"sizes":[100,700,1400,2000]},"social":[{"name":"SocialItem","key":"LlE7YQCfWQhbHMS2CDXMBsO2GRCDgt","props":{"ctaLabel":"LinkedIn","ctaLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/scopely/"}},{"name":"SocialItem","key":"jDlNCdOivvqIJojnobbQeoP7M3uUqO","props":{"ctaLabel":"Twitter","ctaLink":"https://twitter.com/scopely"}},{"name":"SocialItem","key":"R2MBwhadHpw1QSNWLmiZy017rsDQUI","props":{"ctaLabel":"Instagram","ctaLink":"https://www.instagram.com/scopely/?hl=en"}},{"name":"SocialItem","key":"sF8eDcQGUTUtKfQDUfe2cfQTphDZUg","props":{"ctaLabel":"Youtube","ctaLink":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcmBiPkUWWCrwwuq_CPbW2Q "}},{"name":"SocialItem","key":"mwsMsfTpVcl1ej2ABAszqSLvvf9yS3","props":{"ctaLabel":"TikTok","ctaLink":"https://www.tiktok.com/@scopely"}},{"name":"SocialItem","key":"GyjCqZTD6wvyM6GSSwibC0p5u6l1Bt","props":{"ctaLabel":"Threads","ctaLink":"https://www.threads.net/@scopely"}}],"links":[{"name":"Link","key":"IHfCmu56BPnMtiftydk53rY1HwdXvc","props":{"ctaLabel":"Privacy Policy","ctaLink":"/en/legal?id=privacy"}},{"name":"Link","key":"kQMfC4UbwyU3PpGKF7zihTqj58ai77","props":{"ctaLabel":"Terms of service","ctaLink":"/en/legal?id=tos"}},{"name":"Link","key":"Ru9a3RKGX0ljkFZCVuzGm3M4vthZe2","props":{"ctaLabel":"Promotion terms \u0026 conditions","ctaLink":"/en/legal?id=promotion-terms-conditions"}},{"name":"Link","key":"b6fGmRKLW1fKO2D35VjgQICCkx8Zd3","props":{"ctaLabel":"Community Guidelines","ctaLink":"/en/legal?id=community-guidelines"}},{"name":"Link","key":"qCuLbkU37RjnW4rUUtYiIDjBCleUaw","props":{"ctaLabel":"UK Tax Strategy","ctaLink":"/en/legal?id=uk-tax-strategy"}}],"navigation":[{"name":"NavigationItem","key":"YdSdN3NnXzRYSrLUcISAigSeMuBvz5","props":{"ctaLabel":"Customer support","ctaLink":"/en/customer-support","image":""}}],"copyright":"© 2023 Scopely","itemsTitle":[{"name":"Title","key":"d3RVUBnX58OxaW7nnHAxqWu6fxjzOx","props":{"group":[{"name":"Group","key":"SmZC438wn4Px8AyvMvo38220Rc5pX6","props":{"itemTitleGroup":[{"name":"GroupItem","key":"2pshUNxCLjOTsxQKUW71ck5ivSdEYQ","props":{"text":"Get","style":"Solid","primaryColor":"FED330","secondaryColor":""}},{"name":"GroupItem","key":"HfZWDjq38yPGvUpf79aXmzMtPo4xFS","props":{"text":"in","style":"Outline","primaryColor":"0FF9C0"}}],"marginLeft":-1}},{"name":"Group","key":"hLHurKSNp8sCEG5K6RCtB6UeRzTFEX","props":{"itemTitleGroup":[{"name":"GroupItem","key":"pdM9tUEsMD5xTqKhg8nobj7Ymh2HDB","props":{"text":"Touch","style":"Solid","primaryColor":"FFFFFF","secondaryColor":"E03963"}}],"marginLeft":"15%"}}]}}]}}]},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/en/legal","query":{"id":"tos"},"buildId":"013gbK7I7rMJNPLgB3tpz","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[29934,64970,15264,68950,15027],"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
