<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Instacoins does not charge an explicit fee but uses its own Exchange Rate. The Exchange Rate is always shown in advance of the execution of each purchase order. You acknowledge your bank may impose additional fees depending on the method you use to fund such purchase, and that Instacoins is not responsible for any other charges other than the fiat amount you specify on our Website.</p>

<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies, involves significant risks. Prices can fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency, virtual or not, may be subject to large or sudden shifts in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. You should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding Virtual Currencies can be substantial.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Virtual Currency trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Currency is a unique kind of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank or government regulator that can take corrective measures to protect the value of the Virtual Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Instead, Virtual Currency is an autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders and market participants put their trust in a Virtual, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Thus, the value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Virtual Currency trading may be susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse relative to demand and supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Currency might collapse as a result of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for example, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent transactions from settling.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Transactions in the Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Due to the nature of Virtual Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could prevent the access or use of a Member’s Virtual Currency.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The abovementioned is not a closed list, there may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial standing and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading Virtual Currency.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The Company uses banking providers in order to receive your funds and to make payments. Our banking providers do not transfer Virtual Currency, exchange Virtual Currency, or provide any services in connection with Virtual Currency.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Markets for Virtual Currency have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner or illiquid. The Company does not guarantee any profit from trading or any other activity associated with the Website.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED RISKS, WHICH ARE NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER IF HOLDING VIRTUAL CURRENCY IS SUITABLE FOR YOU DEPENDING ON YOUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Reversals and Cancellations</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Instacoins reserves the right to reject any purchases or sale of Virtual Currency if we suspect the transaction involves or could possibly be involved in criminal activity, is a breach of our prohibited activities rules or any known legal, governmental or regulatory laws or orders.</p>
<p>In the event that Instacoins cancels a transaction, we are not required to reprocess your exchange on exactly the same terms as the terminated purchase.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Deposits, Withdrawals and Refunds</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Fees may apply to deposits sent to your own wallet. All fees will be outlined in advance of any transaction and are available elsewhere on our Website. Contact us should you have any questions regarding the cost of a transaction.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Instacoins is under no obligation to offer refunds (particularly where cryptocurrency has already been transferred) for any transaction or transacted funds. On the occasion that Instacoins does issue a refund, your monies will be credited back to your respective account within five to ten (5-10) business days. Kindly note that this may be subject to other delays by your corresponding bank. Instacoins reserves the right to charge a related refund or processing fee on such transactions. Please see our Refund and Cancellation Policy for more details.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Payment via Bank Transfer</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The company has a set minimum transaction volume or size threshold. For all transactions funded via bank wire (or for any other method where Instacoins receives fiat currency in advance from its clients), should the amount of fiat currency received be less than such minimum volume or minimum size threshold, Instacoins will not process the transaction and will not exchange such fiat currency into the equivalent in cryptocurrency. Please consult our FAQs for more information on the minimums stipulated for each currency.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>In order for Instacoins to process such transaction, you will be required to send additional Fiat currency to reach the minimum transaction size. Additionally, you will have to pay an administrative fee of one hundred Euro/Pounds Sterling/US Dollars (EUR/GBP/USD 100), or the equivalent of one hundred Euro (EUR 100) in any other currency. Should you have made the wire in error, no longer intend to purchase cryptocurrency or otherwise choose to request the Fiat currency back, we will levy an additional processing fee of one hundred Euro/Pounds Sterling/US Dollars (EUR/GBP/USD 100), or the equivalent of one hundred Euro (EUR 100) in any other currency as a processing fee.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Funding your account via bank transfer from third parties should be avoided. In the event we receive funds on your behalf from third parties we reserve the right to return the monies at the sender’s expense, and with no explanation, motivation or communication, and /or impose processing fees as described above.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>When making a bank transfer in a currency which is different than your native currency, it is highly likely that the amount we receive may be lower due to interchange bank fees. Please note these fees are not controlled or set by Instacoins and cannot be waived. In order to avoid this, always select the correct funding currency for your bank wire. We can accept payment via bank wire in EUR, GBP, USD, CAD, AUD, CHF, NOK and ZAR.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Skrill/Neteller Payments</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Where you send Fiat funds</strong> via Skrill/Neteller, Instacoins will receive such funds even in instances where the name and/or email of your Skrill/Neteller account does not match the name and/or email of your Instacoins account.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>When this is true, Instacoins will not be able to process the transaction since it would be classified as a third-party payment. In this case, Instacoins will send back the Fiat funds and <strong>apply a processing fee which shall be deducted from the amount being sent back</strong>. The fee applied will be 5.5% of the transaction value in fiat. Foreign exchange charges may also apply.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Skrill/Neteller may levy foreign exchange charges when you pay with a Skrill wallet denominated in a currency different from the one you selected on Instacoins.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Please note Skrill/Neteller is not available for clients located in the United States of America. Attempts to use this payment method by individuals located in the United States of America are not covered by this Policy and any associated risk or consequence will be borne by the client.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3>Open Banking Payments</h3>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Funding your account via open banking from third parties should be avoided. You should always fund your Instacoins account from a Revolut or Wise account you control. In the event we receive funds on your behalf from third parties we reserve the right to deny any eventual refund requests.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>These payment methods may not be available in all currencies and/or countries. Please consult our FAQs and support materials for the latest information.</p>
