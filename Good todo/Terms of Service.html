The Service costs $8.00 per month in blocks of six (6) months (i.e., the standard payment is $48.00). All charges are in U.S. dollars. If you do not cancel your account before the expiration of a six (6) month term, we will bill you for the next six-month term.</p>

Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes on this site. Such price increase shall not affect, however, those subscribers who have pre-paid for such period, and shall only take effect at the time of renewal.</p>

                                                <p>Account deletion: If you use the Cancel My Account feature, or if your renewal date passes without a renewal payment, your account and all associated data will be fully deleted after a "grace period," which allows users to renew their account data for a period after the renewal date. However, if you wish for your account data to be deleted more quickly, contact Creative Good via our Contact form at <a href="https://creativegood.com/contact/" target="_blank" class="highlight">https://creativegood.com/contact/</a> and request the deletion of your cancelled account. We will delete the account and all associated data from the goodtodo.com site, then confirm with you once it is done. Your data will also be deleted from our backup servers as they complete the full rotation of their rolling backups in several days. To delete your data from your local mobile device, simply delete the Good Todo mobile app from the device.</p>
