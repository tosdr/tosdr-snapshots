<h2>6. Maintenance</h2>

<p>Retrospring may perform maintenance services at any time. You acknowledge that such maintenance may require downtime, and contents or features on Retrospring may not load during this time as well as client functionality being disabled.</p>

<p>Retrospring requires occasional maintenances to improve, resolve, or update our service. These maintenances can take time, and can result in time without client functionality. We are not responsible for any loss of profile information or any other Content posted on the Service in these times.</p>

<h2>7. Copyright Policy</h2>

<p>Retrospring respects the intellectual property rights of others and  expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices  of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and  are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been  copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide  us with the following information: a physical or electronic  signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their  behalf; identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been  infringed; identification of the material that is claimed to be  infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be  removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information  reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; your  contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an  email address; a statement by you that you have a good faith belief  that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized  by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and a statement that  the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of  perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright  owner.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing  without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to  you. In appropriate circumstances, Retrospring will also terminate a user’s  account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
