Arbitration</strong></p><p>If either party requests to arbitrate any Claim (defined below) before an answer or dispositive motion is filed in a proceeding that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Service, the other party agrees to arbitrate such Claim. The party making the request (the ârequesting partyâ) must commence an arbitration proceeding within thirty (30) days of its request with either the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (âJAMSâ) or the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ). The parties agree that any such arbitration proceeding will take place in Wilmington, Delaware and hereby waive any objection that such venue is an inconvenient forum. The arbitration proceeding will be governed by the rules and procedures for commercial disputes of the arbitration organization to which the Claim is referred. Streamlined arbitration rules and procedures will be used if available. If for any reason the selected arbitration organization cannot, will not, or ceases to, serve as an arbitration administrator, the requesting party may substitute the other organization identified in this paragraph or another widely recognized arbitration organization that uses similar rules or procedures and is mutually acceptable to both parties. In the event of a substitution where the parties cannot agree on an arbitration organization, then either party may ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a qualified arbitration organization.</p><p>For purposes of this arbitration provision, âClaimâ means any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) past, present or future. The term âClaimâ is to be given the broadest possible meaning and includes any Claim arising from or relating to (a) your offer for sale and our acceptance for purchase of future receivables, (b) any transactions effected pursuant to these Terms of Service, (c) provisions of, or change of, or addition of, provisions to these Terms of Service, (d) collection of your obligations arising from these Terms of Service, (e) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements relating to these Terms of Service or any transactions between you and us pursuant to these Terms of Service, including any Claim regarding information obtained by us from, or reported by us to, credit reporting agencies or others, (f) disputes between you and us or our parent companies, wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, contractors, employees, officers, directors or representatives arising from any transaction between you and us pursuant to these Terms of Service, (g) disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision or these Terms of Service, or (h) these Terms of Service.</p><p>YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BY SENDING NOTICE OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT-OUT, ALONG WITH YOUR NAME, PHONE NUMBER, EMAIL ADDRESS AND MAILING ADDRESS, TO <a href="mailto:support@clearco.com">support@clearco.com</a> OR CLEARCO 548 MARKET ST #68100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, 94104.</p><p>IF ARBITRATION IS COMMENCED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO (I) HAVE A COURT OR JURY DECIDE THE CLAIM BEING ARBITRATED, (II) ENGAGE IN PRE-ARBITRATION DISCOVERY (THAT IS, THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER PARTY) TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT YOU OR WE COULD IN COURT, (III) PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN A CLASS ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, RELATING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION OR (iv) JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OTHER THAN YOUR OWN OR OUR OWN. OTHER RIGHTS AVAILABLE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. IF A CLAIM IS BROUGHT SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SECTION AND/OR THE SECTION TITLED âCLASS ACTION WAIVERâ ARE UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO THAT CLAIM (AND THAT DETERMINATION BECOMES FINAL AFTER ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED), THE CLAIM FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WILL BE LITIGATED IN COURT AND ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS SEEKING MONETARY RELIEF WILL BE ARBITRATED. IN SUCH A CASE THE PARTIES WILL REQUEST THAT THE COURT STAY THE CLAIM FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNTIL THE ARBITRATION AWARD PERTAINING TO INDIVIDUAL RELIEF HAS BEEN ENTERED IN COURT. IN NO EVENT WILL A CLAIM FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BE ARBITRATED.</p><p>Except as set forth below, the arbitratorâs decision will be final and binding. Only a court may decide the validity of items (iii) and (iv) in the preceding paragraph. If a court finally holds that items (iii) or (iv) are limited, invalid or unenforceable, then this entire arbitration provision will be null and void. You or we can appeal any such holding. If a court holds that any other part of this arbitration provision (other than items (iii) and (iv)) are invalid, then the remaining parts of this arbitration provision will remain in force. An arbitrator will decide all other issues pertaining to arbitrability, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration provision. The decision of an arbitrator is as enforceable as any court order and may be subject to very limited review by a court. An arbitrator may decide a Claim upon the submission of documents alone. A party may request a telephonic hearing if permitted by applicable rules and each party hereby consents to the other party participating by telephone. The exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Claim between the parties is permitted and encouraged. Either party may submit relevant information, documents or exhibits to the arbitrator for consideration in deciding a Claim. Unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and we each retain the right to bring an individual action in a small claims court having jurisdiction over claims not exceeding US$10,000 and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#x27;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p><p>For a copy of relevant rules and procedure, to file a Claim or for other information about JAMS and AAA, write them, visit their website or call them at: (A) for JAMS, 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, <a href="mailto:info@jamsadr.com">info@jamsadr.com</a> , <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">http://www.jamsadr.com</a> , or <a href="tel:1-800-352-5267">1-800-352-5267</a>; or (B) for AAA, 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019 <a href="mailto:websitemail@adr.org">websitemail@adr.org</a> , <a href="mailto:http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a> , or <a href="tel:1-800-778-7879">1-800-778-7879</a>.</p><p>If your claim does not exceed US$10,000, then any arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the rules of the selected arbitration organization.</p><p>If either party fails to submit to arbitration following a proper demand to do so, that party will bear the costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, incurred by the party compelling arbitration. The party initiating the arbitration will pay the filing fee. You may seek a waiver of the initial filing fee or any other fees incurred in arbitration. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU CANNOT PAY OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THE FILING FEE OR OTHER FEES REQUIRED TO INITIATE ARBITRATION, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, WE RECOMMEND YOU OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED ABOVE.</p><p>Except in the situation in which either party fails to submit to arbitration following a proper demand to do so, each party will pay for its respective legal representation (including attorneys), expertsâ and witness fees, regardless of which party prevails in the arbitration. A party may recover any or all expenses from the other party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. Allocation of fees and costs relating to appeals in arbitration will be handled in the same manner. For an explanation and schedule of the fees that apply to an arbitration proceeding, please contact the organizations at the addresses above. The appropriate fee schedule in effect from time to time is incorporated by reference into this arbitration provision. The cost of arbitration may be higher or lower than the cost of bringing a Claim in court, depending upon the nature of the Claim and how the arbitration proceeds. Having more than one Claim and holding face-to-face hearings can increase the cost of arbitration. Again, neither you nor we will be permitted to arbitrate claims other than an individual basis. An arbitration proceeding can decide only your or our Claims. You cannot join other parties (or consolidate Claims).</p><p>This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seq., as amended, notwithstanding any other governing law provision in these Terms of Service. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered and enforced, including by garnishment, attachment, foreclosure or other post-judgment remedies, in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitratorâs decision will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, in which case any party can appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the selected arbitration administrator. The panel will reconsider de novo (that is, without deference to the ruling of the original arbitration) any aspect of the initial award requested by the appealing party.</p><p>This arbitration provision will continue to govern any Claim that may arise without regard to any termination or expiration of these Terms of Service. If any portion of this arbitration provision (other than the provisions prohibiting class-wide arbitration, joinder or consolidation) is deemed invalid or unenforceable under the FAA, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this arbitration provision. If a conflict or inconsistency arises between the rules and procedures of the selected arbitration administrator and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision will control.</p><p><strong>18.
