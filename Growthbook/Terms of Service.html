Customer hereby grants to GrowthBook an unrestricted, non-exclusive right to use Customer Data, including for the purpose of training and improving GrowthBook&#x27;s artificial intelligence algorithms, in accordance with GrowthBook’s Privacy Notice and this Agreement, as GrowthBook deems necessary for offering, providing, and improving the Services.  However, GrowthBook will not retain, use, or disclose NPPI or any other personal information (as defined by applicable data protection laws) provided by Customer to GrowthBook hereunder for any purpose other than the specific purpose of performing the Services specified in this Agreement.  Customer authorizes GrowthBook to contact Customer for any lawful purpose, including marketing and sales.  Customer is required to request explicit user consent whenever the Customer is using Services to track data on Customer’s users.  Customer is required to add to the Customer’s privacy notice a clear clause that explains the data that is being tracked and the terms of using such data.
