<p class="static-p mgbot_20">Softpedia is a library of free and free-to-try software programs for Windows, Macintosh and Linux, video games and device drivers. Softpedia also contains a news section on technology and software topics.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
The services offered by Softpedia.com ("Softpedia" or "we") include the main website, a bilingual message board (forum), a "blog"-host, a photo store for users and any other features, content, or applications (collectively, the "Softpedia Services") offered by Softpedia or by related websites. The Softpedia services are hosted in Romania and the USA.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
This Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Softpedia Services. By using the Softpedia Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Softpedia Website) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with Softpedia.com). In fact, during the Registration process, the future Members can only get this privilege only after expressly consenting to comply with this Agreement. The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the Softpedia Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
If you do not agree with it, you should leave the Softpedia Website and discontinue use of the Softpedia Services immediately. Any further access from you to our website will be considered as an acceptance of the terms and conditions stated below.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
Softpedia may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon our posting on the Website. You agree to be bound to any changes to this Agreement when you use the Softpedia Services after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.</p>

<h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">
Softpedia Services' use, as well as Membership is void if prohibited. By using the Softpedia Services, you represent and warrant that:<br/>
a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate and you will maintain the accuracy of such information;<br/>
b) you are at least 13 years old (otherwise, for those who want to become Members, we shall need the parental direct consent). You may have your parent or tutor e-mail us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ccbba9aea1adbfb8a9be8cbfa3aab8bca9a8a5ade2afa3a1">[email&#160;protected]</a> to verify that you have been granted permission to use this site. Your profile may be deleted and your Membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under 13 years of age and you do not comply with the rules stated above;<br/>
c) your use of the Softpedia Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.<br/>
d) you are the developer or the owner of all software or any other content that you send to us.
</p>

<h3>2. Term</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Softpedia Services or are a Member.
Softpedia.com may suspend or terminate your Membership at any time, without warning, or may limit your access to the Website content, or to a part of it. Even after Membership is terminated, this Agreement will remain in effect. Once your Account is terminated you agree not to post on the message boards, or to assist or cause another person to post messages on your behalf.
</p>

<h3>3. Registering, passwords and responsibilities</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">
When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. We strongly recommend that you do not share that password to anyone. Moreover, you should remember to sign out or log off your account whenever you mean to interrupt the use of Softpedia Services, regardless of the duration of your absence. Also, it is advisable that you close the session window of your browser, especially if you accessed the Website from a public Internet cafe, for example. Softpedia will never ask for your profiles' passwords through unsolicited messages or e-mails.
</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
You agree not to use the account, username, or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to notify Softpedia immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your account.
</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
Unfortunately, no data transmission on the Internet can be 100% secure. Consequently, despite our efforts to protect personal information, Softpedia cannot ensure or guarantee the safety of any transmission whatsoever. You acknowledge that all information sent to us is on your own risk.
</p>

<h3>4. Intellectual property protection</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">

(3) Sufficient information to identify the location on the Softpedia site where the infringement took place (a list of URLs on site(s) controlled by SoftNews Net SRL);<br/>
(4) Clear statements in the effect of the complaining party having a good faith belief that use of the allegedly infringed intelectual property is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, and that the information in the request is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">
Softpedia will take into consideration, analyze and reply to all such requests or ask for additional information if the submitted requests do not comply with the above guidelines.
</p>
