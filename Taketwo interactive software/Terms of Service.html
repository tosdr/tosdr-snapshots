Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in the limited license granted in this Agreement authorizes the use of the Services (including the Content), Virtual Items, or your Account in any manner to develop, train, enhance, or provide source material for, or promote, any Generative AI Tools; and for the avoidance of doubt, any such uses are hereby explicitly prohibited. “<b>Generative AI Tools</b>” means any tool or computer program that uses algorithms or technology commonly known as artificial intelligence or machine learning to create or generate content such as, but not limited to, software code, written text, still or moving images, musical works, human voice emulation, audio material, or other creative works based on text, image, sound prompts, or other inputs. If we terminate your Account or this Agreement in accordance with the provisions below, any license from us to you to use the Services, Virtual Items, your Account, or any Content, ends immediately. </p><p><b>2.4 Legal Effect.</b> This license describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.

Virtual Items are licensed under the terms of this Agreement and nothing herein shall be interpreted as transferring any rights or ownership interest in such Virtual Items to you. Virtual Items are only available to users in certain locations, and, unless otherwise stated in your agreement with the relevant Digital Storefront, you may not purchase or use Virtual Items if you are not in an approved location. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for content made available through the Services, which is generally game-specific. Virtual Items have no monetary value, cannot be used outside of the Services, and may not be sold, transferred or redeemed for real money or items of value outside of the Services unless subject to separate, express written terms provided by Take-Two permitting such conduct. We have the right to modify, delete, move, remove, or suspend any Virtual Items at any time with or without notice to you and with no liability of any kind to you. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Items that may be held for any one game or that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. We may limit the period of time during which you may hold or use Virtual Items related to any particular game or other aspect of the Services. Additionally, the price and availability of Virtual Items to purchase or acquire are subject to change. You agree that you have no ownership or other rights in or to any Virtual Items or your Account.</p></div></div><div><div id="4-purchases-billing"></div><div class="css-1umsvo2"><h2><b><u>4. Purchases, Billing, and Subscriptions</u></b>. </h2><p><b>4.1 Digital Storefronts. </b>Some aspects of the Services and some Virtual Items may require you to pay a fee through a storefront operated by us or a third-party (each a “<b>Digital Storefront</b>”). Your contractual partner in providing these Services and Virtual Items to you will be the Digital Storefront. Your purchase through the Digital Storefront is subject to any applicable terms or conditions imposed by the Digital Storefront (“<b>Storefront Terms</b>”), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. <b> </b>You are responsible for all charges in relation to your purchase from such Digital Storefront and must provide accurate and complete payment information to the Digital Storefront. We may suspend or cancel the applicable Services or supply of Virtual Items if the Digital Storefront informs us that they did not receive full payment from you after reasonable prior notification, or if you obtain, or attempt to obtain, refunds in violation of the applicable Digital Storefront’s policies. Suspension or cancellation of the Services or Virtual Items for non-payment to the Digital Storefront could result in a loss of access to and use of your Account and any Content or Services. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no liability to you in the event that your access to any of the Services is terminated by a Digital Storefront as a result of your breach of their Storefront Terms. </p><p><b>4.2 Subscriptions. </b>Some aspects of the Services may be offered on a subscription basis with automatic, recurring payments at the start of each billing period (“<b>Subscription</b>”). We reserve the right to modify the terms on which such features are offered for purchase at any time on thirty (30) days’ notice. Please note some Subscriptions are offered subject to additional terms and conditions, which may modify the terms below. </p><p><b>(1)3 Purchase. </b>Subscriptions can be purchased from a Digital Storefront. To use a Subscription, you must: hold a valid entitlement to the product or service related to the Subscription; have a valid account with the Digital Storefront including a current, valid, and accepted method of payment registered to that account; and have an internet connection. The Digital Storefront will bill the applicable Subscription fee (and any applicable taxes) (“<b>Fee</b>”) to your chosen method of payment on each Subscription renewal date. After purchase, your Subscription(s) will activate, and you will receive access to the benefits associated with the Subscription listed at the time of your enrollment. </p><p><b>(2) Automatic Renewal &amp; Cancelation.</b> Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period. The Digital Storefront will charge your payment method for the then-current Fee unless you cancel your Subscription through the applicable Digital Storefront before your current billing period ends. You may cancel a Subscription at any time, which will prevent auto-renewal and terminate the Subscription at the end of your current billing period. If you cancel, you will continue to receive benefits until the Subscription terminates at the end of your then-current billing period. Please see the Storefront Terms for applicable refund policies, if any. </p><p><b>(3) Changes to Subscriptions</b>. The terms of any Subscription and the benefits included in such Subscription may change from time to time. Benefits changes may include altering or removing previously claimed benefits. Take-Two may also retire a Subscription at any time on no less than thirty (30) days’ notice. Any such changes will be updated on the Digital Storefront’s Subscription product page, and you may receive email notice from Take-Two and/or the Digital Storefront about any such changes before they occur. <b>Please read any notification of changes carefully. If you do not cancel your Subscription after receiving notice of a change to the terms of the Subscription – including the amount of the Fee – or the benefits included in the Subscription, then you will be deemed to have accepted those changes. Changes will go into effect upon auto-renewal of your Subscription or the date on which you otherwise explicitly accept any such changes, if earlier.</b></p></div></div><div><div id="5-user-generated-and-custom-content"></div><div class="css-1umsvo2"><h2><b><u>5.

INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.</u></b></h2><p><b>(1) Binding Individual Arbitration. </b>You and Take-Two agree that, if not resolved through the informal negotiation process described below, any Disputes between us shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the exclusions in Section 15.5(10), a “<b>Dispute</b>” means any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or related to the Services, including those related to the formation, breach, termination, enforcement, scope, validity, or applicability of the Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, or your rights under those agreements. All Disputes are subject to the Arbitration Agreement regardless of whether they arose before or after you accepted the Agreement. </p><p>The arbitrator – not a federal, state, or local court, or government agency – shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Disputes, including those related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, and any claim that all or part of the Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have authority to determine all threshold arbitrability issues, including related to whether the Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement are unconscionable or illusory; whether the Arbitration Agreement has been disaffirmed under applicable law; and any defense to arbitration including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. The arbitrator may award the same remedies as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy the individual Dispute at issue. </p><p><b>(2) Class Action / Jury Trial Waiver. </b> You and Take-Two each waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Disputes in any forum. You and Take-Two each waive all rights to participate in any purported class, collective, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. Unless you and Take-Two agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of consolidated, representative, group, or class proceeding. All Disputes shall be arbitrated on an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis only. This means that the arbitrator will resolve your individual Dispute with Take-Two separate from any other Dispute, and that your Dispute cannot be consolidated or joined with another person’s or party’s claims. The arbitrator may award relief permitted by applicable law only with respect to the individual party seeking relief, but to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, may not award relief respecting any person other than that individual party seeking relief. If any court or arbitrator determines that this Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Take-Two shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes. </p><p><b>(3) Applicability; Your Right to Opt Out. </b>This binding individual arbitration requirement will not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your country or state of residence. You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.

If you have a Dispute with us, you must send written notice of the Dispute (“<b>Notice of Dispute</b>”) to us at the following address: </p><p>Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. </p><p>ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — NOTICE OF DISPUTE </p><p>110 West 44th Street, </p><p>New York, New York, 10036 </p><p>To be considered complete, your Notice of Dispute must include the following information: (1) your name, (2) Account name or registered email address you use to access the Services, (3) your mailing address, (4) how to contact you, (5) what the problem is, and (6) what you want us to do about it. </p><p>If Take-Two has a Dispute with you, we will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us or, if these options are not available, to other reasonable contact information you have provided us. </p><p><u>Step 2: Informal Negotiation</u>. To help us get to a resolution faster and reduce the costs for both parties, you and Take-Two agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Dispute for at least 30 days. Those informal negotiations will start on the day you or Take-Two receive a written Notice of a Dispute.</p><p><u>Step 3: Binding Arbitration</u><b>. </b>If we cannot resolve the Dispute informally, the Dispute (except as set out in Section 15.5(9) and (10) below) will be resolved exclusively via binding individual arbitration conducted by the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.</a> (“<b>JAMS</b>”) subject to the terms in this Arbitration Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. </p><p><b>(5) Demand for Arbitration. </b>The party starting an individual arbitration must send JAMS a “<b>Demand for Arbitration</b>” (using the form available on its website), pay any applicable filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. If you have a Dispute with us, you must send a copy of your Demand for Arbitration to:</p><p>Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. </p><p>ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION </p><p>110 West 44th Street,</p><p>New York, New York, 10036 </p><p>Take-Two will send our copy of our Demand for Arbitration to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us or, if these options are not available, to other reasonable contact information you have provided us. </p><p></p></div></div><div><div id="16-governing-law-continued"></div><div class="css-1umsvo2"><p><b>(6) Individual Arbitration Procedure.</b> </p><p><u>Rules</u>. Individual arbitration between you and Take-Two will occur under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures issued by JAMS as of the date of the Notice of Dispute (the “<b>JAMS Rules</b>”) and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. Please see <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> for more information about JAMS and the JAMS Rules. You and Take-Two agree that the arbitration will be conducted in English and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Arbitration Agreement. </p><p><u>Discovery and Evidence</u>. Discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to the production of documents that are directly relevant to significant issues in the case or to the case’s outcome. The arbitrator shall make all determinations related to the admissibility or relevance of evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p><p><u>Dispositive Motions &amp; Hearing Location</u>. The arbitrator shall allow for dispositive motions. The location and method of the parties’ appearance at the arbitration proceeding, if any, will be determined by the JAMS Rules. </p><p><u>Confidentiality.</u> The arbitrator shall issue an order providing that the arbitration proceedings and all notices, pleadings, motions, discovery responses, testimony, and documents exchanged or filed related to such proceedings be kept strictly confidential. </p><p><u>Fees</u>. The parties will bear any arbitration costs as determined by the JAMS Rules. </p><p><u>Decision &amp; Award</u>. The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless otherwise agreed, any decision or award shall set forth the factual and legal basis for the award. The arbitrator shall be permitted to award only those remedies permitted by applicable law or in equity which are supported by credible relevant evidence as determined by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Unless Take-Two expressly consents, the arbitrator may not award relief against Take-Two respecting any person other than you. Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on the parties, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment.</p><p><b>(7) Time Limit for Claims. </b>To the extent permitted by applicable law, <u>if a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Take-Two must start arbitration of all Disputes within two (2) years of the events giving rise to the Dispute</u>. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two (2) years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Take-Two encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. <u>Failure to timely engage in dispute resolution will permanently bar all claims.</u></p><p><b>(8) Non-Arbitrable Claims. </b>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the arbitrator may not legally adjudicate or award a particular legal or equitable claim or remedy, such claim or remedy shall be stayed until all other claims and remedies are final and the arbitration completed. Thereafter, the remaining claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York and, if meritorious, such court may award the remaining remedy. To the extent any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, group, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims remaining in arbitration. In all cases described in this Section 15.5(8), the federal or state court shall be bound under the principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator. Suits brought in state court may be removed to federal court by either party if permissible under applicable law. </p><p><b>(9) Exception – Mass Arbitration Procedure. </b></p><p><u>Mass Arbitration</u>. A “<b>Mass Arbitration</b>” means 5 or more Disputes relating to the same or similar subject matter, which share common issues of law or fact, or in which the counsel or other organization representing the parties in such Disputes are the same, cooperating, or working in coordination. A “<b>Mass Arbitration Dispute</b>” means an individual Dispute that forms a part of a Mass Arbitration. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as authorizing a consolidated, representative, group, or class proceeding. Take-Two reserves all rights and defenses as to each and any Demand for Arbitration and claimant. </p><p><u>Rules for Mass Arbitration</u>. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to have all Disputes administered by JAMS on an individual basis, you and Take-Two agree that if your Dispute is (or becomes) a Mass Arbitration Dispute, it shall not be governed by the JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, Mass Arbitration Disputes shall be administered by New Era and governed by the New Era Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration Disputes are filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “<b>New Era Rules</b>”), and this Arbitration Agreement. The New Era Rules are available at <a href="https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/">www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures</a>. For clarity, the New Era Rules shall be modified by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. </p><p><u>Batching of Mass Arbitration Disputes</u>. To facilitate efficient resolution of Mass Arbitrations, after 60 Mass Arbitration Disputes have been accepted related to a single Mass Arbitration (the “<b>Initial Batch</b>”), New Era shall not accept any additional Demands for Arbitration related to such Mass Arbitration until 60 days after the final resolution of all Bellwether Cases from the Initial Batch and the subsequent Settlement Conference provided for under the New Era Rules. Thereafter, any additional Mass Arbitration Disputes related to the ongoing Mass Arbitration may be accepted and resolved under the New Era Rules on the same terms as if such Mass Arbitration Disputes had been filed and accepted as part of the Initial Batch. The delay in the acceptance of a Mass Arbitration Dispute under this provision shall be excluded when calculating the relevant time limit to bring a Dispute under this Arbitration Agreement. Take-Two and the party to any Mass Arbitration Dispute that would otherwise be delayed under this provision may agree to waive the delay and include such Mass Arbitration Dispute in the Initial Batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith to implement this batch-based process. </p><p><u>Severability for Mass Arbitration</u>. If any court or arbitrator determines that this Section 15.5(9) is void or unenforceable for any reason, or if New Era declines to administer any Mass Arbitration Dispute as a Mass Arbitration, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Take-Two shall be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate such Disputes. </p><p><b>(10) Exclusion from Arbitration.</b> Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through binding individual arbitration, you and Take-Two may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts any of the following claims: patent infringement or invalidity; copyright infringement (including, without limitation, based on use of the Services following a breach of, or termination of rights under, the Agreement); moral rights violations; trademark infringement; trade secret misappropriation; or computer fraud and abuse. Either party to a Dispute may seek relief in a small claims court for any individual Disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, including by seeking to have an arbitration pending under this Arbitration Agreement moved to such small claims court on this basis.<u> </u></p><p><b>(11) Limitation on Changes to Arbitration Provision.</b> We may update this Agreement, including the Arbitration Agreement, at our discretion in accordance with Section 1.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if Take-Two changes any of the terms of this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first accepted the Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement), you may reject the new changes. To reject the new changes to the Arbitration Agreement, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the effective date of the changes you seek to reject, as indicated by the “Last Updated” date above. Your rejection notice must be sent to: </p><p>Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. </p><p>ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — REJECTION OF CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</p><p>110 West 44th Street,</p><p>New York, New York, 10036</p><p>The rejection notice must include (1) your full name; (2) your mailing address; (3) your user account name, if you have one; and (4) a clear, signed statement that you reject the changes to this Arbitration Agreement. For clarity, if you previously accepted the Arbitration Agreement, your rejection of changes to the Arbitration Agreement <u>does not</u> mean that you opt out; you and Take-Two will still arbitrate any Dispute between you and Take-Two under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed or the effective date of the last version of the Arbitration Agreement you accepted (as indicated by the “Last Updated” date above), whichever is later. </p><p><b>(12) Severability.</b> Except as set forth in Sections 15.5(2) and (9), if any clause within this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that clause or portion will be severed, and the remainder of this Dispute Resolution section will be given full force and effect. </p></div></div></main></article></div></div><style data-emotion-css="1why38d-cssBackToTop-BackToTop-BackToTop">.css-1why38d-cssBackToTop-BackToTop-BackToTop{position:fixed;padding:0;cursor:pointer;border-radius:0.25rem;color:transparent;right:1rem;background:rgba(var(--color-black-rgb),0.8);border:none;-webkit-transition:background-color 0.2s ease-in-out,bottom 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.68,-0.55,0.265,1.55);transition:background-color 0.2s ease-in-out,bottom 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.68,-0.55,0.265,1.55);font-size:0;bottom:-4rem;}.css-1why38d-cssBackToTop-BackToTop-BackToTop:hover:not(:active){background-color:var(--color-primary);}.css-1why38d-cssBackToTop-BackToTop-BackToTop svg{width:2rem;height:2rem;padding:0.5rem;color:var(--text-color-primary);fill:currentColor;}</style><button type="button" title="Back to top" class="css-1why38d-cssBackToTop-BackToTop-BackToTop"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M8.12 14.71L12 10.83l3.88 3.88a.996.996 0 101.41-1.41L12.7 8.71a.996.996 0 00-1.41 0L6.7 13.3a.996.996 0 000 1.41c.39.38 1.03.39 1.42 0z"></path></svg></button></section></div><script data-cfasync="false" src="/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"title":"Take-Two Terms of Service","termsHeader":null,"termsBody":null,"termsAcceptButtonText":null,"termsDeclineButtonText":null,"termsDeclinedMessage":null,"titleTag":"Take-Two Terms of Service","preamble":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Take-Two Terms of Service","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-1"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Last Updated: January 29, 2024","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a global company headquartered at 110 W. 44th Street, New York, NY 10036, United States of America whose group includes all ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://www.take2games.com/labels/"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Take-Two entities and labels","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" (collectively “","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Take-Two","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":",” “","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"we","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":",” “","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"us","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":",” and ”","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"our","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"”).
