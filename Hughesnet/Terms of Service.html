Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms do not grant you any rights to, or in, any patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), or any other intellectual property rights.</p><p><strong>Termination/Suspension</strong></p><p>You agree that Hughes may immediately, in its sole discretion and without notice to you, terminate or suspend your account, any associated account credentials, and your access to all or any part of the Websites or change your password without notice. Cause for such termination, suspension, or change includes, but is not limited to: (a) breaches or violations of these Terms or other incorporated agreements or guidelines; (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies; (c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions); (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Websites (or any part thereof); (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems; (f) extended periods of inactivity; and/or (g) engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities.

You agree that all terminations and suspensions shall be made in Hughes's sole discretion and that Hughes shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination or suspension of your account, loss of storage, any associated email address, or access to the Websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Government Users</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the Website(s) or Content are being used or accessed by or on behalf of the United States Government, such use is subject to the following additional terms. The Website(s) and any related documentation are deemed “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, within the meaning of the applicable civilian and military Federal Acquisition Regulation and/or any supplement thereto. For purpose of any public disclosure provision under any federal, state, or local law, the Website(s) and the Content are a trade secret and a proprietary commercial product of Hughes and are not subject to disclosure. If the user of the Website(s) is an agency, department, employee, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Website(s) or Content, including, without limitation, technical data, manuals, or other accompanying documentation, is restricted by the terms, conditions, and covenants of these Terms. In accordance with 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 for civilian agencies and 48 C.F.R. § 227.7202, et seq. for military agencies, use of the Website(s) is further restricted by these Terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>These Terms of Use and all matters relating to your access to, or use of, the Website shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland. You agree that any legal action or proceeding between Hughes and you for any purpose concerning these Terms or the Websites or in any way related to the Websites shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Montgomery County in the State of Maryland. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to these Terms, the Websites, or Hughes must be commenced within six (6) months after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action shall be barred.&nbsp;Hughes may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you. Your rights and duties under these Terms are not assignable by you without written consent of Hughes. These Terms do not provide any third party with a remedy, claim, or right of reimbursement. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be considered severable from the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Hughes reserves the right to take all legal and technical steps available, including pursuing civil remedies and criminal prosecution, for any violation of these Terms. Hughes' failure to enforce these Terms in every instance in which it is entitled does not amount to a waiver of Hughes' rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Revised May 7, 2024</p></div>
