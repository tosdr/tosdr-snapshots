Where legally required, we will inform you about the use of such tracking technologies using so-called cookie-banners and/or obtain your consent to use such Tracking Technology.</p><ul><li><strong>How do these Tracking Technologies work?</strong> Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalization of the Services experience by saving your personal information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk (such as your computer or smartphone) for record-keeping purposes. Cookies store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has been placed, as well as information about the age of the cookie and a random alphanumeric identifier, the so-called cookie-ID. They help to recognize the device and make any pre-settings immediately available. Web beacons are small graphical images that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behaviour. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. Flash cookies are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity often use flash cookies.</li><li><strong>What information do these Tracking Technologies collect?</strong> These tracking technologies collect information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., IP address, pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Services such as opening an email, log files, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, etc.), and information about the device(s) you use to access the Services (e.g., unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (IDFA), Google AdID or Windows Advertising ID), device type, model and manufacturer, operating system brand and model and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data). We, or our third party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising and content displayed on another device so that we may recognize and contact you on the various devices you may use.</li><li><strong>What are Cookies and other Tracking Technologies used for?</strong> Tracking Technologies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our Websites are being used, helping us analyse trends, administering the Websites, tracking users’ movements around the Websites, gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. Tracking Technology can also help ensure that you see marketing content that is more relevant to you and your interests. Therefore, generally speaking, we use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website(s); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c)&nbsp;recognize and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage and demographic patterns on our Websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services.</li><li><strong>What types of cookies are used by Flexera?</strong> The types of cookies used on our site can generally be put into one of the following categories: Necessary; functional and advertising.

This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertising partners.</li></ul></li><li><strong>How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?</strong> The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or until they expire. The actual period of validity of each persistent cookie depends on each cookie. However, they generally expire within 3 months.
