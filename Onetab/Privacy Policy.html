  <h3>Privacy assurance</h3>

  <p>
    <b>The important part</b>: Information about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button.
  </p>

  <p>
    The remainder of this privacy policy includes the usual web-site privacy language that covers us more broadly to comply with privacy law. E.g. we need to disclose that we use technology such as Google Analytics
    to keep track of how busy our Site is. We take your privacy very seriously.
