<ul>
<li>a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>identification of the works or materials claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple works or materials on the 8tracks Platform are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works on the 8tracks Platform;</li>

<p>(b) 8tracks does not permit infringement of intellectual property rights on the 8tracks Platform, and 8tracks will remove all Content and User Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. It is 8tracks' policy to respond promptly to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA. In addition, 8tracks will promptly terminate without notice the accounts of Users that are determined by 8tracks to be "repeat infringers." A <b>repeat infringer</b> is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had a User Submission removed from the Website more than twice.</p>

<p>(c) <span>Designated Agent Contact Information</span>. 8tracks' designated agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at:</p>
<p><span>Via E-mail</span>: <a href="mailto:copyright@8tracks.com" target="_blank">copyright@8tracks.com</a></p>
<p>Via U.S. Mail:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Copyright Agent<br>
&nbsp; BackBeat Inc.,<br>
&nbsp; 200 Union Blvd., Suite 200<br>
&nbsp; Lakewood, CO 80228</p>
<p>(d) <span>Counter Notification</span>. If you receive a notification from 8tracks that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide 8tracks with what is called a "Counter Notification." To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to 8tracks' Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in paragraph (c), and include substantially the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</li>
<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>

<li>The subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which 8tracks may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 17.3 above or an agent of such person.</li>

</ul>
<p>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(e) <span>False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications</span>. The Copyright Act provides that:</p>
<p>[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [8tracks] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.</p>

<p>17 U.S.C. § 512(f).</p>
<p>8tracks reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement or counter notification in violation of the law.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the procedures set forth in this Section 17 should be sent to the Designated Agent at <a href="mailto:copyright@8tracks.com" target="_blank">copyright@8tracks.com</a> or to the postal address identified above. Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about 8tracks, the operation of the Service or any other matter should be sent to <a href="mailto:support@8tracks.com" target="_blank">support@8tracks.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>25. United States Export Controls</b></p>
<p>You agree to comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the United States Department of Commerce or other United States or other sovereign agency or authority, and not to export, or allow the export or re-export of any technical data or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or unless and until all required licenses and authorizations are obtained with respect to the countries specified in the applicable United States Export Administration Regulations (or any successor supplement or regulations). The transfer of certain technical data and commodities may require a license from an agency of the United States government and/or written assurances by you that you will not export such technical data or commodities to certain foreign countries without prior approval of such agency. Your rights under these Terms are contingent on your compliance with this provision.</p>

<p><b>26. Miscellaneous</b></p>
<p>26.1 <span>Notice</span>. 8tracks may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to 8tracks' terms and conditions, by postings on the 8tracks Platform, via electronic mail, or by U.S. Mail. Notice sent via e-mail will be deemed given twenty-four hours after such e-mail is sent, unless 8tracks is notified that the electronic mail address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the 8tracks Platform. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.</p>

<p>26.2 <span>Dispute Resolution</span></p>
<p>(a) <span>Mandatory Arbitration</span>. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND 8TRACKS AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> for more information about arbitration.</p>

<p>(b) <span>Commencing Arbitration</span>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice"), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to 8tracks, to you via any other method available to 8tracks, including via e-mail. The Notice to 8tracks should be addressed to: BackBeat Inc., 200 Union Blvd., Suite 200, Lakewood, CO 80228, Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the "Arbitration Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If you and 8tracks do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or 8tracks may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (the "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at <a href="tel:1-800-778-7879" value="+18007787879" target="_blank">1-800-778-7879</a>, or by writing to the Notice Address. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against 8tracks, then 8tracks will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon 8tracks' receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</p>

<p>(c) <span>Arbitration Proceeding</span>. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and 8tracks agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(d) <span>No Class Actions</span>. YOU AND 8TRACKS AGREE THAT YOU AND 8TRACKS MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.</p>

<p>(e) <span>Decision of the Arbitrator</span>. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.</p>

<p>(f) These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Only if the Mandatory Arbitration clause is deemed to be null and void, then all disputes arising between you and 8tracks under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you and 8tracks hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</p>

<p>(g) <span>Equitable Relief</span>. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which 8tracks seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of these Terms by 8tracks or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against 8tracks, including with respect to any User Submissions, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.</p>

<p>(h) <span>Claims</span>. You and 8tracks agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>

<p>(i) <span>Improperly Filed Claims</span>. All claims you bring against 8tracks must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.</p>
<p>All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, 8tracks may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that 8tracks has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

<p>26.3 <span>Waiver</span>. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of 8tracks to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>26.4 <span>Severability</span>. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p>26.5 <span>Assignment</span>. The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by 8tracks without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.</p>

<p>26.6 <span>No Agency</span>. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and 8tracks as a result of these Terms or use of the 8tracks Platform. You further acknowledge that by submitting User Submissions or other Content, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied or other relationship is created between you and 8tracks other than pursuant to these Terms.</p>

<p>26.7 <span>Survival</span>. The Sections entitled "Ownership; Proprietary Rights", "Audio Content", "User Submissions", "Password", "Indemnification; Hold Harmless", "Disclaimers; No Warranties", "Limitation of Liability and Damages", "Limitations by Applicable Law; Basis of the Bargain", and "Miscellaneous" will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

<p>26.8 <span>Headings</span>. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>

<p>26.9 <span>Entire Agreement</span>. This is the entire agreement between you and 8tracks relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. These Terms shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms or Guidelines made by 8tracks as set forth in Section 4 above.</p>

<p>26.10 <span>Disclosures</span>. The services hereunder are offered by BackBeat Inc., located at 200 Union Blvd., Suite 200, Lakewood, CO 80228, or by electronic mail at <a href="mailto:support@8tracks.com" target="_blank"><span>support@8tracks.com</span></a>.
