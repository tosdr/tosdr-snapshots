If You do not agree to any part, some or all of the contents of this GoPayLater Terms of Use, You may not use the GoPayLater service.</p>
    <p><br>This GoPayLater Terms of Use is an inseparable part of the Gojek Terms of Use: <a href="https://www.gojek.com/terms-and-condition/">https://www.gojek.com/terms-and-condition/</a>.</p>
    <p><br>
        <strong>1. GENERAL OVERVIEW</strong></p>
    <p>1.1. Unless specifically defined in this GoPayLater Terms of Use, capitalized terms used in this GoPayLater Terms of Use shall be interpreted in accordance with the terms in the Gojek Terms of Use and the Loan Agreement.</p>
    <p>1.2. Before using the GoPayLater service, You must agree to this GoPayLater Terms of Use and register through the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>1.3.&nbsp;When You:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>register for the first time as a prospective Borrower; </li>
        <li>sign the Loan Agreement; and</li>
        <li>make a Transaction using GoPayLater, </li>
        <p>You must read, acknowledge, understand and review the GoPayLater Terms of Use carefully and follow the applicable authentication and verification processes and steps.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>1.4.&nbsp;<strong>GoPayLater </strong>(<strong>or any designation thereof as PayLater</strong>) is a service in the Platform or Official Platform Partners which provides information technology-based loan facilities provided by the Lender(s) to the Borrower (“<strong>Loan Facility</strong>”) through Findaya as the P2P Lending Operator. It provides the following repayment options for the Loan Facility:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>by repayment of the Loan, including the Service Fees (if any) on the last day of the month in the respective month (“<strong>GoPayLater Akhir Bulan</strong>”); or</li>
        <li>by repayment of the Loan, including the Loan Interest (if any) through installments (“<strong>GoPayLater Cicil</strong>”) in accordance with the Payment Due Date in the Installment Period that You have agreed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(hereinafter, GoPayLater Akhir Bulan and GoPayLater Cicil are collectively referred to as “<strong>GoPayLater</strong>”)</p>
    <p>The terms set out in this GoPayLater Terms of Use generally apply to the use of GoPayLater Akhir Bulan or GoPayLater Cicil service (as relevant), provided that the Loan Facility for each of GoPayLater Akhir Bulan or GoPayLater Cicil will be subject to the terms and conditions agreed and further stipulated in each loan agreement depending on the GoPayLater service You use.
    </p>
    <p>1.5.&nbsp;The Loan Facility funds channelled to You as the Borrower to make a Transaction using GoPayLater are <strong>entirely derived from and owned</strong> by the Lender(s) registered on Findaya. Findaya <strong>only facilitates the provision of loan</strong><strong>from the Lender(s) by forwarding </strong>the Loan Facility funds to You as the Borrower. Therefore, any legal relationship arising with regard to the Loan Facility and the Bill shall be between <strong>You as the Borrower and the Lender(s)</strong> and all risks associated with the aforementioned legal relationship shall be the sole responsibility of You as the Borrower and the Lender(s).</p>
    <p>1.6.&nbsp;Your consent to the GoPayLater Terms of Use shall be deemed as and shall constitute Your application to obtain Loan Facility and any Transaction You make using GoPayLater (either the first Transaction or any subsequent Transactions) shall be deemed as and shall constitute a request to disburse the Loan Facility, and if the request is approved based on Findaya’s assessment, the Transaction Value will be deemed as Your loan amount channelled from the Lender(s) (“<strong>Loan</strong>”).
    ;</p>
    <p>1.7.&nbsp;You acknowledge, understand and agree that Findaya (for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lender(s)) reserves the right to conduct examination, verification, evaluation, assessment and determine (approve or reject) the application to obtain Loan Facility and Loan disbursement request for each Transaction made by You. For the avoidance of doubt, Findaya (for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lender(s)) or the Lender(s) has the right to determine that the granting of Loan Facility and Loan disbursement to You only applies for GoPayLater Akhir Bulan service and that Findaya or the Lender(s) shall not be obliged to provide the GoPayLater Cicil service to You, or vice versa. </p>
    <p>1.8.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that the Lender(s) may transfer or assign any outstanding Loan and Bill to other parties, including but not limited to banks, non-bank financial institutions or other financial institutions subject to the provisions of the Applicable Law and therefore this agreement and acknowledgement shall be binding according to the Applicable Law, and any such transfer or assignment will be notified to the Borrower via the Platform or by other means or methods of communication and within such period as determined by Findaya from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>1.9.&nbsp;You understand that Your failure to pay or repay the Loan may result in (i) collection activities being carried out by Findaya, the Lender or any other party appointed by Findaya and/or the Lender against the Borrower; (ii) the Borrower being reported to the Financial Services Authority (“<strong>OJK</strong>”); and (iii) adjustments to the Borrower’s creditworthiness record or rating at Findaya and/or Lender.
    </p>
    <p>1.10.&nbsp;You agree to the use of the Electronic Signature provided/facilitated by Findaya or other parties in cooperation with Findaya.
    </p>
    <p>1.11.&nbsp;Findaya will and may report to related parties, including but not limited to the OJK, PPATK and/or related institutions in the event that any of the information, data and statement provided by You is false or is in violation of or contravention with the Law.
    </p>
    <p>1.12.&nbsp;In the event that You obtain a Loan from a Lender who is a foreign citizen or foreign legal entity (a legal entity not established pursuant to the Indonesian Law), You shall comply with and be subject to the applicable Law with respect to obligations related to offshore debts (including but not limited to any reporting obligations to Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Finance, the Offshore Commercial Loan team and other authorized institutions).
    </p>
    <p>1.13.&nbsp;This GoPayLater Terms of Use, in part or in full, including any of its features or services may be changed, modified or added from time to time based on Our own policies with a Notification to You, either through a Notification or announcement on the Platform, electronic mail, Your phone number registered on the Application and/or other means of communication. You are deemed to agree to these changes when You continue to use the GoPayLater service after the date the changes, modifications and/or variations take effect.

    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>4.2. Limitation of Liability of Findaya</strong></p>
    <p>4.2.1.&nbsp;Findaya shall not be responsible for the completeness, accuracy, precision and correctness of any data, statement and information (including Information) provided or data uploaded by You and/or Lender, including but not limited to information on the use of the Loan.</p>
    <p>4.2.2. With due regard to the Applicable Law, Findaya shall not be liable for:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any indirect and immaterial loss, including costs, interest, damage or loss of any kind or nature (including personal injury, emotional distress and loss of data, property, income, profit, business, opportunity, use or other economic gains) suffered by You or a third party;</li>

    <li>Any loss, including expense, interest, damage or loss of any kind or nature (including personal injury, emotional distress, and loss of data, property, income, profit, business, opportunity, use or other economic gains) that occurs due to system failure of Official Platform Partners, the legality of goods and/or services provided in Official Platform Partners or Product Providers, as well as the safety and security of Your Transactions that occur in Official Platform Partners.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>4.2.3. Notwithstanding Articles 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 above, in the occurrence of an event that results in Findaya becoming liable to You for any legal or payment obligation in connection with the GoPayLater service and/or the GoPayLater Terms of Use, the amount of such payment obligation and liability shall not exceed the amount of Service Fees and/or Loan Interest (as applicable) paid by You in the period on which the event that results in Findaya’s payment obligation to You occurs.</p>

    </p>
    <p>4.2.5. Findaya is not the party that provides the Loan Facility to the Borrower. In this case, the Loan Facility provided to the Borrower only comes from the Lender where funds are channelled by Findaya based on the procedures and mechanisms as determined by Findaya. For the avoidance of doubt, the right, authority and power granted to Findaya by the Lender cannot, in any case and context, be considered or interpreted as a form of transfer of responsibilities and obligations from the Lender (including permits, licenses and certificates required to carry out its obligations) to Findaya. Therefore, the commercial relationship is between the Lender and the Borrower and You understand that Findaya is only responsible as an information technology-based fund-lending service operator that connects the Lender and the Borrower.</p>
    <p>4.2.6. Findaya does not provide any guarantee to You as to the certainty of the availability of Lenders who are willing to provide Loan based on Your funding request.</p>
    <p>4.2.7. You have read, acknowledged and understood and agreed to release Findaya from any and all demands, claims, compensation or other forms in connection with the failure of the loan provision.

    <p>4.2.8. The Platform may contain content provided by third parties as partners who cooperate with Findaya. You understand, acknowledge, accept and agree that Findaya will be released and shall not be responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, suitability, completeness or correctness of the services, content or products provided through these third party services. Findaya does not make any representations or warranties as to the services, content and/or products provided by third parties as partners who cooperate with Findaya.
    </p>
    <p>4.2.9. For every purchase of items, products and services from third parties or partners who cooperate with Findaya and that are available through the Platform or other Official Platform Partners, You are required to carry out due diligence on every item, product and service that will be purchased using the GoPayLater service.
