HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS</div><p><u>Exercising Right of Access, Correction or Portability</u>. We do not collect sufficient personal data to authenticate any particular user. As indicated above in<!-- --> <a href="#2">INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, HOW WE USE IT, AND WHY WE SHARE IT</a>, we only recognize a unique browser based on the Browser ID we assign to that browser for a particular Site. A Browser ID could therefore correspond to multiple individuals. Since the personal data we collect related to a Browser ID is not sufficient to verify that the corresponding browser belongs to the person making the request, we are not able to provide certain information in response to a request to know, access or port specific personal information about a user. This is to prevent anyone from using your browser to obtain your search or browsing history. We want to make sure your search and browsing history does not fall into the wrong hands.</p><p><u>Exercising Other Rights</u>: Residents of the EEA, UK, California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah can request to access, delete, restrict use of their personal data by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Click on the Browser ID button below to get your Browser ID and copy your Browser ID to a safe place so you can later send it to us.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, as permitted by the applicable laws of your country or state, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.</p><div id="5" class="privacy-policy-heading">5.

DATA HOSTED IN THE UNITED STATES</div><p>Ask Media Group is headquartered in California, and in order to access our Sites, your browser interacts directly with our Site servers in the United States. By visiting or using our Sites, your data is automatically collected, processed and stored on servers located in the United States. If you are located in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”), this means your data is stored in a country with laws that may offer less personal data protection than your country.

We retain information in our<!-- --> <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> <!-- -->system for up to three years to respond to discovery requests in the event of litigation or have the ability to defend legal claims.</p><p>We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.</p><div id="9" class="privacy-policy-heading">9.
