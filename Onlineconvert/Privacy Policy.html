                                            Inc. („Google“), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                                        <p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on

                                            you visited. Google Analytics may also use so-called web beacons (invisible
                                            graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on a

                                        <p>We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled (“anonymize IP”). This

                                            transmitted to one of Google’s servers in the USA and shortened there.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, we concluded a contract of order processing with Google for the use
                                            of Google Analytics (art. 28 DSGVO). Google processes the data on our behalf in
                                            order to evaluate your usage of the website, to compile reports about the

                                            website and internet usage. Google might transfer this information to third

                                        <p>By integrating Google Analytics, we pursue the purpose of analyzing the user
                                            behavior on our website and being able to react to it. This enables us to

                                            para. 1 lit f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for

                                        <p>Google AdSense is a Google service that displays Google advertisements from

                                        <p>Google reCAPTCHA serves to ensure that entries made on our website are actually

                                        <p>On our website, we use the open-source software Matomo (formerly PIWIK). Matomo
                                            is offered by Matomo.org. It is provided primarily by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis
                                            St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
                                        <p>Matomo is a web analysis tool which serves the analysis and evaluation of our
                                            website and its users. In particular, we utilize Matomo to log and analyze the
                                            surfing behavior of the users of our website.</p>
                                        <p>Matomo is exclusively executed on our servers (within the scope of our hosting
                                            contracts, we have concluded an SDV with the web hoster, so that all processing
                                            of data is exclusively bound by instructions and processed on our behalf only),
                                            so that the data is not disclosed to third parties, and the data processing
                                            takes place on our servers (in Europe) exclusively.</p>
                                        <p>The integration of Matomo takes place on our website by loading an appropriate
                                            java script and an image tracker. Likewise, Matomo sets a cookie to identify

                                        <p>On our website, we are using the Cloudflare service. Cloudflare is a service of
                                            Cloudflare, Inc., +1 (650) 319-8930, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107,
                                            USA, which also provides this service.</p>
                                        <p>Cloudflare is a so-called content delivery network which enables us to reduce the
                                            access time on our website. Our static data (e.g. images, CSS, JS) are hosted on
                                            servers by Cloudflare, whereby our data is transmitted to different Cloudflare
                                            servers at different locations. When accessing our website, the content is
                                            automatically downloaded and provided from a nearby server location. Therefore,
                                            you can regularly access the content of our website more quickly.</p>
                                        <p>It cannot be ruled out that, by doing so, data might be accessed by servers
                                            outside the EU (e.g. USA). Within the scope of an order processing agreement,
                                            Cloudflare processes your (personal) data on our behalf and according to our
                                            instructions.</p>

                                        <p>We analyze the success and reach of our newsletter (campaigns). At the same time

                                        <p>In the first step, you enter the mandatory data (e.g. e-mail address) and thus

                                            In the second step, you will then automatically receive an e-mail with a

                                        <p>The legal basis for the processing of further personal data is our legitimate

                                            Furthermore, we have legitimate interest in being able to prevent or prove
