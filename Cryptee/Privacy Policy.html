Let's begin. </p> <br><br> <p><strong>VISITING OUR WEBSITE</strong></p> <p> We have an analytics system. We didn't trust any third party ones. So we built one ourselves instead. It is 100% anonymous, and it's only there just to see how well we're doing with design, improvements, features and page views. </p> <br><br> <p><strong>ACCOUNT CREATION</strong></p> <p>We do not require ANY personal information. You don't even need to use an email. It's only for convenience. <br><br> Oh, and, legally we have to record the date and time of your sign up.</p> <br><br> <p><strong>Account activity</strong></p> <p>To provide you a service, we need access to some basic things in unencrypted format. These are:</p> <br><br> <ul class="tags"> <li>folder colors & archive status</li> <li># of things in each folder or album</li> <li>file byte-sizes & mime-types after encryption</li> <li>version-IDs of files, photos &amp; videos</li> <li>EXIF dates of photos</li> <li>storage space used</li> <li>all payment amounts &amp; dates</li> <li>payment type, plan &amp; discounts</li> </ul> <br><br> <p>If you choose to upload RAW photos (such as DNG, TIFF, 3FR or FFF formats) to provide you the service, we need access to some basic EXIF data in unencrypted format.

Our abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, but these are deleted once they're no longer relevant.</p> <br><br> <p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p> <p>We rely on awesome and trusty companies called Stripe and Paddle to process your payments, and we use your anonymous user ID to know / track when you paid.</p> </div> <div class="legal" aria-disabled="true"> <small> Our policy is to collect as little user information as possible to ensure a completely private and anonymous user experience when using the Service. We also have no technical means to access the contents of your encrypted data, documents, photos or videos. Service's user data collection is as follows: <br><br> <strong>Visiting our website</strong> <br><br> The Service employs an analytics software created specifically by the Company, and not a 3rd party analytics solution to further improve security, privacy and anonymity. Using this solution we may at times track usage metrics, design improvements and track new features' adoption on our pages completely anonymously, without collecting any identifiable pieces of information. These pieces of information are only collected in each unique session, without storing any trackers on the users' devices longer than each session, without tracking across sessions, with the sole purpose to improve our features, improve user experiences, increase new feature adoption and write better tutorials to guide our users. <br><br> <strong>Account creation</strong> <br><br> We do not require ANY personal information to create an account but you may provide an email address for login and password recovery purposes. Should you choose to provide it, we do associate these information with your account (to be able to provide you the Service). We will also store your account creation time. <br><br> <strong>Account activity</strong> <br><br> To provide you the Service, we have access to the following metadata: folder colors &amp; archive statuses, number of documents/files/photos/videos in each folder or album, file byte-sizes &amp; mime-types after encryption, generation/version identifiers for each document/file/photo/video (to prevent version conflicts between your devices), EXIF dates of photos (to help you sort / find photos based on when they're taken), amount of storage space used, payment activation and deactivation dates, first payment date, all payment amounts, upcoming and past payment dates, subscription plan associated with your account, whether a discount was applied or not, payment time and the type of the payment method used.<br><br>If you choose to upload RAW photos (such as DNG, TIFF, 3FR or FFF formats) to provide you the service, we need access to some basic EXIF data in unencrypted format. These are: Camera Make &amp; Model (i.e. "Leica M11"), Camera's Lens (i.e. "35mm"), Aperture, Exposure, White Balance and ISO.<br><br>We do NOT have access to the contents of encrypted photos, videos or documents/files. We do NOT have access to any specific payment information. More information regarding payments related information is below. <br><br> <strong>Communicating with the Company</strong> <br><br> Your communications with the Company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff, to improve our service and knowledge base featuring frequently asked questions. <br><br> <strong>Error Reporting &amp; Abuse Detection</strong> <br><br> Should an error occur while you're using the Service, depending on the error, our automatic error collection and reporting system may collect your unique user ID while reporting the error to our error collection system. (processed via Sentry IO, contact details &amp; privacy policy below) These collected Errors are automatically linked to our support system, and can be used to further clarify / investigate issues. These error reports are only retained for 90 days. We do not, and can't collect any personal / identifiable information with our error collection system. Our system may collect information like : (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, and (6) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of errors or attacks on our systems. Our abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, however these are deleted once they are no longer relevant. <br><br> <strong>Payment Information</strong> <br><br> The Company relies on third parties to process payments, so the Company necessarily must share your user identification number with the payment processor to be able to know which account the payment will be applied to. We do not otherwise store any of your payment information. Payments of users who subscribed to a paid plan after February 21, 2021 are processed by Stripe.com, 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, and the merchant of record is The Company. Payments of users who subscribed to a paid plan before February 21, 2021 are processed by Paddle.com, Market Ltd, 15 Bermondsey Square, SE1 3UN London, United Kingdom, as merchant of record. As the payment process is entirely and independently carried out by Stripe.com or Paddle.com, you submit the relevant payment data, especially your payment details and your email address, directly to Stripe.com or Paddle.com. You can find their Privacy Policy at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">stripe.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://paddle.com/legal">paddle.com/legal</a>. In order to comply with credit card processing requirements, the Service includes third-party javascript from Stripe that may contain other tracking. However, this content is only loaded on the payment page. The use of your data by Paddle.com is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point b of GDPR. Furthermore, Paddle.com allows the Company to access the following payment data: Your email address, your payment method (e.g. by credit card), but not the payment details itself, in order to obtain an overview over the Service's performance. This use is based on Art. 6 subpara. 1 point of GDPR, while the legitimate interest of Paddle.com is to transparently communicate its sales of the Service to the Company; the legitimate interest of the Service is to know about its revenues generated by Paddle.com. The user, data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from Paddle. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing. </small> </div> <p class="full bold center" id="data-use"> DATA<br>USE </p> <p class="lowercase"> We don't &amp; won't have ads.

Therefore even if a user is not signed out, their files would be encrypted and inaccessible without re-entering this key after reloading the page or navigating away from it.<br><br> We also have a script that regularly deletes all cookies on each page load.
