If you purchase a Paid Service through a third party, you acknowledge that separate terms with such third party, in addition to the Agreements, may apply.

If you purchase a Subscription, you authorize the respective third party to charge you on behalf of Windy for each respective recurring interval until you cancel.</p></li><li><p>Windy may change the prices for the Paid Services from time to time. For existing users of the given Paid Services, the price changes will take effect at the start of the next period of the Subscription following the date of the price change. You accept the new price by continuing to use the respective Paid Service after the price change takes effect. In the case of price changes for Subscriptions, Windy will, on its own behalf or through the respective third party through which you purchased the Subscription, notify you in advance of any price changes and, if applicable, instruct you on how to accept these changes. If you do not agree to the price changes or take the prescribed action, your Subscription will expire at the end of its current recurring period and will not automatically renew.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Trials</strong></p><ol><li><p>We may offer trials for certain Paid Services for specified periods without payment (a “<strong>Trial</strong>”).

If you do not want to accept this charge, you must cancel the applicable paid Subscription through the third party according to their terms of service.</p></li><li><p>We reserve the right to determine your eligibility for a Trial and withdraw or modify such Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Right of withdrawal for consumers</strong></p><ol><li><p>The following provisions of this Article 3.4 only apply to those Users who are consumers in terms of the applicable legislation for the protection of consumers and the extent to which the right of withdrawal from the given Paid Service is granted to them under such legislation.</p></li><li><p>If you register for a Subscription, or make a one-time purchase, you may change your mind for any or no reason and withdraw from the relevant Paid Service within 14 days from the day you sign up for the Subscription, or make the purchase (the “<strong>Withdrawal Period</strong>”).</p></li><li><p>By signing up for a Subscription, or making a one-time purchase, you explicitly request us to start providing the respective Paid Service to you immediately and, therefore, before the end of the respective Withdrawal Period.</p></li><li><p>You may withdraw from the Subscription, or from the one-time purchase, by canceling it through the third party through which you signed up for the Subscription, according to their terms of service, or, if the cancellation through such third party is not possible, by contacting us at <a href='mailto:info@windy.com'>info@windy.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you withdraw from a Subscription, or from a one-time purchase, within the Withdrawal Period, we will refund you any prepaid fees for the remainder of the relevant period calculated from the moment of such withdrawal.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Subscription renewal, Cancellation</strong></p><ol><li><p>Your payment schedule with the third party through which you purchased the Paid Service will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period.
