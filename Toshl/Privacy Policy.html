In accordance with our beliefs, we make great effort to ensure the transparency of the methods with which we process your data and how we ensure it is kept secure and confidential. We value your privacy and will never sell your personal information to anyone.</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy describes in greater detail the privacy practices of Toshl, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (âus,â âwe,â âourâ) responsible for collecting and maintaining certain information collected about you.</p><p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="https://support.toshl.com/" target="_blank">support.toshl.com</a>.</p><ol><li><p><span class="size-20">WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES. If a Service youâre using links to this Privacy Policy, this Policy applies to you.</span><br><br>This Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, âServicesâ) that link to this Policy. Toshl, Inc. is the responsible entity for all Personal Information subject to this Privacy Policy for our Services.</p></li><li><span class="size-20">WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, improve your financial life, operate our business, and help make our Services work better for you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent.</span><ol><li><p><strong>Types of Information We Collect.</strong> In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you (âPersonal Informationâ), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.<br><br>We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, use a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third-party account or service with your Toshl Service, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.<br><br>We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services (âUsage Dataâ), such as Internet Protocol (âIPâ) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services. We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.<br><br>We may also collect image data if the customer requests so while using the services. Images may be added by the customer on individual entries and uploaded to Toshl servers for backup and syncing with other customerâs devices where Toshl apps are installed and logged in with the same customer account. The images are used for no other purpose than to provide services to user. Images can be exported or deleted by the user at any time. Storage of the images on the servers is further covered in article 2.4.<br><br>Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.</p></li><li><p><strong>How We Use Your Information.</strong> We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:<br><br><u>Account Registration.</u> We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register your Toshl Account for certain Services we provide and to communicate important information to you. We may obtain additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available sources, to keep our records current.<br><br><u>Communicate with You and Tell You About Other Services.</u> We may use your information to communicate with you about our Services and to give you offers for third party products and services that we think may be of use to you.<br><br><u>To Improve Services and Develop New Services.</u> We will use your information to personalize or customize your experience and the Service, develop new features or services, and to improve the overall quality of Toshlâs Services.<br><br><u>To Provide Our Services and Operate Our Business.</u> We may use your information to operate our business, including providing Services you requested, provide you with support related to our Services, and to help us protect our Services, including to combat fraud and protect your information.<br><br><u>Customer Service and Technical Support.</u> We may use your name, address, phone number, email address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your mobile device or computer configuration to resolve questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience.<br><br><u>Feedback.</u> We may use any information you volunteer in surveys you answer for us and combine them with answers from other customers in order to better understand our Services and how we may improve them. Answering any survey is optional.<br><br><u>Research, Including Publishing or Sharing Combined Information from Many Users, But Only in a Way that Would Not Allow You or Any Other Person to be Identified.</u> Only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified, we may prepare and share information about our customers with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes. For example, we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use a particular operating system. We or our third-party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Log in</strong> When you log in to your Toshl account, we will collect certain information for security purposes in order to verify your authorized access to an account or to reset your password if you cannot access your Toshl account. Some Services may require added security and you may be asked to provide additional information. The email address and password that you use to sign up for a Toshl account are your âcredentialsâ that you will use to authenticate with our network. We assign a unique ID number to your credentials to track you and your associated information.</p></li><li><p><strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong> From time to time, we may need to share your Personal Information with others.<br><br><u>Third Party Service Providers.</u> We may share your information, including Personal Information and Usage Data, with third party service providers who perform various functions to enable us to provide our Services and help us operate our business, such as website design, sending email communications, fraud detection and prevention, customer care, or performing analytics. Our contracts with these third parties require them to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information we provide to them, only act on our behalf and under our instructions, and not use Personal Information for purposes other than the product or service theyâre providing to us or on our behalf.<br><br>Most of these services will not receive any personal information unless the user activates a particular feature that requires the third party service to function. Where possible, data is pseudo-anonymized, meaning that while a unique id is present, it cannot be linked to particular personal information by the third party service provider.<br><br>Third party service providers we use on Toshl with their respective Privacy Policies and Terms of Service.<br><br><a href="https://www.adyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Adyen</a> - provides various credit card and bank transfer payment options when upgrading to paid Toshl products on the Toshl website.<br><br><a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Amazon AWS</a> - Simple Email Service (SES) for sending Toshl emails.
