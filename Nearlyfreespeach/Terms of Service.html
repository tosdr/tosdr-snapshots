<h3 id="awareness">AWARENESS OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<p>
    NFSN, Inc. ("NearlyFreeSpeech.NET" or we/us) provides certain content-hosting services ("Services") to you, subject
    to these Terms and Conditions of Service ("TACOS"). The TACOS apply to your use of our service whether or not you
    like TACOS, and whether or not you take the time to fully digest them.</p>

<p>We may change these TACOS or make new TACOS at any time. Although
    we will attempt to notify you through reasonable means when
    the TACOS change, we are under no obligation to do so.</p>

<p>The freshest TACOS will always be available at
    <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/terms">https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/terms</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="registration">REGISTRATION</h3>
<P>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET memberships are held by individuals. This has three
    important consequences:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>You may only have one membership.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You may not create a membership for anyone other than yourself.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No one but you may access your membership.</strong> (It may not be shared, delegated or transferred.)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide accurate, complete, and current information about
    yourself as needed for registration and payment ("Registration Information").
    In the event of a change, you must promptly update the Registration Information
    to ensure that it remains accurate, complete, and current.</p>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET will handle Registration Information in
    accordance with a published privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") available at
    <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/privacy">https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/privacy</a>.
</p>

<p>To provide anonymous hosting, we may, at our sole discretion, waive
    in advance in writing part or all of the requirement to provide or
    maintain Registration Information.</p>

<h3 id="refunds">REFUNDS</h3>

<p>We want you to be happy with our service. However, we understand that it
    is not for everyone. We offer a very flexible refund policy in keeping
    with our belief that you should be able to try things out without taking
    a big risk.</p>

<p>We will refund the unused balance of your account(s) and close your
    membership at any time upon request. However, if you have registered
    domains through us, you must transfer them elsewhere or abandon them
    prior to requesting cancellation.<p>

<p>We typically issue refunds through the same method that you used to pay.
    If this is not possible (e.g., due to time limits on refunds imposed by
    our payment processors), we will try
    to offer you a variety of refund options, some of which may carry a fee
    based on the cost.</p>

<p>If issuing a refund would cost more than the amount of the
    refund, your remaining balance will be considered a non-refundable
    credit.</p>

<h3 id="nonrefundable">NON-REFUNDABLE CREDIT</h3>

<p>There are certain actions you can take, such as transferring an account
    (see <a href="#transfers">TRANSFERS</a> below) to another member,
    that will convert your balance into a non-refundable credit. Also, we
    may offer incentives or bonuses in the form of non-refundable credits.</p>

<p>Non-refundable credits cannot be refunded (hence the name). If you have
    a nonrefundable credit in your account when you close it, you may designate
    a website hosted by our service belonging to another member. We will
    transfer the nonrefundable credit to the account funding that website.</p>

<p>We will not ordinarily convert any balance to a nonrefundable credit
    except as needed to fulfill your requests. Before we do so, we will
    prominently notify you that your request will affect your eligibility
    for a refund and we will obtain your consent.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances (except as required by law) will we ever
    accept money from one party and pay it out to another party.</p>

<h3 id="transfers">TRANSFERS</h3>

<p>You and another member may jointly request that we transfer an
    account from your membership to theirs. We will be happy
    to do so, however the balance becomes a non-refundable credit
    (see <a href="#nonrefundable">NON-REFUNDABLE CREDIT</a> above).</p>

<p>You and another member may jointly request that we transfer some
    or all Services (sites, domain names, MySQL servers) from an
    account under your membership to another account under the
    recipient's membership. The recipient's account must be funded.
    We generally require that related items stay together (such as a site
    and its domain name, if applicable).</p>

<p>You may, under some circumstances, transfer funds to another member's
    account. Funds transferred in this way become nonrefundable.</p>

<h3 id="donation">DONATION DEPOSITS</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, we may allow you to accept deposits
    into your account from third parties through our
    service. Such deposits are non-refundable. We call these payments
    "donations" in keeping with the spirit behind offering the feature, but
    they are not considered charitable givings, nor are they tax-deductible.
    If you choose to accept transfers or donations from third parties,
    additional terms and conditions apply.</p>

<h3 id="payment">PAYMENT PRACTICES</h3>

<p>We charge your payment method only at your request and only with your
    authorization. If you submit a payment method as payment, you warrant
    to us that you have provided true and accurate information and
    that you are fully authorized to use that payment method.</p>

<p>As described under <a href="#refunds">REFUNDS</a>,
    we have a very flexible refund policy.
    Therefore, there should be no reason to ever file a chargeback or dispute.
    We investigate all such requests as potential fraud, and are required
    to freeze all affected accounts while the
    investigation is in progress. Because of the time and expense incurred
    in responding to a chargeback request, we charge a fee of up to $25.00 per
    occurrence. This fee will be waived if we find the chargeback is
    legitimate or due to an error on our part.</p>

<p>We do not keep credit card information above and beyond the minimum
    amount necessary (your name, billing address, and the last four digits of
    the card number) to identify transactions. This means we can never charge you
    for other transactions unless you explicitly log in and provide your card
    information.</p>

<p>Should you commit payment fraud of any kind in conjunction with
    our service, we will wreak dreadful vengeance upon you to the fullest
    extent of the law.</p>

<h3 id="tcontent">CONTENT</h3>

<p>You are solely responsible for any and all information, literature,
    software, works of art, or any other materials ("Content") you
    make available using the Services.</p>

<p>You may not upload, publish, or otherwise use the Services to make
    available any Content that:

<ul>
    <li>violates the laws of the United States of America; or</li>
    <li>you are contractually prohibited from distributing; or</li>
    <li>is tortious under the laws of the United States of America; or</li>
    <li>your distribution of which infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others; or</li>
    <li>you otherwise do not have the legal right to distribute.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conduct">CONDUCT</h3>

<p>You may not:</p>

<ul>
    <li>impersonate or falsely represent affiliation with NearlyFreeSpeech.NET,
        its employees, owners, or contractors; or
    </li>
    <li>engage in any activity that would cause NearlyFreeSpeech.NET to be
        in violation of the terms of service it obtains from other parties; or
    </li>
    <li>interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Services, or equipment
        used in providing the Services; or
    </li>
    <li>allow any other individual to use your NearlyFreeSpeech.NET username
        and password to access our systems; or
    </li>
    <li>verbally abuse, harass, or threaten NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, its
        employees, owners, or contractors.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>We may provide a variety of ancillary services from time to time for
    the express purpose of facilitating your ability to upload and manage
    your Content. You may not use said ancillary services (including but
    not limited to ssh access) for any other purpose.</p>

<h3 id="international">INTERNATIONAL USE</h3>

<p>It is your sole responsibility to ensure your compliance with any
    and all applicable local laws regarding online conduct and
    acceptable Content.</p>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET will generally cooperate
    with foreign authorities in the investigation or prosecution of
    alleged criminal activities. There is one important exception to
    this policy. We will generally not help authorities of any repressive
    foreign government to investigate or prosecute alleged criminal
    activities if (and only if) the scope of those activities is limited
    to the operation of a website on our service that is critical of
    that government in a manner that would be Constitutionally protected
    speech in the United States.</p>

<p>This exception is granted on a case-by-case basis. You should not
    assume you have this protection unless we have told you in writing
    that you do, in conjunction with an anonymous hosting arrangement.
    You should not bet your life or your family's life on our ability
    to protect you. Under no circumstances will this protection extend
    to non-speech-related criminal activity.</p>

<h3 id="indemnity">INDEMNITY</h3>

<p>You indemnify and hold harmless NearlyFreeSpeech.NET and its
    subsidiaries, affiliates, owners, officers, directors, agents,
    partners, employees, and contractors from any and all claims, demands, losses,
    causes of action, damages, lawsuits, and judgments, including attorneys' fees
    and costs, arising out of or relating to your Content, your use of the
    Services, or your activities in conjunction with the Services.</p>

<h3 id="modifications">MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES</h3>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET reserves the right at any time to modify or
    discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any portion
    thereof with or without notice.</p>

<h3 id="security">SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT</h3>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET makes a good faith effort to provide the Services
    in a reliable and consistent fashion. No guarantee is made as to the
    availability of Content at a particular time or the persistence of
    Content. Similarly, NearlyFreeSpeech.NET makes a good faith effort to
    ensure the security of your Content but cannot guarantee it will
    remain secure. It is your sole responsibility to secure your Content
    and to restore it in the event of a system failure.</p>

<h3 id="termination">TERMINATION</h3>

<p>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET reserves the right at any time and for any reason,
    including but not limited to your violation of these TACOS, to
    limit, suspend, or terminate your use of the Services and to discard
    any of your Content. Such termination of your use of the Services may
    be performed without prior notice, and NearlyFreeSpeech.NET may
    immediately deactivate or delete your Content and all related files
    relating to the Services and/or bar all access to the same.
    NearlyFreeSpeech.NET will not be liable to you or to any third
    party for any termination of your access to Services.</p>

<p>If NearlyFreeSpeech.NET terminates your service because you
    violated our TACOS, we may retain some or all of any balance
    remaining in your account as liquidated
    damages. You will remain liable for any additional damages you
    cause NearlyFreeSpeech.NET by your violation of these TACOS.
    Please respect our TACOS.

<h2 id="liability">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<P>

    <b>NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, including but not limited to its officers,

        funds contained in your account(s) that have not been disbursed or

<P>

<h3 id="exclusions">EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</h3>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties
    or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or
    consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above may not apply
    to you.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for any and all fees associated with
    obtaining access to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET and associated Services.</p>

<h3 id="notice">NOTICE</h3>

<p>Notices to you may be made through regular mail, electronic mail, via
    the NearlyFreeSpeech.NET website, or during the normal course of
    providing the Services.</p>

<h3 id="general">GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>These TACOS constitute the entire agreement between you and
    NearlyFreeSpeech.NET. The TACOS govern your use of the Services, superseding
    any prior agreements between you and NearlyFreeSpeech.NET including but not
    limited to any prior versions of the TACOS. The TACOS and the relationship
    between you and NearlyFreeSpeech.NET shall be governed by the laws of the
    State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The
    failure of NearlyFreeSpeech.NET to exercise or enforce any right or provision
    of the TACOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
    any provision of the TACOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
    be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor
    to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision,
    and the other provisions of the TACOS remain in full force and effect.
    Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
    action you have arising out of or related to your use of the Services
    must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action
    first arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the TACOS are for
    clarity only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>

                        and easier to understand and to reflect how our business has evolved over
                        the 9+ years since our last update.</p>

                    <p>We're not changing any policies at this time. We're just updating
                        the TACOS to reflect how we operate as clearly and accurately as possible.</p>

                    <p>The changes are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We replaced the first paragraph of the REGISTRATION section with the
                            equivalent text from the signup page, as it was the clearer of the two.
                            Now they don't just mean the same thing, they say the same thing, which
                            (we hope) reduces opportunities for "creative misinterpretation."
                        </li>
                        <li>We removed a section that said we <em>might</em> do something in the
                            case of an invalid transfer that we don't actually do and that doesn't
                            really make sense in the context. (In the event we detect such a transfer,
                            our actual practice is to reverse it.)
                        </li>
                        <li>We renamed CREDIT CARD BILLING PRACTICES to PAYMENT PRACTICES, changed
                            several occurrences of "credit card" to "payment method" and removed some
                            unnecessarily specific (and outdated) info about how transactions appear
                            on statements. (This isn't where people look for that information.)

                        <li>We changed references to "Personal Bandwidth Accounts" to "accounts"
                            because our service has evolved to the point where these days our members
                            typically pay for everything <em>but</em> bandwidth from their accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>We removed the requirement that PayPal payments have to be from the
                            email address on your membership to be refundable; we have not enforced that
                            requirement in years. (PayPal refunds, however, go back to the address
                            they came from.)
                        </li>
                        <li>Changed date format in the History of Changes to the ISO 8601 standard
                            YYYY-MM-DD. Death to MM/DD/YYYY! (And DD/MM/YYYY.)
                        </li>
                        <li>We removed some extra whitespace (invisible in HTML) from the text.</li>
                        <li>Small edits here and there for clarity and/or tonal consistency* that do
                            not change the meaning of anything.

                    <p>We made a few minor tweaks:</p>

                    <p>First, one bit of the REGISTRATION section blatantly contradicted the entire
                        rest of our service (including the preceding and following sentences in the
                        same section), stating that under certain circumstances we allowed
                        organizational <em>memberships</em> rather than organizational
                        <em>accounts</em>. (Documented proof that at least once in our history,
                        even we have
                        <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq#AcctMember">confused
                            the two</a>.)</p>

                    <p>We removed that because it was inaccurate and updated what was left to
                        make sure we are saying the same thing in the same way throughout our site
                        and service. Nothing about how we actually operate is affected by this
                        change, it's just shorter, more consistent, and less wrong now.</p>

                    <p>Note: We did at one point in the past allow "role memberships" to be
                        created, but only if a person neither had nor wanted an individual
                        membership and got prior approval from us. That proved to be a really
                        bad idea with a complex set of rules and restrictions nobody wanted to
                        follow, and was discontinued. Despite superficial similarity, this change
                        is not related to that, so if you're one of the few that still has a
                        pre-approved "role membership" this change does not affect you.</p>

                    <p>Second, we hacked up the REFUNDS section to be shorter and to better
                        reflect what happens when e.g. a credit card payment is too old to be
                        directly refunded.</p>

                    <p>Third, in the CREDIT CARD BILLING PRACTICES section, we removed a reference to "NFSN, LLC" which
                        has not appeared on credit card statements in many years.
                        We also changed our chargeback amount from "$25.00" to "up to $25.00"
                        to leave open the possibility for us to charge less. For reasons we do not
                        understand, sometimes we are charged less by processors, and we have zero
                        interest in chargebacks as a revenue source.</p>

                    <p>Fourth, the INDEMNITY section has been somewhat broadened. Unlike
                        the other changes, <strong>this does change the meaning.</strong>
                        The previous language limited our ability to recover
                        some types of legal costs that weren't related to lawsuits against us.
                        (E.g. fighting a subpoena in a lawsuit against you.) There have been
                        several cases where we have spent thousands of dollars fighting on behalf
                        of members who subsequently stiffed us or turned out to be lying to
                        us all along.</p>

                    <p>Our intent hasn't changed: to give ourselves as much flexibility as possible
                        to fight alongside our members when appropriate, without turning into a
                        legal aid clinic (which we cannot afford to be) or being left holding the bag
                        while someone with bad intentions makes a hasty getaway. However, this is
                        not a "to be clearer" or "reorganized" change.</p>

                    <p>All of our money comes from our members, so when someone else doesn't pay
                        the costs they incur, you do. That's not fair, so regrettably we need
                        stronger language in this area. As a result, if someone tells us they want us
                        to fight and lies about their willingness to cover the costs of doing so, it
                        will now be harder than it was yesterday for them to get away with it. The
                        other 99.99% of our members will not be affected.</p>

                        <li>The CONTENTS section was added.
                        <li>To pave the way for fully anonymous hosting, we added the
                            possibility of waiving our requirements related to providing your
                            personal information in the REGISTRATION section.
                        <li>Repetitious language in the CONDUCT section was consolidated without
                            changing its intent.
                        <li>Language has been added to the CONDUCT section
                            indicating that you may not use other services we provide (like ssh)
                            for purposes other than what we provide them for (maintaining your
                            site). This should have been obvious.
                        <li>In response to legal advice on the DMCA, a change was made to
                            the TERMINATION clause specifically clarifying that violating the
                            TOS may result in termination, and that termination for violating
                            the TOS may mean that you don't get a refund.
                        <li>The INTERNATIONAL USE section was expanded to clarify that
                            compliance with your local laws is your responsibility, and
                            that we may choose not to help thuggish foreign countries track down
                            the operators of critical/opposition websites.
                        <li>The VIOLATIONS section was removed, as it was primarily directed
                            at people who are not subject to the TOS.
                        <li>The THE END section was added to clarify that the history of changes
                            is not itself part of the TOS, leading to a mental recursion problem
                            when recording changes.
                    </ul>
                    <p>We also underlined the section headings. Woo-hoo, we're exciting people.</p>
