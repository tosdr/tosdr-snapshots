    &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).</p>

    <p>We take the privacy of your personal information seriously. We use similar
    services to store our personal information too, and we treat your personal
    information with the same care we demand for our own. This privacy policy
    represents a balance between maintaining your privacy and allowing us to
    continue to provide the Services to you.</p>

    <p>By using our Services, you accept this privacy policy, agree to the terms,

    reasonably available means, such as your name, address, telephone number, or

    <p>Personal Information does not include summarized, anonymized, or other
    non-personally identifiable information. Summarized information includes, for
    example, information that we collect about a group or category of products,

    removed.</p>

    <p>In the course of your use of our Services, services provided by third
    parties including, for example, Google Analytics, may store cookies or other
    information in your web browser in order to collect non-personally identifiable
    information about your use of our Services so that we may better understand how
    users use our Services. We do not have control over the actions of these third

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>Except as described in this privacy policy, we will never share your
    Personal Information with anyone else without your consent.</p>

    <p>We may share your Personal Information in the following situations:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Sharing Lists:</b> Our Services allow you to share your lists with
        other users of the Services, and send your lists by email, SMS, or other
        messaging system. Please be aware that any Personal Information you include
        in such lists will be made available to the recipients that you choose. You
        do so at your own risk. Even if you subsequently remove this information
        from our Services, the recipients may have stored or copied this
        information.</li>

        <li><b>Service Providers:</b> We contract with other companies and
        individuals to perform certain services on our behalf. To the extent these
        third parties have a legitimate need to access your Personal Information in
        order to complete their work, we will ensure they are contractually
        obligated to use this information only for the contracted work and for no
        other purpose.</li>

        <li><b>Business Transfers:</b> Information essential to our Services,
        including your Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise
        transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger,
        acquisition, sale of assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, or
        similar event in which your Personal Information is transferred to one or
        more third parties as part of our business assets.</li>

        <li><b>Investigations:</b> We may disclose your Personal Information if we
        believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect
        our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to,
        enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or
        otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other
        users of our Services.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In addition, we may provide non-personally identifiable information (i.e.
    <em>not</em> your Personal Information) relating to your location, items on
    your lists, your interactions with our Services, your mobile device and other
    identifiers, mobile device model, IP address, etc. to our third party
    advertising partners (for example, Google) in order to (i) retrieve and display
    targeted advertisements to you in connection with your use of our Services, and
    (ii) analyze the information for commercial purposes.</p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use various security measures to help protect your information from
    accidental loss, disclosure, and misuse. These measures include review of our
    system logs, off-site backups, data encryption, and security software. However,
    no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. We
    cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You
    transmit information and use our Services at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>Where Your Information Is Stored</h2>

    <p>Our servers are located, and your information is stored, in the United
    States of America. If you choose to use our Services from outside the U.S.A.,
    then please be aware that you are transferring your Personal Information
    outside of your country and into the U.S.A. for storage and processing. By
    providing your Personal Information to us through your use of our Services, you
    agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S.A. You should be
    aware that the privacy and data security laws of the U.S.A. may in some cases
    provide fewer protections than those of your own country.</p>

    <h2>General Data Protection Regulation</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a>
    (GDPR) is a European Union regulation intended to protect the data and
    privacy of individuals in the European Union. We process your “personal
    data” as defined by the GDPR (i.e., data that can be traced back to you as
    an individual), and we are therefore required to justify why we are
    lawfully permitted to process this data. Simply put, we collect and process
    the data that you give us (your email address, your shopping lists, your
    recipes) in order to provide you with a multi-user shopping list app. Doing
    so is the core purpose of our Services. We therefore have a “legitimate
    interest” (as defined by the GDPR) in processing this data (see
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article&nbsp;6</a>, paragraph&nbsp;1(f)). We
    do not process personal data that is incidental to the Services (such as your
    demographic data). Please feel free to
    <a href="mailto:privacy@ourgroceries.com">contact us</a> if you have questions about our
    GDPR compliance.</p>

    <h2>U.S. State Consumer Privacy Rights</h2>

    <p>Certain U.S. states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and
    Virginia, have adopted consumer privacy protection laws, such as the California
    Consumer Privacy Act, which are intended to protect the data and privacy of
    residents of that state. If you are a resident of these states then your specific
    rights under these laws include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Right to Request Deletion:</b> You have the right to request that we
        <a href="/faq#delete_account">delete your Personal Information</a>, subject to
        certain exceptions.</li>

        <li><b>Right to Request Correction:</b> You have the right to request that we
        correct inaccurate Personal Information about you.</li>

        <li><b>Right to Request Your Personal Information:</b> You have the right to
        request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal
        Information we collect, use, and disclose about you.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can delete your Personal Information by deleting your OurGroceries account
    <a href="/faq#delete_account">using the mobile or web applications</a>. To request
    that we describe or correct your Personal Information, please contact us by email
    at <a href="mailto:privacy@ourgroceries.com">privacy@ourgroceries.com</a> and we
    will be glad to help you out.</p>

    <p>OurGroceries does not sell or share your Personal Information, however certain
    information is shared with our advertising partners to provide personalized
    advertising, as described above in the “How We Share Your Information” section.
    The OurGroceries iOS and Android mobile applications each provide a setting for you
    to turn off personalized advertising in the app’s Settings screen under the Privacy
    section.</p>

    <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>If we make a material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you by
    email or within the OurGroceries apps so that you may review the new terms and
    decide whether to continue using the Services. We encourage you to periodically
    review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and
    share information.</p>
