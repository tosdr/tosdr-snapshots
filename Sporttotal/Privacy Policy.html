If a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can, among other things, analyze the key professional data (e.g. career level, company size, country, location, industry and job title) of our website visitors and thus better tailor our site to the respective target groups. We can also use LinkedIn Insight Tags to measure whether visitors to our websites make a purchase or take another action (conversion measurement). Conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g. from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also offers a retargeting function that we can use to display targeted advertising to visitors to our website outside the website, whereby, according to LinkedIn, no identification of the advertising addressee takes place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLinkedIn itself also collects log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser properties and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymized data is then deleted within 180 days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned to specific individuals by us as the website operator.
