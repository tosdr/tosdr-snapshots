    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Please note that these third-party services are beyond our direct control, and we
        cannot take responsibility for
        their actions or data-handling practices.</p>

    <h2>14. Confidentiality and Privilege</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">During the sign language interpretation sessions, the user may disclose personal or
        confidential information.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">All communication between the user and the interpreter during the session is
        confidential and shall not be
        disclosed to any third party without the user’s express consent, except as required by law.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">The information exchanged during the interpretation process is for the sole purpose of
        facilitating communication
        between the parties involved and shall not be used for any other purpose. Any disclosure, distribution, or use
        of the information exchanged, without the consent of the parties involved, is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>15. Payment and Financial Information Collection</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">The app collects payment information to facilitate payment for services provided. This
        may include credit card

    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">All payment information is collected and processed securely using industry-standard
        encryption and security
        protocols to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of such information.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Additionally, the app may collect and store billing information, including the user's
        name, address, and other
        relevant details to generate invoices or receipts for services provided. The app may also collect transaction
        history data to maintain records of past payments and transactions.</p>

    <h2>16. Recording and Retention of Session Data</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">The Company MAY record and retain sessions conducted on the App for a period of Six
        (6) months for quality
        assurance and record-keeping purposes, and to facilitate the resolution of any disputes that may arise.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">The recorded sessions may also be used to train and improve the accuracy of the App's
        interpretation services.
        However, the Company shall not use the recorded sessions for any other purposes and shall maintain the
        confidentiality and privacy of all users in accordance with Kenyan law.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">On the expiry of the 6-month retention period, we shall securely delete all recorded
        sessions unless otherwise
        required by Kenyan law or necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">The Company may also disclose recorded sessions if required to do so by law or by
        court order, or if the Company
        believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect its rights or property, respond to an
        emergency situation, or prevent a crime or save a life.</p>

    <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        liability for any issues or limitations in the app's functionality if you do not have access to proper Wi-Fi
        connectivity or data bundles. It is the user's responsibility to ensure a reliable internet connection for
        optimal app performance.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">We shall not be liable to users for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        or punitive damages arising
        out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the app, even if we have been advised of the
        possibility of such damages.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Our total liability to users shall not exceed the total amount paid by users, if any,
        to access the app.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">If you are using the app outside an area with Wi-Fi, it's essential to be mindful that
        your mobile network
        provider's terms of agreement will still be applicable. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile
        provider for data usage during your app access or other third-party charges.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">By using the app, you acknowledge responsibility for any such charges, including
        roaming data charges if you use
        the app outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Furthermore, if you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
        app, please note that we
        assume you have obtained consent from the bill payer to use the app. It is your responsibility to ensure that
        you have the appropriate permissions and that you are aware of any potential charges that may arise while using
        the app on your mobile network.</p>

    <h2>19. Indemnification</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">By using this App, you agree to indemnify us and our affiliates and to hold us
        harmless against any and all
        claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and court costs) arising from
        your use or misuse of our services. This includes but is not limited to any violation of these Terms and
        Conditions, any infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity, or any breach
        of any representation or warranty made by you herein.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">In the event of any such claim or demand, we reserve the right to select our own legal
        counsel to represent us,
        and you agree to cooperate fully with such counsel.</p>

    <h2>20. Limitation on Liability</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">By using this app, you acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any
        direct, indirect, incidental,
        special, or consequential damages that may result from your misuse of the app, including but not limited to
        damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses.</p>

    <h2>21. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and <a
            href="https://razorinformatics.co.ke" target="_blank">Razor informatics</a> and supersede any
        prior agreements, communications, or understandings, whether written or oral, regarding the use of the app.</p>

    <h2>22. SEVERABILITY</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable
        for any reason, the
        remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court finds that any provision of these
        Terms and Conditions is invalid or unenforceable but that by limiting such provision, it would become valid and
        enforceable, then such provision will be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.</p>

    <h2>23. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        Laws of Kenya. Any disputes
        arising out of or in connection with these terms and conditions or the use of the app shall be submitted to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">By using the app, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya and
        waive any objections to the
        exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts.</p>

    <h2>24. Disputes</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Any dispute relating in any way to your use of this app or to products you purchase
        from us shall be arbitrated
        by the Kenyan court system, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.</p>

    <h2>25. Modification of Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">We may modify or update these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice.
        It is the user's
        responsibility to regularly check for updates to these terms. By continuing to use the app after any changes to
        these terms have been made, the user agrees to the updated terms.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">Any notices regarding changes to these terms will be provided through electronic mail
        or other means deemed
        appropriate.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1rem;">These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the user and <a
