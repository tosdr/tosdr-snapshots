<h4>Information you provide to us</h4>

your <a href="https://5apps.com/account/settings">account settings page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Billing information</strong> is required only when subscribing to a paid
plan, or making a one-time payment for a service. We may collect
credit/debit card details, or information related to other payment
methods, in order to facilitate payments. Optionally, you can provide
invoicing information, such as company name and address, and VAT ID,

used for our bookkeeping and accounting.</p></li>

a problem with our services, request support from us, or otherwise
correspond with us, will be used to provide such support and investigate
the problem at hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publicly accessible data</strong>, i.e. public profile information from
connected sites, such as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, will be used to
improve your experience by for example pre-filling your username, or
automatically importing your public SSH keys.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Information we collect automatically</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Browser information</strong>, such as browser type, IP address, language,

headers</a>. If you signal your
preference to not have this data collected, it will never enter our
database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note: we do not use any external analytics services for
