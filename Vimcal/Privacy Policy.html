Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>11. International Data Transfers</h4><p class="privacy">Vimcal, the Site, and its services may be accessed globally (despite the geographic restrictions we implement) and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world.Because different countries may have different data protection laws than theUnited States (or your own country, if you are using Vimcal outside of theUnited States), we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this privacy policy.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>12. Your Rights And Options</h4><p>You have the right to:</p><p>▪  <strong>Opt-out </strong>of marketing emails and other direct marketing.</p><p>▪  <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a“data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p>▪  <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you.This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p>▪  <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p>▪  <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p>▪  <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p><p>o  If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</p><p>o  Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p><p>o  Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p><p>o  You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p>▪  <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p class="paragraph-28">▪  <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  You can withdraw your consent, for example ,by turning off GPS location sharing in your Device settings.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>13. Data Retention</h4><p class="paragraph-27">We retain your data for as long as your Account is active or you are otherwise accessing and using Vimcal or as needed to provide you Vimcal.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4><p class="paragraph-40">We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat your personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page, and we may also send a courtesy email to you to the email address we have on file for you, if any.</p><p>The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>15.
