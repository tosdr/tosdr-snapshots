Any dispute or claim arising in any way from your use ofVimcal, except for disputes relating to the infringement of our intellectual property rights or the access or use of Vimcal in violation of these Terms, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, but you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. </p><p><em>No Judge or Jury. </em>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would. </p><p><em>Arbitrator and Rules.</em> The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final andbinding, and the arbitral proceedings shall be governed by the AAA CommercialArbitration Rules. If you are a consumer visitor that is not a User, the AAAConsumer Arbitration Rules shall apply instead. These rules can be found on the AAA website at www.adr.org.</p><p><em>Starting an Arbitration</em>. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send us a notice of dispute, in writing, setting forth your name, address and contact information, the facts of the dispute and relief requested. You must send your notice of legal dispute to us at the following address: legal@vimcal.com. Company will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.</p><p><em>Format ofProceedings</em>.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Company each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you acknowledge and agree that any controversy that may arise under these Terms is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, you and we irrevocably and unconditionally waive any right you or we may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to these Terms.  As a result, PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p><p><em>Enforcement</em>. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator maybe entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United NationsConventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability.</p><p><em>Invalidity</em>. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, or otherwise in the case of a dispute not subject to arbitration, you and Company each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in New York City, State of New York, and you and Company each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable dispute or claim.</p><p><em>Opting Out.</em> If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Company and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@vimcal.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use Vimcal.</p><p><em>Costs andAttorneys’ Fees</em>.
