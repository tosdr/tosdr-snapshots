        that you provide us when you use our website and/or our software/services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. When we collect data
        during your visit either to this website and/or through the use of our
        software/services by which you can be identified, then you can be assured that it
        will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement and the appropriate
        data protection laws. Any data collected will not be publicly disclosed by us nor
        transferred to any third parties without your prior consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>fruux</em> may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You
        should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any
        changes. This policy is effective from January 1, 2008.
    </p>

    <h2>Recording and processing of data</h2>
    <p>
        When you visit this website and/or use our software/services, our servers make a
        temporary record of each access and stores it in a log file. The following data is
        recorded and stored until it is automatically deleted:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-text">
        <li>IP address of the requesting device</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Name and URL of the file downloaded</li>
        <li>Amount of data transmitted</li>
        <li>An indication whether the download was successful</li>
        <li>Data identifying the browser and operating system</li>
        <li>The website from which our site was accessed</li>
        <li>Name of your ISP (internet service provider)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally we use Google Analytics in order to track the usage of our website.</p>
    <p>The purpose of recording this data is to:</p>
    <ul class="list-text">
        <li>allow use of the website (connection setup)</li>
        <li>maintain overall system security</li>
        <li>allow technical administration of our network infrastructure</li>
        <li>optimise our internet services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not compile personal profiles of any of our users. The German Telemedia Act
        (TMG - <em>Telemediengesetz</em>) states that user profiles are permissible under
        the condition that pseudonyms are used and on condition that the user does not
        withhold consent. If we do intend to use this condition anywhere on our website, a
        notice informing you of your right to withdraw consent will be posted on the
        respective page(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the exceptions stated above, we do not process any personal data without
        first obtaining your expressed consent to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Use and transfer of personal data</h2>
    <p>
        Any usage of your personal data is confined to the purposes as stated above and will
        only be undertaken to the extent necessary for these purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities
        with the exception of compliance with mandatory national legislation or if the
        transfer of such data is necessary in order to take any legal action in case of
        fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not be transferred
        to third parties for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>

        necessary to provide you with certain features when you use them (for example, when
        you choose to create a public calendar). This permission also extends to trusted
        third parties that <em>fruux</em> works with in order to provide you with the
        software/services, for example Amazon Web software/servicess (AWS), which provides
        our technical infrastructure. This permission also includes our design and programming
        standards that administer our software/services (for example how backup your data to
        avoid data loss).
