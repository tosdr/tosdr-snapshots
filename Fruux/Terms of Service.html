    <h2>Free Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        <em>fruux</em> allows you to use its software/services free of charge with a
        limited set of features. We reserve the right to terminate free accounts at any
        time. If a free account remains inactive for ninety (90) days or has no current
        email address assigned to it then we reserve the right to terminate your account
        and delete any data stored on our servers without prior notice.
    </p>
    <h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        <em>fruux</em> offers paid accounts with additional features upon payment of
        a fee. Once an account has been converted to a paid account, it is no longer
        subject to the restrictions placed upon free accounts. <em>fruux</em> accepts
        credit cards and will automatically bill your card according to your selected
        plan (monthly/yearly and/or based on your usage). If the fees due are not paid
        within the allocated time period or if we cannot process your credit card with
        the information you provided then <em>fruux</em> reserves the right to cancel
        both access to your account and the data stored within that account. If you do
        not pay any fees due within ten (10) days of us sending you a written due notice,
        then we reserve the right to downgrade your account to a free account.
    </p>
    <h2>Billing</h2>
    <p>
        Any fees for paid accounts will be charged on the day you upgrade your account.
        If the paid account comes with a free trial period then nothing will be charged to
        you until this period is over (if you cancel your account within the trial period
        then no charges are due either). Your account will renew after the initial charge
        either monthly or yearly (depending on which interval you have chosen), so long as
        you do not cancel it before the renewal payment is due. In using our software/service,
        you agree that the amount billed for renewal payments may differ owing to (and is
        not limited to) reasons such as promotional offers, account changes (such as
        different features) and changes in any taxes due. You also agree that we may
        charge your credit card on file with us for such varying amounts as well. We may
        also periodically authorise your credit card in anticipation of any fees due. All
        fees and charges relating to our software/services are non-refundable and we do not
        provide refunds or credits for part-used periods.
    </p>
    <h2>Cancelling your account</h2>
    <p>
        Paid accounts will automatically renew unless cancelled by you or terminated by
        us. In order to to avoid being billed for the preceding period, you must cancel your
        paid account <strong>before</strong> its renewal date (whether monthly or yearly,
        depending on your plan). <em>fruux</em> accounts are prepaid and non-refundable. No
        refunds or credits for any part-used periods (whether monthly or yearly) will be
        provided. <em>fruux</em> accounts may be cancelled at any time and will remain
        effective until the period that has been paid for (and up till) ends.
    </p>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        By using our website and/or software/services, you agree to our
        <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.

    <p>

        affiliates, officers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including
        reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your
        use of the Software/Service or the infringement by you of any intellectual property
        or other right of any person or entity.
    </p>
    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>

        will always be available on our website. We will notify you (for example via email)
        if we make (at our discretion) material changes. Other changes will be posted to our
        Terms page, so please check it regularly. By using our software/services after a new

    </p>
    <h2>Jurisdiction and applicable law</h2>
    <p>
        In the event of dispute, the place of performance and legal venue is (unless otherwise
        required by law) our registered office in Münster, Germany. The law of the Federal
        Republic of Germany shall be applicable.
    </p>
    <h2>Severability Clause</h2>
    <p>
        If provisions in our terms are totally or partially not legally effective or for
        any reason lose their legal effectiveness, the validity of the remainder is not
        effected in any way. If you've been reading all the way up to here, then please send
        us an <a href="http://support.fruux.com">email</a> – we
        might even have a little surprise in store for you (limited supply, subject to availability).
