						been copied to external sites. Please be careful when disclosing personal information in
						these public areas.
					</p>

					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
						Springshare takes the security of your information and the security of Springshare Services
						very seriously. We take commercially reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access
						to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, data that you share and that we
						collect and store. These security measures may include practices such as keeping your data on
						a secured server behind a firewall, internal reviews of our data collection practices and
						platforms, and industry-standard encryption technologies. However, no website or service is
						completely secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have reason to believe that a third-party has gained unauthorized access to your information,
						please contact us immediately at privacy@springshare.com. If Springshare becomes aware of any
						data breach, we will notify affected individuals or, with respect to Springshare Services,
						affected institutions as soon as reasonably possible.
					</p>

					<h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
					<h4>Communication Preferences and Opt-outs</h4>
					<p>
						If you have subscribed to one or more of our email newsletters or are receiving marketing emails
						from us and you don’t want them anymore, you can unsubscribe. Follow the instructions contained
						in the email message to opt-out of receiving future messages of that type.  However, you cannot
						unsubscribe from some service related messages ("operational emails") so long as you maintain
						an account with Springshare Services.
					</p>

					<h4>Access, Correction, and Erasure, Right to limit use, and to limit disclosure</h4>
					<p>
						You may request to review, correct or delete the personal information that you have previously
						provided to us through the Springshare Services. For requests to access, correct or delete your
						personal information, please send your request along with any details you may have regarding the
						method by which the information was submitted to privacy@springshare.com. Requests to access,
						change, or delete your information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe.
					</p>
					<p>
						To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity,
						such as requiring a username or userID, or password, or other types of verification before
						granting access to or removing your information. In cases where we are acting as a processor
						of personal data for our Customer, we may first refer your request to the Customer that submitted
						your personal data. We will assist our Customer as needed in responding to your request,
						as further described below under <i>Springshare Services-Customer Data</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In accordance with the Data Privacy Framework, EEA, UK and Swiss residents whose personal information is collected may have a right to access personal information regarding them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal information or to object to their personal data being used for any purpose materially different from the purposes disclosed to them or stated within this Privacy Policy. Springshare will provide the said data to EEA, UK and Swiss residents upon request and will comply with any requests to limit use of their personal information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please contact privacy@springshare.com for more information about exercising these rights.
					</p>

					<h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
					<p>
						If you request to delete your personal information, we will endeavor to fulfill your request but
						some personal information may persist in backup copies for a certain period of time and may be
						retained as necessary for legitimate business purposes or to comply with our legal obligations.
						Springshare's policy is to keep backups of Springshare Services data for 35 days, after which
						the original customer data older than 35 days is permanently deleted from Springshare servers.
						Springshare may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose
						of collection, and for a reasonable time thereafter in accordance with applicable law. We also
						may retain your information during the period of time needed for Springshare to conduct audits,
						comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
					</p>

					<h4>Cross-border transfers of personal information</h4>
					<p>
						Springshare Services are hosted in data centers located in several regions around the world.
						Every region operates independently of one another, and we use all reasonable efforts to host
						the Springshare Services and Customer Data in their respective home regions. Springshare Services
						are currently hosted in four (4) regions - United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union.
						If, during the course of conducting normal business of providing Springshare Services, we transfer
						your information to a recipient in a country outside your respective home region, we will ensure
						that at least one of the following applies:  (i) the transfer will be to countries deemed to
						provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by your respective governing body
						(such as European Commission); (ii) we have used specific model contracts (for example, those
						approved by the European Commission) intended to give personal data the same protection it has
						in its home region; (iii) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to
						them if they are part of the Data Privacy Framework which requires them to provide similar protection to
						personal data shared between the Europe and the US; or (iv) any alternative transfer mechanism
						that lawfully supports the transfer under the GDPR or similar law in your home region.
					</p>

					<h3>Children</h3>
					<p>
						The Springshare Services and websites are intended for use by users aged 13 and older. We do not
						market to nor intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from children under
						thirteen (13) years of age. If you are under 13, please do not register for any of our Services
						or websites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, email
						address or phone number). If we become aware that a visitor under the age of 13 has submitted
						personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her information
						from our Services. Please contact privacy@springshare.com if you are aware of any personal
						information supplied to one of Springshare Services or websites by a child under the age of
						thirteen (13).
					</p>
	
					<h3>Links to Other Services and Websites</h3>
					<p>
						Springshare Services and websites may contain links to information created and/or maintained on
						third-party websites. When users select a link to an outside website, they are leaving Springshare
						Services and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners of the third-party
						website. We are not responsible for, and we do not endorse or control, the policies or practices
						of any such website or services. In some cases, Springshare Services may contain an embedded
						content feed, video player, widget, or other application from a third party and those feeds,
						players, widgets, or other applications may appear to be part of the Springshare Service or
						website, even though they are provided or served by a third-party. If information is required
						for the performance of the service, the service provider is required to protect your information
						consistent with this privacy policy. For further information, please see the <i>How We Share
						Information About You</i> section of this policy. We encourage our users to be aware when they
						leave Springshare Service or website or use a third-party service embedded inside Springshare
						Service, and to read the privacy policies of these third party services.
					</p>

						submitted may contain personal information described in this Privacy Policy.

						with such Customers, or as may be required by law. In accordance with such agreements, Springshare

						Services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems or other purposes as set forth
						in such agreements or required by law.

						Springshare acknowledges that you have the right to access, correct, amend and delete your
						personal information. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been
						submitted to us by a Springshare Customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to
						access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the Springshare Customer directly.
						Because Springshare is subject to our agreements with Customers (as the data controller) with
						respect to your personal information stored on the Springshare Services, if you wish to make your

						data to the Springshare Services. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support
						the Customer as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable time frame.
