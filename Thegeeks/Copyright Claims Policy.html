It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to TheGeeks.click as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.<br><br>

<b>IMPORTANT: Misrepresentations made in your notice regarding whether material or activity is infringing may expose you to liability for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees). Courts have found that you must consider copyright defenses, limitations or exceptions before sending a notice.</b><br><br>

To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format (including section numbers):<br><br>

1. Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon (for example, "The copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on http://www.legal.com/legal_page.html") or other information sufficient to specify the copyrighted work being infringed.<br><br>

2. Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above.<br><br>

3. Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit contact with your Name, Mailing Address, Email Address, and Phone Number.<br><br>

4. Provide reasonable evidence that you are the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner.<br><br>

5. Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."<br><br>

6. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."<br><br>

7. Sign and submit the document <b><A HREF='mailto:dmca@thegeeks.click'>here</a></b>. Your digital signature is as legally binding as a physical signature. Please note that your signature must exactly match the First and Last names that you specified earlier.
