<h2>Mission statement - <font color=#1d3953>What is TheGeeks All About?</font></h2>
<table width=100% border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
TheGeeks was born as an expansion to  <a class=altlink href=https://theplace.click/main.php><b>ThePlace.click</b></a> (Seduction and Self Help), <a class=altlink href=https://thevault.click/main.php><b>TheVault.click</b></a> (Business and Wealth), and <a class=altlink href=https://theoccult.click/main.php><b>TheOccult.click</b></a> (Esoteric Studies). TheGeeks aims to be the one stop knowledge shop for educating the masses.<BR>
<BR>
TG is an eLearning tracker, created to include topics and disciplines which are not directly covered by our sister sites. Subject areas include a broad range of academic disciplines, general and technical knowledge. Our main focus is to build and provide a community for people interested in enriching their minds. A place where knowledge seekers can interact, educate and constantly improve themselves, regardless of their station in life.
<br><br>
As such, members of TheGeeks are encouraged to be helpful and courteous to other members. Disruptive or antisocial behaviour is clearly 
counterproductive (except as to provide an example of how NOT to act) and will be quickly dealt with.

<h2>Downloading rules - <font color=#1D3953>By not following these rules you will lose download privileges!</font></h2>
<table width=100% border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<div style="padding:10px;margin-left:5px;">

<ul>
<li>Access to exclusives is conditional upon user class.</li>
<li>A fair ratio to keep is 1.0 - meaning that you have uploaded as much as you have downloaded.  Low ratios will result 
in severe consequences, including banning in extreme cases. </li><br>
The minimum ratio requirements can be found <a class=altlink
href=ratio.php><b>here</b></a>.<br><br>

<!--The minimum ratio requirements are: <br><br>
<ul>
0.0 with < 2 GB downloaded<br>
0.4 with 2 GB downloaded<br>
0.5 with 3 GB downloaded<br>
0.6 with 5 GB downloaded<br>
0.8 with 12+ GB downloaded.<br>
</ul>
<br>
Accounts with ratios below these minimum levels will NOT be allowed to download additional torrents (including FREE ones) until their ratio has exceeded these levels.<br><br>
Automatic class demotion to <b>Peasant</b>:
</ul>
<br>
If you've been a member for over 7 days and your ratio drops below 0.4 (with 2GB+ downloaded), you will automatically receive a warning, you will only be able to leech 5 torrents at a time (NOTE: users in the second case can't leech at all), and you will lose any invites you have. In another 14 days, if your ratio has not risen above 0.4, you will automatically be demoted to peasant and will only be able to leech 1 torrent at a time. When this happens, you will have 2 weeks (14 days) to correct it or your account will be disabled. If you correct your ratio, the warning will automatically be removed and you will be promoted back to the User class, with all the benefits of that class again.<br><br>
-->
<li>Users are able to leech 10 torrents at a time.</li>
<li>Power Users are able to leech 50 torrents at a time.</li>
<li>Extreme Users are able to leech 100 torrents at a time.</li>
<li>VIPs are able to leech 100 torrents at a time (ask us if you want this raised).</li>
<li>Elites are able to leech 100 torrents at a time (ask us if you want this raised).</li>
<li>You must have legal rights to the file you are downloading.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>No aggressive behaviour or flaming in the forums.</li>

<h2>Avatar Guidelines - <font color=#1D3953>Please try to follow these guidelines</font></h2>
<table width=100% border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<div style="padding:10px;margin-left:5px;">

<ul>
<li>The allowed formats are .gif, .jpg and .png.</li>
<li>Be considerate. Resize your images to a width of 150 px and a size of no more than 150 KB.
(Browsers will rescale them anyway: smaller images will be expanded and will not look good;
larger images will just waste bandwidth and CPU cycles.) For now this is just a guideline but
it will be automatically enforced in the near future.</li>
<li>Do not use potentially offensive material involving porn, religious material, animal / human
cruelty or ideologically charged images. Mods have wide discretion on what is acceptable.
If in doubt PM one.</li>

<h2>Uploading rules - <font color=#004E98>Torrents violating these rules may be deleted without notice</font></h2>
<table width=100% border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<div style="padding:10px;margin-left:5px;">

<ul>
<li><b><font color=red>LEARNING MATERIAL ONLY!</b></font> If there's any doubt about what you want to share, <a class=altlink href=contactstaff.php><b>Contact Staff</b></a> before uploading and wait for a response.</li>
<li><b>Do NOT upload duplicates!</b> Use the Torrent Search Function to make sure you're not uploading a duplicate ( include dead torrents in your searches please ). Also, use an adequate amount of Torrent name and spelling variations, if necessary, when searching. Make a good faith effort to NOT upload a duplicate please.</li>
<li>No MPAA/RIAA materials allowed. You will receive 1 warning. Subsequent violations will result in banning.</li>
<li>No hotlinking of images. Copy an image to a image hosting service (like imgur.com) and use that instead.</li>
<li><b><font color = red>Use the Torrent naming conventions listed as Examples on the Upload Page.</b></font></li>
<li>FYI - Search Engines don't interpret <b>Robert Kiyosaki-Choose To Be Rich</b> as we might.  Without a space, Search Engines see "Kiyosaki-Choose" as one word. In this example a space is needed on BOTH sides of the hyphen (-). To better facilitate Member searchs avoid running words together and keep seperators ( -, _, +, /,  etc... ) one space away from words. "SearchEngineNews" is not equivalent to "Search Engine News" when it comes to searches.  Notice the use of spaces in the Examples provided on the Upload Page.</li>
<li><b>A good description is required as well</b>. Use <a class=altlink href=redir.php?url=http://www.google.com><b>Google</b></a> to get additional information from the Authors name to material that can be used in the description. A link to the Sales Page is sometimes helpful if it's available BUT nothing beats a good description in the long run.  If you don't you will receive a warning.  After three warnings, you will be banned.</li>
<li>If you are sharing Exclusive material meant only for TheGeeks, <a class=altlink href=contactstaff.php><b>Contact Staff</b></a> and ask them to 'enable exclusive upload ability on your account'. Once this option is set, a new section will appear at the bottom of the upload page. It is at this location that you set the class delays.  To set up contributers, upload the torrent with the appropriate delays.  Click on the 'Edit Torrent' link on the details page for the torrent you just uploaded.  The contributer list is at the bottom.<br><br>
Here's some HTML code you can Paste in the Top of your Description and be sure to SET Exclusive SETTINGS located on the bottom of the Torrent Creation Page.
<br><br>
<b><font color =red>TheGeeks.click Exclusive... sharing elsewhere will result in being banned!</b></font>
<br><br>
The code looks like this:<br><br>
[size=2][color=red][b]TheGeeks.click Exclusive... sharing elsewhere will result in being banned![/b][/color][/size]
<br><br>
<b>... and last but not least please make any links included in the description clickable.</b><li>
<li>Banned file formats: .ratdvd, .rar, .zip (Please don't upload any materials in these formats or you will be warned.)
<li>Do NOT upload any products in an archived format (.zip, .rar, .ace, etc).  This prevents people from only grabbing a portion of the files contained in the .torrent.  You will be warned when you do this and your torrents will be deleted. Do it multiple times and your account will be in jeopardy.</li>
<li>Make sure your torrents are well-seeded for at least 24 hours.</li>
<li>You must have legal rights to the file you are uploading.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
If you have something interesting that somehow violates these rules,  <a class=altlink href=contactstaff.php><b>Contact Staff</b></a> and we might make an exception.
