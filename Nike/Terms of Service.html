<p>Welcome to the NIKE community!  You are reading these Terms because you are using a NIKE website, digital experience, social media platform, mobile app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or services, all of which are part of NIKE’s Platform (“Platform”).  You may access the Platform through a computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”.  Your carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</p>
<p><strong>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE and its affiliates (which we may refer to as “NIKE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform</strong>. Please review our <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://agreementservice.svs.nike.com/rest/agreement/localentities/en/US/com.nike.commerce.nikedotcom.web/redirect/true">List of Local Entities</a> for the name of the NIKE entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact information. A few important points:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Our Terms May Change.  Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer terms, so this paragraph may not apply to you.  [See <a href="#Canada">Canada</a> terms.] </strong>We may update these Terms from time to time.  If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification.  Read through any changes, and if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform.  If you continue to use our Platform after we notify you of changes, you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.  </li>
