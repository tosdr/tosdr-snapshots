In the event of disagreements over whether a compliant Notice of Dispute was sent or an arbitration was filed without completing this informal resolution process, the party aggrieved by this failure can seek relief from a court with appropriate jurisdiction to enjoin the arbitration from proceeding until this informal resolution has been completed, and to order the party that has not followed the informal resolution process to reimburse the other party for any arbitration fees and costs already incurred. If Psyonix does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of a compliant notice of the Dispute, you or Psyonix with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><span class="s7" style=" background-color: #F8F8F8;">Coordinated </span><span class="s8" style=" background-color: #F8F8F8;">Filings. </span><span class="s6">If 25 or more notices of Disputes are sent that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “</span><span class="p">Coordinated Cases</span><span class="s6">” and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Cases are sought to be filed in arbitration as set forth in this Agreement.

If counsel for the parties do not agree on the number of bellwethers, an even number shall be chosen by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter (or, in the arbitration provider’s discretion, by a process arbitrator). Factors that the arbitration provider may consider in deciding how many bellwether trials to order include the complexity of the dispute and differences in facts or applicable laws among various cases. Once the number of bellwethers is fixed, by agreement or by the arbitration provider, each side shall select half that number from among the claimants who have provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and <b>only </b>those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. No other cases may be filed until those bellwether matters have concluded, and Psyonix may not be required to pay any fees associated with arbitration demands other than those permitted to be filed as bellwethers.

Psyonix and counsel for the claimants must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether trial. If counsel for Psyonix and claimants cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. Psyonix and counsel for the claimants will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">If the mediation does not yield a global resolution, this arbitration requirement shall no longer apply to Disputes that are the subject of Coordinated Cases for which a compliant Notice of Dispute was received by the other party but that were not resolved in bellwether proceedings. To the extent you are asserting the same claims as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. If a formerly arbitrable Dispute is brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in the Coordinated Cases who provided compliant Notices of Dispute. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis. A court with appropriate jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this bellwether process and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.
