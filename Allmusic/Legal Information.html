        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>

        <p>
            Netaktion LLC (“<strong>Netaktion</strong>”) respects your right to privacy.  This Privacy Notice explains who we are,
            how we collect, share and use personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.
            This Notice applies to personal information that we collect through our website at
            <a href="https://www.allmusic.com" title="AllMusic">https://www.allmusic.com</a>,
            (“<strong>Website</strong>”) and which we collect when you use or interact with our products and services.  If you have any
            questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact
            details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>1. What Does Netaktion Do?</h2>

            <p>
                Netaktion provides advertising technology products and services. We are headquartered in the U.S.  For
                more information regarding our business, please visit the website link set out above.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>2. What is Targeted Advertising?</h2>

            <p>
                Certain of our products and services involve the provision of targeted advertising. This involves providing
                tailored advertising to online users based on their interests and behaviors. Crucially, our
                targeted advertising is conducted at an "audience" or a "segment" level (e.g., males in Chicago
                aged 25-34 who like cars) and so does not directly identify individuals.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not intentionally collect information that identifies you (such as your name, address,
                phone number, or email address) as part of our targeted advertising activities, and we prohibit
                our partners from sharing this information with us. We act on behalf of our customers in
                providing any targeted advertising products and services.

            </p>

            <h2>3. What Personal Information Does Netaktion Collect and Why?</h2>

            <p>
                The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
                <li style="list-style: disc;"><em><u>Information that you provide voluntarily</u></em><br><br>
                    Certain parts of our Website or services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily.
                    For example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us,
                    to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit inquiries to us. The personal
                    information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made
                    clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.<br>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
                <li style="list-style: disc;"><em><u>Information that we collect automatically</u></em><br><br>

                    <strong>Our Website</strong><br><br>

                    When you visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device.
                    In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be
                    considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.<br><br>

                    Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address,
                    device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g.,
                    country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about
                    how your device has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.<br><br>

                    Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website,
                    where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them. We use this information
                    for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.<br><br>

                    <strong>Our Products and Services</strong><br><br>

                    We may collect browser-based information regarding how you interact with advertising placed via our
                    products and services. This information may include the following: (i) technographic data related to
                    the browser, operating system, and device, such as the name and version of your browser, (ii) connection
                    data (such as the device’s current IP address), (iii) the current website visited, (iv) the website visited
                    before the current website, (v) the title of the game for any in-game advertising, (vi) search terms,
                    (vii) the date and time of the website visit, (viii) whether you have clicked on the advertising of
                    our customer/our customer's website, visited the advertiser’s website, or undertaken a transaction
                    with the advertiser, (ix) information like the aforementioned regarding the activity of users who
                    share full length or shortened links via social media channels.<br><br>

                    We may also collect from our customers/partners certain non-identifying demographic information
                    about users such as their gender, approximate regional location (e.g., country and town),
                    and age, or generic categories about users and their interests (e.g., "female sports fan").<br><br>

                    We may collect general health related information in association with customized advertising
                    campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment
                    or condition can include, but is not limited to the following examples: acne, allergies, dental,
                    vision, heartburn, cold and flu, sinus, headache, back pain, first aid, sore throat and
                    cholesterol management. In addition, interest in subjects such as diet, nutrition, exercise,
                    beauty, hair removal, health and fitness may also be collected. Note that such information
                    is only collected/processed at an aggregate level and solely in the U.S. and Canada. This
                    information is not collected in relation to individuals located in the European Economic Area.<br><br>

                    Certain customers may choose to implement our Po.st technology, which facilitates the
                    sharing of web content. When users use the Po.st services, we may receive information
                    about which channel was used for sharing or receiving content (e.g. a social network or
                    email). In addition, if a user uses Po.st to send an URL link to another user, and the
                    user clicks on the sent URL link, we may also receive the above browser-based information
                    related to this user.<br><br>

                    If you are using our products/services via a mobile application, we may use the Apple IFA,
                    Android Advertiser ID, or other device information that uniquely identifies a mobile device
                    in order to match certain information that we collect via the mobile application.<br><br>

                    In certain territories, advertisers may also elect to run Netaktion Surveys after their
                    advertisements. "Netaktion Surveys" are short surveys that users can voluntarily elect to
                    participate in and where such survey responses may be used to create lookalike models that
                    are not tied to a specific user. Such survey questions are a way for advertisers to obtain
                    information directly from users about their interests. Users might be asked, for instance,
                    "Which of the following comedy programs do you watch?" with a drop-down menu of TV shows,
                    or "How frequently do you travel for business?" with a drop down menu of different options.
                    We may place cookies, or collect mobile device identifiers, associated with this survey
                    information or inferences or data segments we create from it. We may use the information
                    we collect from Netaktion Surveys in all of the ways we use the other information
                    described in this Privacy Notice.<br><br>

                    We use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track
                    your session usage, Google drops a cookie (_ga) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser.
                    This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc.
                    We also send Google your IP Address. We use GA to track aggregated website behavior, such as
                    what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is important to us for
                    improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness. If you choose to opt out of
                    this anonymized process please visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" title="Opt out of Google Analytics">

            <p>
                We and/or our customers may use technology that establishes connections among related devices (such as
                mobile devices and desktop computers) both to deliver advertising that may be more relevant to you, as

                applications on one of your devices may be combined with information from your other devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and in
                doing so, we may share anonymous identifiers with those third parties in order to make connections among
                related devices. We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among related devices
                within the same household. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions
                set out in the Opting-out of Cookies Usage div below.

            <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Visitors Only)</h2>

            <p>
                If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and
                using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information
                concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal
                information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate
                interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
                In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you
                or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a
                contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the
                provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
                consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
            </p>

            <p>
                If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those
                of any third party), this interest will normally be to provide our services and communicating with
                customers / users as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial
                interest, for instance, when responding to queries, improving our services, undertaking marketing,
                or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate
                interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those
                legitimate interests are.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we
                collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided

            <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>

            <p>
                Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the
                country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are
                different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
            </p>

            <p>
                Specifically, our servers are located in the US and the Netherlands, and our group companies
                and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that
                when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

            <p>
                However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will
                remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European
                Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group
                companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the
                EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses

            <p>
                We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business
                need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
                legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process
                your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for
                example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
                deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use personal information used for targeted advertising purposes for no more than 13 months.
                We maintain ad server log data and stored data for a period of up to 18 months in order to comply
                with audits, court order or law enforcement inquiries. After 18 months, all of the stored data
                is destroyed. Summarized data is kept indefinitely. Summarized data is aggregated statistical
                data (impressions, clicks, and conversions) used for financial reporting purposes.
