			<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:15px">
	AOPS INCORPORATED PRIVACY POLICY - EFFECTIVE February 26, 2024
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">
	This Privacy Policy applies to all users. Please <a href="#coppa">click here</a> for our specific information practices with
	regards to children under 13 (also provided at the end of this policy).
</p>

<p>
	We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only
	collect the information necessary to provide our services efficiently.
</p>

<h1> 
	What information does Art of Problem Solving collect and how is that information used?
</h1>

<h2>
	Users using our online community or other online resources
	requiring membership
</h2>

<p>
	To post information in a forum, to use some of our online educational
	tools, or to attend online classes, you must become a member of the Art
	of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal
	information we require is your email address and a username that you select.
	The username that you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you;
	it is strongly recommended that it not be your real name, but a pseudonym.
	You will also select a password, which is needed to log on. We do ask about
	your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none
	of this information is required for membership in the Community.
</p>
<p>
	Your email address is used by us to send messages to you. We do so to
	confirm your username and password if you should forget your username
	or password. We also use your email address to assist in administering
	our web site and to help enforce our conduct rules (for example,
	people who post offensive messages in the forum can be banned). Should
	you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email
	address will be used for communication purposes for that class. We
	will not send solicitation emails collected as part of the Art of
	Problem Solving Community unless the user elects to join our mailing
	lists. If you elect to join our mailing lists, we may share your name, 
	phone number, and email address with third parties to share updates and 
	information about our services/related services with you. 
	We will not share your email address with any other third parties except
	when required by law.
</p>
<p>
	Our site has forums (message boards), private messaging, and real-time
	discussion available to its members. Please remember that any
	information that is disclosed in these areas is potentially available
	to other members and in some cases to the general public. You should
	not disclose any personal information, such as your real name,
	address, telephone number, email address, etc. Your username is the
	only identity that you need to have, and that is how people should
	know you on our site.
</p>
<p>
	We may disclose data we collect from Community members to a third party
	for educational research, business, and other purposes. Such data will never contain any
	personally identifiable information, and will not allow a third party to identify any
	individual user.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
	A "cookie" is a small piece of data placed on your computer by us.
	Within your web browser, cookies placed by our website can only be
	accessed by our website. We use cookies to
	maintain session and preference information to improve the use of the website.
	You may set your web browser to decline our
	cookies, however this will render large portions of our website
	unusable.
</p>
<p>
	We also allow cookies to be placed on your computer by third parties
	for the purpose of website analytics. This allows the third parties to
	collect data about your use of our website. The data collected by these cookies may include
	information such as your IP address or mobile identifier, the type of
	computer operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the
	user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information
	regarding the online or mobile service provider. We don't share the data that a
	third party collects with anyone besides that third party.
	The third parties are required to not share any personally identifiable
	information they may collect with anyone other than us (except as may be
	required by law). We use the data that is collected in the following
	ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		to report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use
		our website;
	</li>
	<li>
		to understand overall visitor behavior; and
	</li>
	<li>
		to inform how we update and improve our website.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Teachers using our Teacher Tools</h2>
<p>
	Teachers using our Teacher Tools on our website must first be
	members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We collect certain
	additional information from teachers wishing to use the Teacher
	Tools. We collect: your name, your school's name and address, a
	contact phone number and email address, and your school's website URL.
	We use this information to verify that you are a teacher at a
	legitimate educational institution or homeschool, to contact you
	regarding the Teacher Tools, and to share information about our services 
	with you. We may request from you other proof of
	school affiliation, as necessary, to determine your eligibility to use
	our Teacher Tools. We will not share this information with any third
	party (except as may be required by law).
</p>
<p>
	Teachers may enroll
	students in their classes using the Teacher Tools. In the case
	that such a student is under the age of 13, teachers agree that they,
	or their school, are acting as the students' parents' agent in
	providing consent for the online collection of students' personal
	information within the school context. (Please see
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools">
		this website from the Federal Trade Commission</a>
	for more information.) Please note that we will only use children's
	information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>
	Students enrolling in a class within their
	school, established by a registered teacher using our Teacher Tools
</h2>
<p>
	Students who enroll in a class set up by a registered teacher
	using our Teacher Tools
	do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We
	will collect your name, and you will also have to choose a unique
	username and password, which are both needed to log on. (If you are
	already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
	your already-existing username and password, but you may have to
	additionally provide your real name.) Your real name and username,
	along with other data that we have collected including (but not
	necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our
	Alcumus online educational system, will be shared with the teacher in
	whose class you are enrolling. We will not use this information for any other purpose,
	and will not share this information with any other third party (except
	as may be required by law). Please note that we will only use children's
	information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
</p>


<h2>Coaches using our Contest Platform</h2>
<p>
	Coaches using our Contest Platform on our website must first be members of the Art
	of Problem Solving community. Coaches may invite students to participate in contests
	in the Contest Platform. In the case that such a student is under the age of 13, coaches
	that are school representatives agree that they, or their school, have authority to act on
	behalf of the student and are providing consent on behalf of the parent/guardian for the
	collection of the student’s personal information for a school-authorized educational purpose.
	(Please see
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools">
		this website from the Federal Trade Commission</a>
	for more information.)
</p>

<h2>
	Students participating in contests on our Contest Platform
</h2>
<p>
	Students participating in contests that are invited by a school representative coach
	to use our Contest Platform do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community.
	In addition to the other information described herein, we will collect your name and other
	information required for participating in the contest that may include grade, age, parent contact
	information, proctor contact information, gender and ethnicity information, address, email, and
	consent for the contest organization to share your information with other educational institutions
	&amp; organizations. You will also have to choose a unique username and password, which are both
	needed to log on. (If you are already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
	your already-existing username and password.)
</p>
<p>
	Your real name and username, along with other data that we have collected including (but not
	necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our Contest Platform, will be shared
	with your coach and the third-party contest organization who is operating the contest.  We will not
	use this information for any other purpose, and will not share this information with any other third
	party, except as may be required by law and as outlined herein.
</p>

<h2>Customers purchasing a product or service</h2>

<p>
	We collect certain information from a customer who is purchasing a
	product and/or service using our online ordering system. Such
	information may include: your name, your shipping address, your
	billing address, your credit card information, other information related to
	other forms of payment (e.g., Paypal), your email address, and
	your phone number. This information is used to process your purchase
	and to contact you if there is an issue with your purchase. We will
	share this information with our credit card payment processor.
	Additionally, your name, shipping address, email address, and/or phone
	number may be shared with the United States Postal Service or other
	private carrier, for the purpose of delivering any purchased goods to
	your shipping address. We will store all of this information on our
	secure server, except for your credit card information, which is only
	retained until your payment has been processed and is not stored
	thereafter; however, this information may be retained by our credit
	card processor for the purpose of processing additional transactions,
	refunds, and/or chargebacks. We
	will not use this information for any purpose other than to process
	your purchase, and will not share this information with any other
	third party, except as described above or as may be required by law.
	We may use your name, phone number, and email address for marketing purposes, 
	but only if you give your permission to do so during the purchasing process, and such
	permission may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us (via the
	methods listed under "Contact Information" below). If you give your permission, 
	we may share that information with third parties for the purposes of sending emails 
	and texts and with third party social media platforms you may use to share updates and 
	information about our services/related services with you on those platforms. 
	Even if you opt out of such communication, however, we reserve the right to send you 
	transactional messages, including email and other communications to provide account related information,
	disclose maintenance, transaction-related matters (e.g., order confirmation, shipping information, 
	account status information, etc.) and other service-related issues.
</p>

<a name="job-app"></a>
<h2>Job Applicants</h2>

<p>
	If you apply for a job with Art of Problem Solving via our website or a third party website, 
	we will obtain the information you choose to provide us in your application for that purpose. 
	For example, we collect contact information (e.g. name, email, telephone); professional and 
	employment-related information (e.g. your resume, employment history, experience, qualifications, 
	portfolios, work samples); education information (e.g. degrees obtained, academic records); 
	other employment details (e.g. how you heard about the position, willingness to relocate, and 
	other job preferences); and information provided during the hiring process 
	(e.g. assessments, phone interviews, reference checks). 
	We will use the information we collect to carry out our application and recruitment process; 
	to improve our application and recruitment process, and to comply with applicable laws and 
	regulations and create reports required under local laws or regulations. 
	We may also optionally collect demographic information (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender, disability status) 
	that is collected for the sole purpose of creating reports required under local laws and regulations.
	By submitting a job application, you agree that we may contact you using any of the contact information provided.
</p>

<h2>How else may Art of Problem Solving use collected information?</h2>
<p>
	Consistent with the information collection practices outlined above, 
	we share information with service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, 
	professional, or technology support function for us (e.g., billing support, analytics, hosting, marketing, and similar services).  
	All service providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with applicable law. 
	We may combine the different types of information we collect in order to improve the site, perform analysis, or offer support. 
	Our practices conform with the law and the consent provided on behalf of students and children. 
	We may also disclose a user’s personal information if permitted or required by law, 
	for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
</p>
<p>
	In the event Art of Problem Solving is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of business assets 
	involving customer information, or similar transaction, 
	your information may be transferred or shared as part of the transaction. 
	We will work to require the recipient protect all personal information collected from 
	Art of Problem Solving users in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
	We implement commercially reasonable security methods to protect the
	information we collect from you. We maintain internal data management policies and procedures, 
	system monitoring, and incident response plans. While the security of your personal
	information is of the utmost importance to us, we cannot absolutely
	guarantee the security of any information you choose to disclose.

	The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you (for example, for as long as you are a customer or prospective customer) and the length of time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need to reference your personal information to address issues that may arise;
	</li>
	<li>
		Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</li>
	<li>
		Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
	</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h1><a name="coppa">COPPA Policy</a></h1>


<p>
	The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires
	that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use,
	or disclosure of personal information from children under the age of 13, and to
	obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any
	such information. If we discover we have collected information from a child in a
	manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either seek the parent's
	consent for that collection or delete the information. We won't require a child
	to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an
	activity.
</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect and share</h2>

<p>
	When we use the term "children" or "child", it refers to individuals under the age
	of 13. We may collect and share the following personal information with verifiable
	parental consent (where necessary under COPPA) from children:
</p>

<p>
	(a) Children may provide us their email address during registration or as part of
	receiving our services. We may use this email address to communicate directly with the
	child. 	If the child joins one of our email lists, their email address
	will be shared with the third party we use to manage our email lists.
	We will not otherwise share an email
	address with a third party except when required by law.

</p>

<p>
	(b) A username used to uniquely identify each child is created during
	registration. This username may be
	disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online
	classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may
	participate. Other members of the website may use the child's
	username to directly contact the child (for example, by private
	message or in online classroom discussions).
</p>

<p>
	(c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name.
	The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be
	disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific
	authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has
	requested access from the child to view the child's online school
	reports or a coach overseeing the child’s participation in a contest you
	have authorized to access your contest results. Such third parties must
	request permission from us before
	they request this information from the child, and we make a
	reasonable effort to determine if the third party has your consent and their request is
	legitimate before granting such permission. The child's real name
	will never be made publicly available on our website by us.
</p>

<p>
	(d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's
	participation on the website; for example, online homework submissions,
	live classroom discussions, etc. These data may be combined or associated
	with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site, at
	the child's or parent's discretion.
</p>

<p>
	(e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal
	information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on
	a blog or in our online classroom). Such information may be publicly
	displayed on the website alongside the child's username. We strongly discourage
	users from sharing personal information, but we cannot prevent it in every
	instance. This policy addresses how parents can delete information posted by
	their children in item #2 below.
</p>

<p>
	(f)  When children use our websites, certain information may automatically be
	collected by third parties: IP address or mobile identifier, the type of computer
	operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits
	various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online
	or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such
	as cookies, which are described above.
</p>

<p>
	This data is primarily collected and shared with third parties for internal
	purposes, in order to:
</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>
		report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use our website;
		</li>
		<li>
		understand overall visitor behavior; and
		</li>
		<li>
		inform how we update and improve our website.
		</li>
	</ul>
	This information
	is not used to target advertising to specific users.
	For any questions about how we or any third-party uses your data, please do
	not hesitate to contact us.  Our contact information is provided below in item #3.
</p>

<p>
	(g)  Children using our site may participate in contests hosted on the AoPS Contest
	Platform for a third-party organization responsible for operating the contest (“Contest
	Organization”).  These users are directed to AoPS by the Contest Organization.  Information
	collected for registration in the contest may include your child’s real name, grade, age,
	parent contact information (e.g., email and address), proctor contact information, and
	optional gender and ethnicity information.  This information will be shared with your
	child’s contest coach and the Contest Organization.
</p>

<p>
	(h) We may disclose a child’s personal information if permitted or required by law, for
	example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
</p>
<p>
	(i) We generally do not collect personal information from a child until we have received
	verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA. There are limited instances where we
	may collect information without parental consent in compliance with COPPA, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	An email address is collected from a child at the time of registration, solely to
	contact the child's parent in order to obtain the necessary parental consent;
	</li>
	<li>
	To protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology; and
	</li>
	<li>
	A username is selected by the child; however, this username cannot be used to contact
	the child, nor be used for the purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of above, unless
	and until we receive verifiable parental consent.
	</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. Parental rights and responsibilities</h2>
<ol class="part2" type="a">

	<li>
		At any time, a parent can review or ask us to delete a child's
		personal information, or can refuse to permit its further collection
		or use, by contacting us by any of the means listed in item #3 below.
	</li>
	<li>
		Parents may also access their child’s personal information by logging
		onto their child's account and can delete their child’s personal information.  Parents
		will need their child’s username and password, and our login page explains how
		parents can recover a username or password if they cannot recall this information.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Contact information</h2>

<p>
	Questions or comments about this policy, or requests pursuant
	to item #2 above, may be sent to:

	This COPPA Policy is current as of February 26, 2024. We may change this COPPA Policy
	from time to time, so please be sure to review periodically.  This policy will be
