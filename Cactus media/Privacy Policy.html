</div>
<div class="paragraph-title">(a) Cookies:</div>
<div class="policy-paragraph">
"Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may
write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer
about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us
in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what

</div>
<div class="paragraph-title">(b) Web Beacons:</div>
<div class="policy-paragraph">
A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an
image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user
identification to a database and associate you with previously
acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows
Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to
track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine
products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using
web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email
messages sent to individuals listed in Company's database.
</div>
<div class="paragraph-title">(c) IP Addresses:</div>
<div class="policy-paragraph">
Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your

research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better

may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the
site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is
assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local
area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are
automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a
user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an
individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used
to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address
can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or
which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP
addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and
their pages.

Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to
identify you.
