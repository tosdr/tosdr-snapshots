						<p><b>15. DISPUTES RESOLUTION : MANDATORY ARBITRATION & CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>
						<p>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM. IT IS PART OF YOUR CONTRACT WITH TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) AND CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURE FOR MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING CLASS ACTION. </p>
						<p><b>(A) MANDATORY ARBITRATION:</b>
							<p> DISPUTE NOTIFICATION</p>
							<p>In the case of disputes, controversies or claims involving TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ): You and TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement (including any question regarding their existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Arbitrate Agreement below. You agree to first give us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop applications. </p>
							<p>You can contact us and raise a ticket on https://support.TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ).io/sendtickets. </p>
							<p> ARBITRATE AGREEMENT</p>
							<p>In the case of disputes, controversies or claims involving TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ): You and TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement (including any question regarding their existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Arbitrate Agreement below. You agree to first give us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop applications or by contacting us via the link address given above in section (a). </p>
							<p>If we are not able to resolve your claims within 90 days of receiving the notice, you may seek relief through arbitration or in the Small Claims Tribunals of Singapore (“SCT”), as set forth below.</p>
							<p>PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION </p>
							<p>Either you or TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to resolve such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be incorporated into these Terms by reference. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration hearings shall be English and the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. </p>
							<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATE AGREEMENT </p>
							<p>Either party may instead choose to assert the claims in the SCT if the claims fall within the jurisdiction of the SCT, and either party may seek injunctive relief or other urgent equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, for the avoidance of doubt, where the claims fall outside of the jurisdiction of the SCT, the claims will be referred to and finally resolved by SIAC arbitration. </p>
							<p><b>(B) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL & CLASS ACTION</b></p>
							<p>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</p> 
						THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, as applicable, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. </p>
						<p>The Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
						<p> WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS</p>
						<p> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. </p>
						<p><b>(C) CONFIDENTIALITY</b></p>
					All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. However, this clause shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. </p>
					<p><b>(D) OTHER IMPORTANT CLAUSES OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</b></p>
					<p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. </p>
					<p>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
					<p> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a court of competent jurisdiction in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
					<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p> 
					<p><b>16. FORCE MAJEURE </b></p>
					<p>TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) is not responsible for damages caused by delay or failure to perform undertakings under this Agreement when the delay or failure is due to strikes, fires, floods, power outages or failures, acts of God or the state’s enemies, lawful acts of public authorities, any and all market movements, shifts, or volatility, computer, server, or Internet malfunctions, security breaches or cyberattacks, criminal acts, delays or defaults caused by common carriers, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other delays, defaults, failures or interruptions that cannot reasonably be foreseen or provided against. In the event of force majeure, TITAN PROJECTS( TTNEX & TITAN COIN, TTN ) is excused from any and all performance obligations and this Agreement shall be fully and conclusively at an end. </p>
