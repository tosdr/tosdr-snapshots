If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any personal information from or about a child under the age of 16, please <a href="https://doshsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">contact us</a>.</p><h2><strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</strong></h2><p>Personal Information and Anonymous Information - When you access or use the Services, we may collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you or your household (“Personal Information”), and we may also collect information that cannot reasonably be linked to you (“Anonymous Information”). When Anonymous Information is, directly or indirectly, associated or combined with Personal Information, such Anonymous Information will be considered Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><em>Information You Provide to Us</em>. In general, you may visit the Website or download the Application without telling us who you are or sharing any Personal Information with us. When you register for an account for the Services (an “Account”), use other aspects of the Services, or communicate with us for customer service or technical support for the Services, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address, postal address, mobile number, and payment account information. Additionally, if we are required by law for governmental and tax purposes, we may ask you to provide us or our service providers certain government identification numbers, including but not limited to your Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. We may also ask you whether you want to receive text messages relating to the Services. By providing your mobile phone number, you expressly consent to receive text messages from us relating to the Services at that number. Third-party data and message fees may apply. You may decline to provide certain Personal Information to us, but, if you do so, certain features of the Services may not be available to you or the performance of certain features of the Services may be limited or not work at all.</p><p><em>Information Collected from Devices</em>.

In addition, if you download the Application to your mobile Device, we may collect information from your mobile Device about your location while you are accessing or using the Application and while you are not accessing or using the Application. We may use this information to provide targeted offers to you and notify you of nearby third-party locations where you may use the Services. You may opt out of the collection of location data at any time by changing your settings on your mobile Device.

When you link an eligible credit or debit card (a “Payment Card”) to your Account, we may collect transaction information, from your Payment Card Network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) (“Transaction Information”). Transaction Information includes certain information about your transactions, last 4 digits of your card number, and merchant name. By linking a Payment Card to your Account, you authorize: (a) us to share your Payment Card information with the third parties that enable us to provide the Services, such as the payment processor Braintree (“Third-Party Service Providers”) and your Payment Card Network so it knows you enrolled for the Services; and (b) the Payment Card Network to (i) monitor transactions on your Payment Card to identify qualifying purchases in order to determine whether you qualify for or earn an offer linked to your Payment Card in connection with the Services; and (ii) share such Transaction Information with us to provide the Services to you. You may opt-out of such transaction monitoring on the Payment Card(s) you have registered by de-linking them through the Services or by terminating your Account. Please note that if you opt-out of transaction monitoring, certain features of the Services may not be available to you or the performance of certain features of the Services may be limited or not work at all. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, we will use Payment Card and transaction information solely as follows: to confirm a qualifying purchase or return to match transactions to confirm whether you qualify for an offer or statement credit; to create a record of the transaction information and thereafter maintain and use data in connection with the provision of Services; to provide targeted offers that may be of interest to you; to conduct analysis for the improvement and optimization of the Services; to inform participating merchants where a transaction occurred as needed for the merchant to confirm a specific transaction occurred or points should be awarded; for example, we may share the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase with its records or confirm if there is a missing or disputed transaction; to provide participating merchants aggregated and anonymized information relating specifically to registered Payment Card activity solely to allow participating merchants to assess the results of their campaign; to provide information in order to respond to a request from government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you or a merchant; and to enable the sharing, exchange and use of transaction information described above and herein by and among us, the Payment Card Networks, applicable Third-Party Service Providers and applicable merchants.</p><h2><strong>HOW WE USE PERSONAL AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</strong></h2><p>Anonymous Information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and for research and commercial purposes, such as to improve the Services. We may use Personal Information for our general commercial purposes including to: provide the Services and notices related thereto; analyze, improve and customize the Services; provide customer and technical support for the Services; send you announcements, newsletters, promotional materials, and other information about the Services and third-party products and services that we think may be of interest to you; detect, prevent and investigate actual or suspected fraud, hacking, infringement, or other misconduct involving the Services; collect fees and other amounts owed in connection with the Services; and comply with tax and other applicable laws.</p><h2><strong>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</strong></h2><p>We may share Anonymous Information with third parties as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and for our commercial purposes.
