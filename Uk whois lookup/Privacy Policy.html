<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>For the public</h2>

<p>While you use this site we will neither collect nor distribute any of
your private personal details. We will not know them. The only data
regarding your interaction with the site which we will record will be
your IP address and the pages you visit. This allows us to prevent
those with malicious intent from abusing the site. Such details are
retained for a maximum of 7 days unless malicious intent is determined
at which point they will be retained indefinitely. Your IP address is
shared with Nominet when you perform a non-cached WHOIS lookup
as per their terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The public section of this site sets no cookies.</p>

<h2>For registrants</h2>

<p>The purpose of this site is to provide access to the WHOIS
data as controlled by Nominet. Any of your private data which
is displayed as part of a WHOIS lookup is the data which you
have already granted to be publicly accessible as governed by <a
href="https://www.nominet.uk/domain-registration-tandc">your agreement
with Nominet</a>. <strong>If you wish to change or remove any of this data you
should contact your registrar</strong> or Nominet directly.</p>

<h2>For registrars</h2>

<p>This site makes use of registrars' public data including their
public support for the <a href="https://publicbenefit.uk/">PublicBenefit
campaign</a> to permit them to be displayed on the spinner. Registrars
who choose to sign up to this service will also provide details relating
to their tag which will be used for validation and for directing users to
their site from the spinner. Such data will be retained as long as the
registrar remains an active member of the site. The registrar's account
on the site may be closed at any time at which point such extra data
will be erased.</p>

<p>The private section of this site where registrars can manage their
accounts requires one cookie to be set for session control.</p>

<h2>For everyone</h2>

<p>Data is held within the United Kingdom and will not be transferred by
us to any other jurisdiction. Any data may be divulged to duly appointed
officers of the English courts upon legal compulsion.</p>
