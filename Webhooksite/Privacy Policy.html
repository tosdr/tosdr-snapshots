    <h2 id="terms">Terms of Use for Webhook.site</h2>

    <p>Last Updated: 6 February 2024.</p>

    <h3>1. Your Responsibilities</h3>

    <p>You are responsible for your conduct and any content/data sent to Webhook.site
        (hereafter known as "the Service").</p>

    <h4>1.1 Requirements for Service Usage</h4>


    <p>Users of the Service are expected to use the Service responsibly and legally.
        Violation of this
        policy may result in immediate termination of your account and access to the Service, at our
        sole discretion.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Users must ensure responsible conduct and manage any content or data sent to Webhook.site with care.</li>
        <li>
            The posting of illegal content, engaging in harassment, distributing malware, or conduct that
            is abusive, threatening, obscene, or defamatory is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>You may not misuse our Services by interfering with normal operation, or attempting
            to access them using a method other than through the interfaces and instructions that
            we provide.
        </li>
        <li>Using Webhook.site for any kind of <i>load testing</i>, <i>benchmarking</i> or
            otherwise stressing the system deliberately is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>You may not attempt to upgrade an account by any other means than through
            the official methods provided to you on the Service.
        </li>
        <li>Unless authorized by Webhook.site, you may not use any manual or automated system
            to scrape the content or extract data of content on Webhook.site that does not belong
            to yourself or your company.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>1.2 Fair Use</h4>

    <p>The following Fair Use Policy is enforced on a per-case basis and is in place to prevent any URL from
        causing interference to the Service in general, as described in section 1.1.
        A URL, IP address or IP range may be blocked
        and blacklisted at any time (resulting in a HTTP 429 error being served at the URL) if the
        Fair Use Guidelines listed below are exceeded, or if Webhook.site determines the URL to be
        causing significant interference to other users of the Service.
        If possible, the owner of the URL will be contacted as part of the process.</p>

    <p>Exceptions to the Fair Use Guidelines can be made, and if your usage is higher than listed in the
        Guidelines, we can whitelist your IP or Webhook.site URL. To request an exception,
        contact <a href="https://support.webhook.site">Webhook.site Support.</a></p>

    <p>Fair Use Guidelines apply to all subscription tiers.</p>

    <h5>1.2.1 Fair Use Guidelines</h5>

    <p>Per account:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Amount of URLs/e-mail addresses (also known as Tokens) created per day: 100 (with the
            <a href="https://docs.webhook.site/api/tokens.html#create-token">expiry</a> option set); 10
            (no expiry)
        </li>
        <li>Amount of incoming requests/e-mails created per minute: 1000</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Permission to Use</h3>

    <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these terms, Webhook.site grants
        you limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable revocable permission to access the
        services and use the Service for use during the Term at the level
        of service for which you have paid all applicable Fees.</p>

    <h3>3. Paid Subscriptions</h3>

    <p>Webhook.site provides different types of paid subscriptions.
        These subscriptions provide extra features as well as removal of some limitations
        for the URLs associated with the accounts.
    </p><p>A user, and the
        URLs associated with the users' account, will retain the upgraded status as long
        as their subscription is valid and their current payment period has been paid.
    </p><p>
        If the user cancels their subscription, the upgrade remains valid until the end of
        the subscription period.
    </p><p>
        If the payment is repeatedly rejected, the user is notified through the payment provider,
        and the URLs associated will lose the upgrade at that time and Webhook.site
        will automatically cancel the subscription.
    </p>

    <p>A list of features are listed
        <a href="https://docs.webhook.site/pro.html">in the documentation.</a></p>

    <h4>3.1 Refunds</h4>

    <p>A full refund of a subscription period can be
        issued at most 14 days after creating the subscription and requires a reason.
        To request a refund, contact <a href="https://support.webhook.site">Webhook.site Support</a>.</p>

    <h3>4. Service Responsibilities</h3>

    <h4>4.1 Uptime and Availability</h4>

    <p>The Service does not provide any guarantee of the availability, response time, uptime, throughput
        or any other kind of connectivity to the Service.</p>

    <h4 id="terms-4-2">4.2 Data Storage</h4>

    <p>For Webhook.site URLs not belonging to a Webhook.site account, or a Webhook.site account with a
        cancelled subscription, data may be automatically deleted after 7 days.</p>
    <p>For Webhook.site URLs belonging to a Webhook.site account with a paid subscription,
        data may be automatically deleted after a maximum of one year (365 days).</p>
    <p>Additionally, a maximum of 10000 requests or emails can be stored at any given URL, after which,

        available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.</p>

    <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Webhook.site shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
        indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use
        of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

    <h3>8. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Webhook.site, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and
        against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without

    <h3>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to its
        conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered
        a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
        remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>

    <h3>12. Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior
        agreements we might have between us regarding the Service. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience
        only and have no legal or contractual effect. The inability of Webhook.site to enforce any right or provision of
        these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>
