  <b>About this Cookie Policy</b>
</p>

<p>
  This Cookie Policy is provided as an addition to this site's Privacy Notice and exists to 
  explain what cookies are and how they are used on this site.
  Cookies are tiny text files that are stored within your web broswer 
  or hard drive when you visit
  a website or web applicaiton. These cookies allow servers to deliver content tailored
  to individual users or understand user behavior.
</p>

<p class="h6">
  <b>Types of Cookies we use</b>
</p>

<p>
  This site employs two first-party cookies (served from us and by us that are essential
  for the site to operate) and two third-party cookies that deliver external services.
</p>

<p class="h6">
  <b>First-Party Cookies</b>
</p>

<p>
  We use a server-generated session cookie to remember you when you are logged in to the 
  site. This is essential to making sure that your profile details are those that 
  are updated when you log in to make changes. This also lets us know who is logging 
  into the site and when.
</p>

<p>
  This site also uses a cookie that is created
  by your browser to remember when you agree to the cookie notice popup. This cookie
  stores nothing but the word "true" if you have agreed to the terms and is deleted when you
  close your browser. This cookie's only function is to prevent the cookie notice from 
  popping up every time you refresh the site's homepage.
</p>

<p class="h6">
  <b>Third-Party Cookies</b>
</p>

<p>
  This site uses Google Analytics to understand usage trends and server
  performance. We do not store variables which are personally-identifiable in Google Analytics 
  like browser ids or IP addresses. Google's privacy policy can be found
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>.
  If you would prefer have your browser stop supplying
  information to Google Analytics, Google provides a 
  <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">browser extension</a>
  to allow you to do so.
</p>

<p>
  This site also uses cookies supplied by Twitter when the Twitter sidebar script 
  is loaded on the homepage. Their cookie policy is available 
  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies">here</a>.
  Third-party cookies from Twitter are only loaded on this site's homepage and only
  when you agree to the terms or click the Twitter logo in the navigation bar.
</p>

<p class="h6">
  <b>How to Disable Cookies Altogether</b>
</p>

<p>
  Information on how to disable cookies in your browser can be found
  <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/">here</a>.
  Please keep in mind that disabling cookies will prevent the essential functions
  of most interactive websites and web applications, this site included.

    <p class="h4 mb-3">Privacy Notice</p>

<p>
  This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for (womenalsoknowstuff.com). This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
  </li>
  <li>
    What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
  </li>
  <li>
    The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
  </li>
  <li>
    How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="h6">
  <b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b>
</p>

<p>
  We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via completing your profile or from direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. However, as you are voluntarily providing your information to a publicly searchable database, anyone using the site will be able to access your information in the directory. 
  We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization. However, anything you enter into your directory profile is publicly searchable and available to anyone using the site.
  Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about changes to this privacy policy.
  Your Access to and Control Over Information 
  You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following 
  at any time by logging into your account/profile or by contacting us via email.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    See what data we have about you, if any. If you have not created a profile and entered in your information voluntarily, you will not be listed in the searchable directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change/correct any data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have us delete any data we have about you. You can delete information yourself by logging into your account and adjusting your profile as desired. Or you may email us at contact@womenalsoknowstuff.com and request that an administrator delete your entire profile from the system. Once this happens, your name and information will no longer appear on the site or be searchable publicly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
  </li>
</ul>


<p class="h6">
  <b>Security</b>
</p>

<p>
  We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
  Wherever we collect information (provided by you), such as professional information or account passwords, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
  While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. We do not have access to your account password, as this information is encrypted and not available to any other site users or administrators. If you forget your password, you may request a password reset. 
  If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately.
</p>
