        <div class="p-left-aligned-text text-margin-left-60">(d) In addition to the Processing Fees, the Organization shall promptly pay to Anedot any charge-backs, penalties or fines that may arise in connection with its Account.

Upon Anedot’s request, each of the Organizations shall promptly provide to Anedot a fully executed copy of any Billing Agreement and any amendments to such Billing Agreement (but in no event later than five (5) business days after execution).<br /></div>

          <p>THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU BY REASON OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR PROVIDED ON ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES OR OTHERWISE BY THIRD PARTIES OTHER THAN ANEDOT AND RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON ANY OF THE ANEDOT SERVICES OR RECEIVED THROUGH ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES.<br /></p>

ANEDOT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDRAISING SERVICES, THE ANEDOT PLATFORM OR ANY OF THE OTHER ANEDOT SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>19.6 Limitations by Applicable Law.</strong></p>
          <p>CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF WARRANTIES, REMEDIES OR LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTION WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED. <br /></p>
          <h3><strong>20. Export Controls.</strong></h3>

          <h3><strong>21. Miscellaneous.</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>21.1 Notice.</strong></p>
          <p>Anedot may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by email, regular mail or postings on any of the Anedot Services. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after the email is sent, unless Anedot is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, Anedot may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through any of the Anedot Services. In such case, notice will be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing. Notices posted on any of the Anedot Services are deemed given thirty (30) days following the initial posting.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.2 Waiver.</strong></p>
          <p>The failure of Anedot to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Anedot.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.3 Dispute Resolution.</strong></p>
          <p>If a dispute arises between you and Anedot, the goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective method of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Anedot agree that any dispute, claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms, the Fundraising Services, the Anedot Platform, the Site or any of the other Anedot Services (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) will be resolved in accordance with this Section 21.3 or as Anedot and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these dispute methods, Anedot strongly encourages you to first contact Anedot directly to seek a resolution.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>(a) Choice of Law.</strong> These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE ANEDOT SERVICES.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>(b) Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li><strong>ARBITRATION.</strong> YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ANEDOT (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE ANEDOT SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION AND YOU AND ANEDOT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN ENGLISH AND THE PLACE OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA. YOUR ARBITRATION FEES AND YOUR SHARE OF ARBITRATOR COMPENSATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH RULES. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND ANEDOT WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.<br /><br />Neither you nor Anedot will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any disputes covered by these Terms to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ANEDOT INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Anedot is a party to the proceeding.<br /><br />This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</strong> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate under Section 21.3(b) is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Anedot agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the federal or state courts covering Dover County, Delaware. Both you and Anedot irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Anedot may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.</li>
            <li><strong>Survival.</strong> This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your use of the Fundraising Services or any of the other Anedot Services or your relationship with Anedot.<br /></li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>(c) 30 Day Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 21.3 above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to help@anedot.com. The notice must be sent to Anedot within thirty (30) days of your use of any of the Anedot Services or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>(d) Improperly Filed Claims.</strong> All claims you bring against Anedot must be resolved in accordance with this Section 21.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 21.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 21.3, Anedot may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $15,000, provided that Anedot has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>(e) Prevailing Party. </strong>In the event that either party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other party arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any of the other Anedot Services, the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>(f) Limitation on Time to File Claims. </strong></p>
          <p>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE FUNDRAISING SERVICES OR ANY OF THE OTHER ANEDOT SERVICES OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANEDOT MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR DISPUTE IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.4 Severability.</strong></p>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms (including any Additional Agreements and Policies) is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.5 Relationship of the Parties.</strong></p>
          <p>The parties agree that nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, employer/employee, or similar relationship between the parties, or as authorizing either party to act as the agent of the other. You are and will remain an independent contractor in your relationship to Anedot. Nothing in these Terms shall create any obligation between either party and a third party.<strong> </strong><br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.6 Assignment.</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms and related Additional Agreements and Policies, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Anedot without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.7 Survival.</strong></p>
          <p>Upon termination of these Terms, your use of the Site, any of the other Anedot Services or your relationship with Anedot any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 and 9 – 21.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.8 Headings.</strong></p>
          <p>The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.9 Entire Agreement.</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, the Merchant Services Agreement, the Additional Agreements and the Policies, are the entire agreement between you and Anedot relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except by a change to these Terms or Policies made by Anedot as set forth in <strong>Section 8</strong> above or as provided in the Merchant Services Agreement and any Additional Agreement.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.10 No Agency.</strong></p>
          <p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.<br /></p>
          <p><strong>21.11 Geographic Restrictions.</strong></p>
