The lawful bases we rely on for processing your information are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We offer a public service for the protection of Telegram groups.
<ul>
<li>Telegram does not offer any feature to automatically protect groups, which is why our bot acts in the public interest in this regard, offering a mostly free service for protecting groups from any unwelcome external and internal attacks.</li>
<li>The manual group management functions provided directly by Telegram are incomplete or hard to be used: through our bot it is possible to greatly facilitate the action of administrators to protect their groups, compensating for the shortcomings of the platform itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We pursue the legitimate interest of groups and their group managers, who use our services also for 360-degree management of the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn't affect your rights, which are explained in detail later in this document.</p></div>

For each type of data collected it is specified how we collect them, why we collect them, who has access to them, how long we keep them and eventually if it's not possible to request their cancellation (only for data absolutely necessary for the public service offered by the bot).</p>
