                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Plato! Your use of Plato’s services, including the services Plato makes available through the Plato app, the Plato app website, and any other software or services offered by Plato in connection with any of those (the “Services”) is governed by these terms of use (the “Terms”), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Plato” refer to Plato Team Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.</p>
<p>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization or another individual, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization or individual and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization or individual to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will also refer to that organization or individual, wherever possible.</p>
<p>You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.</p>
<p>You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Plato or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<p>BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>
<h2>Your Account</h2>
<p>In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide Plato with certain information, such as a username (“Credentials”). Plato handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not Plato, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Plato of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your account has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify Plato immediately.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>A variety of games, information, reviews, recommendations, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, and other materials (&quot;Content&quot;) may be made available through the Services by Plato or its suppliers (“Plato-Supplied Content”). While Plato strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, Plato cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Plato-Supplied Content.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you may also be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services. All such information is referred to below as “User Content.” User Content also includes any information or data you include in any messages, invitations, or public or private chat messages you send or share through the Services.</p>
<p>You agree that there is no tolerance for Objectionable Content or abusive users. Content may be submitted to Plato, who will moderate all content and ultimately decide whether or not to post a submission to the extent such content includes, is in conjunction with, or alongside any, Objectionable Content. Objectionable Content includes, but is not limited to: (i) sexually explicit materials; (ii) obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, violent and/or unlawful content or profanity; (iii) content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or fraudulent; (iv) content that promotes the use or sale of illegal or regulated substances, tobacco products, ammunition and/or firearms.</p>
<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Plato has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Plato may suffer) in connection with such User Content. If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization or individual, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services. Furthermore, you acknowledge that Plato does not control or actively monitor Content uploaded by users and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Plato be liable in any way for any such Content.</p>
<p>You agree that you will not include in any User Content any personally identifiable information about any other person.</p>
<p>Plato may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. Plato may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, Plato may also delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable. You agree that Plato has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services.</p>
<p>Plato reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from Plato. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Plato to take down certain Content, Plato reserves the right to directly take down such Content.</p>
<h2>License from You</h2>
<p>By submitting, posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give Plato a worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license as set below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>with respect to User Content that you submit, post or otherwise make publicly or generally available via the Services (e.g. public forum posts), the license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute , publicly perform, and publicly display such User Content (in whole or part) worldwide via the Services or otherwise, and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for any legal business purpose; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with respect to User Content that you submit, post or otherwise transmit privately via the Services (e.g. via private chat messages with other Users), the license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display such User Content for the sole purpose of enabling Plato to provide you with the Services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proprietary Rights</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Plato (or Plato’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services and Plato-Supplied Content and that the Services and Plato-Supplied Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).<br>
Except as provided in Section 4, Plato acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you create, submit, post, transmit, share or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Plato, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Plato has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
<h2>License from Plato and Restrictions on Use</h2>
<p>Plato gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license is solely for your personal, non-commercial, recreational use, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<p>You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Services or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Plato, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); or (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Services or any applications running on the Services.</p>
<p>You may not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).</p>
<p>You may not access the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
<p>You may not access the Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Plato or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Services.</p>
<p>You agree that you will not upload, record, publish, post, link to, transmit or distribute User Content, or otherwise utilize the Services in a manner that: (i) advocates, promotes, incites, instructs, informs, assists or otherwise encourages violence or any illegal activities; (ii) infringes or violates the copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any third party or Plato, or any rights of publicity or privacy of any party; (iii) attempts to mislead others about your identity or the origin of a message or other communication, or impersonates or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with any other person or entity, or is otherwise materially false, misleading, or inaccurate; (iv) promotes, solicits or comprises inappropriate, harassing, abusive, profane, hateful, defamatory, libelous, threatening, obscene, indecent, vulgar, pornographic or otherwise objectionable or unlawful content or activity; (v) is harmful to minors; (vi) utilizes or contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or any other similar software, data, or programs that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, personal information, or property of another; or (vii) violates any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation (including without limitation the laws and regulations governing export control, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising) ; or (viii) otherwise violates these Terms or our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may not use the Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>
<h2>Pricing Terms</h2>
<p>The Services are currently provided to you free of charge. However, we may charge a fee for some parts of the Services at some point in the future. If we do so, we will provide you with information of the pricing for those portions of the Services at that point.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policies</h2>
<p>These Services are provided in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://platoapp.com/privacy">https://platoapp.com/privacy</a>. You agree to the use of your User Content and personal information in accordance with these Terms and Plato’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Modification and Termination of Services</h2>
<p>Plato is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Plato provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in its Privacy Policy. Changes to the form and nature of the Services will be effective with respect to all versions of the Services; examples of changes to the form and nature of the Services include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, automatic updates, and other enhancements. Any new features that may be added to the website or the Services from time to time will be subject to these Terms, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the Services. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account.</p>
<p>You agree that Plato, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate your account or any part thereof. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services may be without prior notice, and you agree that Plato will not be liable to you or any third party for such termination.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for exporting your Content from the Services prior to termination of your account for any reason, provided that if we terminate your account, we will endeavor to provide you a reasonable opportunity to retrieve your Content.</p>
<p>Upon any termination of the Services or your account these Terms will also terminate, but all provisions of these Terms which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms may be amended or updated from time to time without notice and may have changed since your last visit to the website or use of the Services. It is your responsibility to review these Terms for any changes. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop using the Services. Please visit this page regularly to review these Terms for any changes.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
<p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES ARE AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</p>
<p>PLATO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, PLATO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR, AND (C) USAGE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE.</p>
<p>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 11 AND 12, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT PLATO’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>SUBJECT TO SECTION 11 ABOVE, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT PLATO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY. THIS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS ON PLATO’S LIABILITY TO YOU IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT PLATO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>
<p>SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL PLATO’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SERVICES IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>
<h2>Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Plato, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners (collectively “Plato and Partners”) from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to (a) your breach of the Terms or the Privacy Policy, (b) your use of the Services, (c) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Services, (d) your User Content, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, of every kind and nature.</p>
