Out of cycle/cadence e-mails may or may not feature ads depending on a variety of factors.</p><h3 id=ad-timing>Ad Timing</h3><p>The newsletter is typically sent on Sundays at 0700 UTC. There may be weeks where due to life circumstances, travel, or timezone differences the newsletter is sent a day earlier or a day later but this is the exception not the rule.</p><p>Rates can change based on supply, demand, and subscribers. Rates should not change more than once a quarter or four times a year.</p><h3 id=ad-format>Ad Format</h3><p>Your ad will be featured <em>natively</em> in e-mails to all subscribers and on <a href=/>devopsish.com</a>. The native ad format guards against content blockers while maintaining the quality experience subscribers expect. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting.</p><p>Ads include a headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, <em>SPONSORED</em>. Total ad copy length excluding headline, call to action, and <em>SPONSORED</em> tag should not exceed 280 characters.</p><p>💡Think of ads in DevOps’ish as a tweet with a bolded headline on top and a call to action. 💡</p></section></article></main><footer class=footer><p><a href=/what-is-devops/ title="What is DevOps (free ebook)">What is DevOps?</a> &bull; <a href=/about/ title="About DevOps'ish">About</a> | <a href=https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com title=GitHub rel=nofollow>GitHub</a> | <a href=/cc-by-sa-4.0/ title="Copyright CC BY-SA 4.0" rel=nofollow>Copyright</a> | <a href=/terms/ title="Terms and Conditions" rel=nofollow>Terms</a> | <a href=/privacy/ title=Privacy rel=nofollow>Privacy</a> | <a href=/partners/ title=Partners>Partners</a></p></footer></body></html>
