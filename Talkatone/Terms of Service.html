                1.1 (Version No. 10. Effective Date: April 6, 2023) Please read these terms of use (“Agreement” or
                “Terms
                of
                Use”) carefully before using the services offered by <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talkatone</a> LLC (“Company” or “we”). This Agreement sets
                forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the various websites owned and operated
                by
                Company, including, without limitation, the <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.talkatone.com</a> website and domain name (“Sites”), and
                any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Company in connection
                therewith
                (collectively “Service”). By using the Sites or Service in any manner, including but not limited to
                visiting
                or browsing the Sites, you agree to be legally bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all
                users
                of the Sites or Service, including users who are also contributors of content, information, and other
                materials or services on the Sites.

                1.2 You understand and agree that the Service is intended for use only in the United States and Canada,
                and
                only United States or Canadian phone numbers are available under the Service. The Company is not
                responsible
                for users who voluntarily choose to use the Service outside the intended territories above. In addition,
                you understand and agree that
                any or all parts of the Service may not be available in certain parts of the United States and Canada.
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">2. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                2.1 The Service is offered subject to acceptance, without modification, of these Terms of Use and all
                other
                operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Sites by
                Company. In
                addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions
                promulgated by Company from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms
                and
                conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference.

                2.2 The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 16 years old. You represent and
                warrant
                that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are at least 16 years
                old, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. If you’re agreeing to
                these
                Terms of Use on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized
                to
                agree to these Terms of Use on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms of Use
                (in
                which case the reference to “you” and “your” in these Terms of Use, except for in this sentence, refer
                to
                that organization or entity). Company may, in its absolute sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service
                to
                any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">3. Modification of Terms of Use</h3>
                <p>
                    3.1 Company reserves the right, at its absolute sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the
                    Terms of Use, or change,
                    suspend, or discontinue the Service (including, without limitation, the availability of any feature,
                    database, or
                    content) at any time and in any manner by posting such changes on our website. You should review
                    this Agreement
                    regularly for changes and can easily identify if changes have been made by checking the “Effective
                    Date” at the top of
                    this page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Company may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or
                    all of the Service
                    without notice or liability.
                </p>
                <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms of Use, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means
                    you will no longer
                    be able to use the Services. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes
                    to the Terms of Use
                    constitutes acceptance of all of the changes.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">4. Privacy</h3>

                In the United States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online
                service
                providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or
                send
                any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a
                child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as reasonably possible. If you believe that a
                child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="https://www.talkatone.com/#support">support@talkatone.com</a>.

                To the extent the Company processes any personal data on behalf of the customer in connection with the
                provision of the Service and (a) the personal data relates to individuals located in the EEA; or (b) the
                customer is located in the EEA, the parties agree that such personal data will be processed in
                accordance
                with the Data Processing Addendum set out in Schedule A (“DPA”). In the event of any conflict between
                the
                remainder of the Agreement and the DPA, the DPA will prevail.

                For the purposes of this section 4, the terms “personal data”, “process” and “EEA” have the meanings
                given
                in the Data Processing Addendum.
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">5. Company and Content</h3>
                5.1 The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not
                limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (as defined

                and
                restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy,
                reproduce,
                modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or
                otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the
                owner
                of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Company’s) rights.

                5.2 You understand that Company owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in
                the
                transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works

                The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this
                functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

                6.1 As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Service for any purpose that is prohibited by

                not
                on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws
                that
                apply to you. You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Service. If your use
                of
                the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services.

                6.2 By way of example, and not as a limitation, you shall not (and shall not permit any third party to)
                either (i) take any action or (ii) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate

                    <li>jeopardizes the security of your account or anyone else’s account (such as allowing someone else

                    <li>involves commercial activities and/or sales without Company’s prior written consent, such as

                        schemes, or any
                        other use to generate income for yourself or others as a result of calling numbers through the
                        Service

                    <li>involves unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for

                </ul>
                6.3 Additionally, you shall not: (i) take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined by
                Company
                in its absolute sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Company’s (or its
                third
                party providers’) infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the
                Service or any activities conducted on the Service; (iii) bypass any measures Company may use to prevent
                or
                restrict access to the Service (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the
                Service);
                or (iv) run Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or spamming on the Service.

                6.4 You shall not (directly or indirectly): (i) decipher, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or
                otherwise attempt to derive any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any part of the

                6.5 Company reserves the right to remove any Content from the Sites or Service at any time, for any
                reason
                (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities
                relating to such Content or if Company is concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Use), or
                for

                (10) days prior notice to you, which may be posted on the Sites or other public channels. Use of the

                websites

                at
                your own risk. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there
                are
                risks in doing so and that Company is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when
                you
                leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website

                without cause, at any time, and effective immediately by following the instructions on the Sites.

                11.3 To understand how Company treats information you provide after you stop using the Service, please
                refer to Company’s Privacy Policy at http://www.talkatone.com/privacy.html.

                Terms of Use, you may be able to receive a pro-rata refund if you live in a jurisdiction that provides
                for
                such pro-rata refunds.

                11.5 All provisions of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
                limitations of liability.
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">12. Account Inactivity and Phone Number Ownership</h3>
                12.1 If Company provides a phone number (“Company Number”) to you, you understand and agree that you do
                not
                own the number or have a right to keep that Company Number forever. Company may change or withdraw your
                Company Number from time to time for any reason upon notice to you.

                12.2 Company may reclaim the Company Number you received through the Service (if you have one) if you have not placed calls or text messages (“Inactivity” or “Inactive”) for a period of thirty (30) days. However, you may be eligible for the Company Number Phase Out (described below) before Company reclaims your Company Number. We will not reclaim numbers that you have ported to the Service.

                12.3 <i><u>Company Number Phase Out</u></i>: If you have a Company Number and you have any prepaid
                credits in your account, your prepaid credits may be deducted from
                your account following thirty (30) days of Inactivity in thirty (30) credit increments. Following every
                thirty (30) days
                of Inactivity, thirty (30) prepaid credits will be deducted from your account. If you have less than
                thirty (30) credits
                in your account at any time during a thirty (30) day period of Inactivity, all of your remaining prepaid
                credits will be
                deducted at the same time. In addition, if your account has been Inactive for one hundred eighty (180)
                consecutive days,
                all of your remaining prepaid credits will be deducted at the same time. Once your account has been
                Inactive for a
                period of thirty (30) days after your prepaid credit balance has reached zero, Company may reclaim the
                Company Number
                associated with such account. Please note that if you begin using the Company Number before Company
                reclaims it, you
                will not receive any refund or restoration of prepaid credits.
                <h3 class="mb-3 mt-4">13. International/Non-California Use</h3>

                the
                Controller and Talkatone is the Processor.

                2.2 <b>Instructions for Data Processing.</b> Talkatone will only Process Customer Personal Data in
                accordance with customer’s written instructions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreement
                (subject to any changes to the Service agreed between the parties) and this DPA shall be customer’s
                complete
                and final instructions to Talkatone in relation to the processing of Customer Personal Data.

                2.3 Processing outside the scope of this DPA or the Agreement will require prior written agreement
                between
                customer and Talkatone on additional instructions for Processing.

                2.4 <b>Required consents.</b> Where required by applicable Data Protection Laws, customer will ensure
                that
                it has obtained/will obtain all necessary consents and complies with all applicable requirements under
                Data
                Protection Laws for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by Talkatone in accordance with the
                Agreement.
                <p class="bold">3. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</p>
                3.1 <b>Authorised Subprocessors.</b> Customer agrees that Talkatone may use Subprocessors to Process
                Customer Personal Data. The list of Subprocessors currently engaged by Talkatone and authorized by
                Customer,
                as of May 25, 2018, is available at https//oomainc.box.com/v/talkatone-subprocessor-list.

                3.2 Talkatone shall notify customer from time to time of the identity of any Subprocessors engaged. If
                customer (acting reasonably) objects to a new Subprocessor on grounds related to the protection of
                Customer
                Personal Data only, then without prejudice to any right to terminate the Agreement, customer may request
                that Talkatone move the Customer Personal Data to another Subprocessor and Talkatone shall, within a
                reasonable time following receipt of such request, use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the original
                Subprocessor does not Process any of the Customer Personal Data. If it is not reasonably possible to use
                another Subprocessor, and customer continues to object for a legitimate reason, either party may
                terminate
                the Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice. If customer does not object within thirty (30) days of
                receipt of the notice, customer is deemed to have accepted the new Subprocessor.

                3.3 Save as set out in clauses 3.1 and 3.2, Talkatone shall not permit, allow or otherwise facilitate
                Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data without customer’s prior written consent and unless
                Talkatone:
                <ul class="inline_list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>enters into a written agreement with the Subprocessor which imposes equivalent obligations on
                        the
                        Subprocessor with regard to their Processing of Customer Personal Data, as are imposed on
                        Talkatone under
                        this DPA; and</li>
                    <li>shall at all times remain responsible for compliance with its obligations under the DPA and will
                        be
                        liable to customer for the acts and omissions of any Subprocessor as if they were Talkatone’s
                        acts and
                        omissions.</li>
                </ul>
                3.4 <b>International Transfers of Customer Personal Data.</b> To the extent that the Processing of
                Customer
                Personal Data by Talkatone involves the export of such Customer Personal Data to a third party in a
                country
                or territory outside the EEA, such export shall be:
                <ul class="inline_list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>to a country or territory ensuring an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms

                        Subjects as determined by the European Commission;</li>
                    <li>to a third party that is a member of a compliance scheme recognised as offering adequate
                        protection for
                        the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects as determined by the European Commission; or</li>
                    <li>governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses between the customer as exporter and such third
                        party as
                        importer. For this purpose, the customer appoints Talkatone as its agent with the authority to
                        complete
                        and enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses as agent for the customer on its behalf.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">4. DATA SECURITY, AUDITS AND SECURITY NOTIFICATIONS</p>
                4.1 <b>Talkatone Security Obligations.</b> Talkatone will implement and maintain appropriate security
                measures to safeguard the security of Customer Personal Data. Talkatone will maintain an information

                integrity and accessibility of Personal Data with administrative, technical and physical measures
                conforming
                to the generally recognised standards and practices. Talkatone shall implement appropriate technical and
                organisational measures to protect Customer Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
                alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. Customer acknowledges and agrees that these measures
                ensure a
                level of security that is appropriate to the risk.

                4.2 Upon customer’s reasonable request, Talkatone will make available all information reasonably
                necessary
                to demonstrate compliance with this DPA.

                4.3 <b>Security Incident Notification.</b> If Talkatone becomes aware of a Security Incident, Talkatone
                will (a) notify customer of the Security Incident within 72 hours, (b) investigate the Security Incident
                and
                provide customer and any law enforcement or regulatory official with reasonable assistance as required
                to
                investigate the Security Incident.

                4.4 <b>Talkatone Employees and Personnel.</b> Talkatone will treat the Customer Personal Data as
                confidential, and shall ensure that any employees or other personnel have agreed in writing to protect
                the
                confidentiality and security of Customer Personal Data.

                4.5 <b>Audits.</b> Talkatone will, upon customer’s reasonable request and at customer’s expense, allow
                for
                and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by customer (or a third party auditor on
                customer’s behalf and mandated by customer) provided (i) such audits or inspections are not conducted
                more
                than once per year (unless requested by a Supervisory Authority); (ii) are conducted only during
                business
                hours; and (iii) are conducted in a manner that causes minimal disruption to Talkatone’s operations and
                business.
                <p class="bold">5. ACCESS REQUESTS AND DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</p>
                5.1 <b>Data Subject Rights.</b> Where applicable, and taking into account the nature of the Processing,
                Talkatone will use reasonable endeavours to assist customer by implementing appropriate technical and

                respond
                to requests for exercising Data Subject rights laid down in the Data Protection Laws.
                <p class="bold">6. DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PRIOR CONSULTATION.</p>
                6.1 To the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, Talkatone will provide customer with
                reasonably requested information regarding its Service to enable customer to carry out data protection
                impact assessments or prior consultations with any Supervisory Authority, in each case solely in
                relation to
                Processing of Customer Personal Data and taking into account the nature of the Processing and
                information
                available to Talkatone.
                <p class="bold">7. TERMINATION</p>
                7.1 <b>Deletion or return of data.</b> Subject to 7.2 below, Talkatone will, at customer’s election and
