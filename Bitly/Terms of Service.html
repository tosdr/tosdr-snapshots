This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards[5];</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(iii) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</span></p> <p class="indentme" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).

The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the controller or the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.
