<p><em>MIT Center for Mobile Learning</em></p>

<p>Welcome to MIT’s Center for Mobile Learning’s App Inventor website
(the “Site”).  The Site runs on Google’s App Engine service. You must
read and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
(collectively, the “Terms”) prior to using any portion of this
Site. These Terms are an agreement between you and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. If you do not understand or do not agree to
be bound by these Terms, please immediately exit this Site.</p>

<p>MIT reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time and will
publish notice of any such modifications online on this page for a
reasonable period of time following such modifications, and by
changing the effective date of these Terms. By continuing to access
the Site after notice of such changes have been posted, you signify
your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure to return to this page
periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of
these Terms.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-mit-app-inventor">Description of MIT App Inventor</h2>

<p>From this Site you can access MIT App Inventor, which lets you develop
applications for Android devices using a web browser and either a
connected phone or emulator. You can also use the Site to store your
work and keep track of your projects. App Inventor was originally
developed by Google. The Site also includes documentation and
educational content, and this is being licensed to you under the
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
license</a></p>

<h2 id="account-required-for-use-of-mit-app-inventor">Account Required for Use of MIT App Inventor</h2>

<p>In order to log in to MIT App Inventor, you need to use a Google
account. Your use of that account is subject to Google’s Terms of
Service for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is
governed by Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/preview/">Privacy
Policy</a>.  MIT has no
access to your Google account or the information you provide for it
other than the account email address, which we may use to contact
you. In the future, the Center for Mobile Learning may provide
alternative means for using MIT App Inventor without Google accounts,
at which point we will update these terms of use to reflect those
alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="information-about-you">Information about You</h2>

<p>Beyond the name of your Google account, you do not have to tell us
anything about yourself to download the App Inventor setup software or
use the MIT App Inventor Web site. From time to time, we will give you
the option of telling us some things about yourself, but you do not
have provide this information if you don’t want to. Please understand
that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you
consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such
Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with these Terms,
and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these
Terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable
Information to us.</p>

<p>We track information indicating, among other things, which pages of
our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they
were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls
were used. We also track information about user projects and how those
projects are developed when connected to Android devices.</p>

<p>We may log the IP address, operating system and browser software
used by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an
IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic
location of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analysis
tools are used to collect this information. Some of the information is
collected through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer). You
should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web
browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject
cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.</p>

<p>Among other things, we may use the
information that you provide (including your Personally Identifiable
Information) in connection with the following</p>

<ul>
  <li>In order to debug and improve the MIT App Inventor system.</li>
  <li>For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in
the areas of how people learn and create with MIT App Inventor.</li>
  <li>For the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal
information, for example to respond to a specific inquiry or provide
you the specific course and/or services you select.</li>
  <li>To publish information gathered about learning and creating with
MIT App Inventor but only as non-personally identifiable data.</li>
  <li>As otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sharing-with-third-parties">Sharing with Third Parties</h2>

<p>We may share the information we collect with third parties as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>With service providers or contractors that perform certain
functions on our behalf, including processing information that you
provide to us on the Site or operating the Site or portions of
it. These service providers and contractors will be obligated to keep
your information confidential.</li>
  <li>With research collaborators, but only under the condition that they
are obligated to keep any personally identifying information
confidential.</li>
  <li>To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in
response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another
government agency, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
illegal activities, suspected fraud, or to enforce our user agreement
or privacy policy, or to protect our rights or the rights of
others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-apps-you-create">The Apps You Create</h2>

<p>By creating and storing apps on the MIT App Inventor server you
represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the apps,
(i) that you have the authority to authorize MIT to store the apps on
the MIT App Inventor Server and (ii) you will use the apps in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not MIT,
are solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.</p>

<p>MIT has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with MIT App
Inventor. These apps belong to you. Your apps are stored on the MIT
App Inventor server. You have the right to download your apps and
delete them from the server at any time. If you delete an app, there
is the possibility that MIT may be able to continue to access it from
the backups we keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these
backups are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term
preservation. MIT will strive to keep your apps and your account
accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation
to do so, and MIT has no liability for the consequences of the service
becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable.  We therefore
strongly suggest that you maintain backup copies of valuable apps at
places besides the MIT App Inventor server.</p>

<h2 id="user-postings">User Postings</h2>

<p>MIT App Inventor has a gallery for sharing apps, user profile
information and commentary. You agree that you are responsible for
your own use of the Site and your User Postings. “User Postings”
include all projects, applications and content submitted, posted,
published or distributed on the Site by you or other users of the
Site.</p>

<p>By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you affirm,
represent, and warrant that you are the creator and owner of or have
the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to reproduce
and publish the User Postings, and to authorize MIT and the Site’s
users to reproduce, modify, publish, and otherwise distribute your
User Postings as necessary to exercise the license granted by you
below. You, and not MIT, are solely responsible for your User Postings
and the consequences of posting or publishing them.</p>

<p>All content and projects on this Site are licensed under the
Creative Commons Attribution- ShareAlike 4.0 International
License. Therefore, by submitting any User Posting you hereby license
it under the CC SA license, which permits anyone to view, modify, and
redistribute these materials.</p>

<p>MIT has no proprietary rights in your User Postings. You have the
right to download or delete them from the server at any time.</p>

agree that you will use the Site in compliance with these Terms of
Service and all applicable local, state, national, and international
laws, rules and regulations, including copyright laws and any laws
regarding the transmission of technical data exported from your
country of residence and all United States export control laws. You

<h2 id="special-information-for-schools">Special Information for Schools</h2>

<p>MIT App Inventor values its relationship with the educational
community and is honored that many educators have found MIT App
Inventor to be a valuable tool for classroom learning.  MIT also
values the privacy of its users as explained in the MIT App Inventor
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  As many states have now passed laws
regarding the use of online platforms in the classroom, MIT App
Inventor has been asked to execute certain “addenda” to service
contracts in order to continue the use of MIT App Inventor for
classroom use.  MIT App Inventor is unable to execute agreements of
these sort as it does not maintain contractual agreements with school
districts as part of this service. Instead, MIT App Inventor is a
free, online tool available to anyone who registers for an account.
If you are seeking to use MIT App Inventor for classroom use, we have
developed a different version of the platform which does not collect
or maintain any personally identifiable information (PII).  This
version is available at
<a href="http://code.appinventor.mit.edu">http://code.appinventor.mit.edu</a> and
may be more appropriate for your use.  If you have any additional
questions, please contact us at appinventor@mit.edu.</p>
