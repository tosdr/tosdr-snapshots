  <p><strong>Posted on: 31 May 2023</strong>  
 <strong>Effective Date: 1 July 2023</strong></p>

  <p>These General Terms of Service (the ‘General Terms’) are a legal joint supply agreement between you (‘you’ or ‘your’), Squareup Europe Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with company number 08957689 with a registered office at 6th Floor, One London Wall, London, EC2Y 5EB (‘Square Europe’) and Squareup International Limited, a company incorporated in Ireland with company number 583287 whose registered office is at 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland (‘Square International’ and together with Square Europe, ‘Square’, ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’). These General Terms govern your use of Square’s services, including mobile applications, websites, software, cloud-based solutions, hardware and other products and services in the United Kingdom (collectively, the ‘Services’), whether such Services are offered by Square Europe, Square International or a subsidiary or an affiliate of either such company (each, a ‘Square Company’ and collectively, ‘Square Companies’). Effective upon the earlier of your clicking “Accept” or your use of any of the Services, you accept and agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (‘Policies’), including terms that limit Square’s liability (see Section 15) and require arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 18). You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (the ‘Additional Terms’). If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you are accepting these General Terms and have authority to enter into these General Terms, on behalf of that business. Those Additional Terms become part of your agreement with us, including those listed below. You should read all of the terms carefully.</p>

  <p><a href="/gb/legal/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>: Those provisions of the Privacy Notice for Users Who Apply or Sign Up for a Square Account or Other Services (‘Privacy Notice’) that are applicable to you as a merchant apply when you use the Services.</p>

  <p><a href="/gb/legal/data-processing-terms">Data Processing Terms</a>: These terms (‘Data Processing Terms’) govern the processing by Square of your customers’ and your employees’ personal data. These terms will apply to the processing of your customers’ and employees’ personal information by Square in the course of providing you with the Services.</p>

  <p><a href="/gb/legal/payment">Payment Terms</a>: These terms (‘Payment Terms’) apply to all Payment Services.</p>

  <p><a href="/gb/legal/saas">SaaS and Services Terms</a>: These terms (‘SaaS Terms’) govern your license to Square intellectual property, including the Square Point-of-Sale application and Cash App, and your use of certain Services.</p>

  <p><a href="/gb/legal/instant-transfer-terms">Instant Transfer Terms</a>: These terms (‘Instant Transfer Terms’) apply to your use of Instant Transfers.</p>

  <p><a href="https://squareup.com/gb/legal/pos">Additional Point of Sale Terms of Service</a>: These terms (‘Additional Point of Sale Terms’) apply to your use of certain additional products and services offered by Square, such as gift cards.</p>

  <h3 id="privacy"><strong>1. Privacy</strong></h3>

  <p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

  <p>By using any of our Services as a Square Seller, you acknowledge our data practices that apply to you, as set out in the Square Account holder Privacy Notice (the ‘Privacy Notice’). The Privacy Notice explains how Square collects, uses and protects the personal information you provide to us where Square makes use of your personal data to provide you with the Services or for its own purposes. You are required to familiarize yourself with the Privacy Notice prior to using the Services.</p>

  <p>YOUR CUSTOMERS’ AND EMPLOYEES’ PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

  <p>Square will process certain of your customers’ or employees’ personal information on behalf of your business as a service provider (‘data processor’). The <a href="/gb/legal/data-processing-terms">Data Processing Terms</a> will govern the processing by Square of your customers’ and your employees’ personal data. In such circumstances, you agree that you will comply with the data protection laws applicable to you and will provide data subjects with information on the processing of their personal information which satisfies the transparency requirements of such data protection laws and which ensures that personal information may be processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner</p>

  <h3 id="square-account-registration"><strong>2. Square Account Registration</strong></h3>

  <p>You must open an account with Square (a ‘Square Account’) to use the Services. During registration, Square will ask you for information, including your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to Square’s questions and keep that information current by updating Square Support. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Square Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to the Square Account. Square reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Square Account of any user who provides inaccurate, untrue or incomplete information or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements.</p>

  <h3 id="revisions-disclosures-and-notices"><strong>3. Revisions, Disclosures and Notices</strong></h3>

  <p>Each of Square International and Square Europe may amend the General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies at any time with notice that it deems to be reasonable in the circumstances, by posting the revised version on Square’s website (the ‘Square Website’) or communicating it to you through the Services (each, a ‘Revised Version’). Each Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version. However, any Dispute (as defined in Section 17) that arose before the changes will be governed by the General Terms, Additional Terms or Policies in place when the Dispute arose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Payment Terms may be varied only in accordance with the provisions set out in Section 37 of the Payment Terms.</p>

  <p>You agree to Square’s <a href="/gb/legal/sign">E-Sign Consent</a>. Unless applicable (a) laws, (b) regulatory requirements, including the Payment Services Regulations 2017 or (c) mandatory standards or codes of practice of any competent authority (collectively, ‘Applicable Law’) require an alternative or specific method of communication, you agree that any Square Company may electronically provide or make available to you (as relevant) any Communication (as defined below), by (i) posting it on the Square Website, (ii) pushing notifications through the Services, (iii) emailing it to the email address listed in your Square Account, (iv) sending you a text message to the primary mobile phone number you have listed in your Square Account, (v) uploading it to your Square Account or (vi) making the Communications otherwise accessible via the Square Website or other applications. In such circumstances, a Communication has the same meaning and effect as if such Square Company had provided you with paper copies. A Communication is considered received by you twenty-four (24) hours after it is issued, unless the relevant Square Company receives notice that it was not delivered.</p>

  <p>If you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic Communications, you should contact Square Support. Any withdrawal of your consent will be effective four weeks after Square Support receives your email. If Square Companies are not able to communicate with you otherwise than electronically as set out in this Section 3, you may need to terminate your Square Account or your use of certain or all of the Services.</p>

  <p>You have the right to receive a Communication in paper form. To request a paper copy of any Communication at no charge, please email Square Support no later than 180 calendar days of the date the Communication was issued.</p>

  <p>You can change your email address by emailing Square Support. You may also be able to change your email address through your Square Account.</p>

  <p>A ‘Communication’ includes but is not limited to any: (a) disclosure, (b) notice, (c) agreement or policy such as the Additional Terms, (d) payment authorisation or transaction receipt or confirmation, (e) account statement or history or (f) relevant tax statement or document or any other written information relating to your Square Account or your use of the Services.</p>

  <h3 id="restrictions"><strong>4. Restrictions</strong></h3>

  <p>You may not directly or indirectly export the Services. The Services may be subject to export restrictions imposed by Applicable Law. You may not, nor may you permit any third party to: (a) access or monitor any material or information on any Square Company system using any manual process or robot, spider, scraper or other automated means; (b) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell or distribute in any way material, Services or information from any Square Company; (c) use and benefit from the Services via a rental, lease, timesharing, service bureau or other arrangement; (d) transfer any rights granted to you under these General Terms; (e) violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on any Service, work around, bypass or circumvent any of the technical limitations of the Services, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Services or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Services, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by Applicable Law; (f) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of the Services, prevent access to or use of the Services by any person that signs up for a Square Account to use Payment Services (a ‘Square Seller’) or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Square International’s infrastructure; (g) use the Services in a way that distracts or prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws; (h) use the Services for the sale of firearms, firearm parts, ammunition, weapons or other devices designed to cause physical harm; (i) use the Services for any illegal activity or goods or in any way that exposes you, other Square Sellers, any Square Company or any of their partners to harm; or (j) otherwise use the Services except as expressly allowed under this these General Terms and applicable Additional Terms and Policies.</p>

  <p>If Square reasonably suspects that your Square Account has been used for an unauthorised, illegal or criminal purpose, you give Square express authorisation to share information about you, your Square Account and any of your transactions with law enforcement.</p>

  <h3 id="compatible-mobile-devices-and-third-party-carriers"><strong>5. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers</strong></h3>

  <p>Neither Square International nor Square Europe warrants that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or carrier.

  <h3 id="paid-services"><strong>9. Paid Services</strong></h3>

  <p>Square Services include both paid-for Services (‘Paid Services’) and free Services for which no fees are charged (‘Free Services’).  Square International may offer certain Paid Services to be paid on a recurring basis (‘Subscription Services’), and others on an as-used or transactional basis (‘A La Carte Services’). Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable Taxes (‘Subscription Fee’). A La Carte Services may subject you to fees charged per usage and/or terms, including transaction volume. By using an A La Carte Service, you agree to pay the fees and any Taxes incurred at the time of usage (‘A La Carte Fees’ and, together with Subscription Fees, the ‘Paid Service Fees’).</p>

  <p>In general, Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card or deducted from your transaction proceeds. If you link a debit or credit card to your account, you authorise Square Europe, as a collection agent for Square International, to collect Paid Service Fees by debit from your linked debit card or charge to your linked credit card. Regardless of payment device or method, Square Europe reserves the right to collect Paid Service Fees, as a collection agent for Square International, by deduction from your transaction proceeds, the Balance (as defined in the <a href="/gb/legal/payment">Payment Terms</a>) in your Square Account or your linked bank account.</p>

  <h3 id="taxes"><strong>10. Taxes</strong></h3>

  <p>For purposes of these Terms, “Tax” and “Taxes” include any and all present or future taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments, including, without limitation, income, telecommunications, value-added, goods and services tax or similar tax, stamp tax or duty, gross receipts, excise, real or personal property, sales, withholding, social security, occupation, use, severance, environmental, licence, net worth, payroll, employment, franchise, transfer and recording taxes, fees and charges, imposed by any domestic or foreign taxing authority, including any penalties, interest or additions to tax.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise expressly stated, all Paid Services Fees are exclusive of any Taxes, including any value-added tax, goods and services tax or similar tax (‘VAT’). You are responsible and liable for identifying and calculating any and all Taxes, including any VAT, required to be assessed, incurred, collected, paid or withheld for your use of the Services. Unless otherwise expressly stated, You also are responsible and liable for (a) determining whether Taxes, including any VAT, apply to your sale of products and services, payments received, and/or any other transactions arising from or out of your use of the Services, (b) registering with Tax authorities in jurisdictions where you are required to do so by applicable law, and (c) calculating, collecting, reporting, paying and/or remitting any such applicable Taxes, including any VAT, to the appropriate Tax and revenue authorities and you agree to fully indemnify, defend, and hold Square harmless against any such Taxes and any other related expenses or costs. Square specifically disclaims any liability for such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, You agree that we are not a marketplace, marketplace facilitator, marketplace provider, or similar construct under any applicable law relating to VAT, sales, use or similar taxes, nor do the Services hereunder provide a marketplace or similar construct, and You agree to not take any tax position to the contrary, including on any tax return, tax filing, in any tax audit or examination or otherwise.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Square may charge applicable Taxes on Services, including any VAT, as required by law, which you agree to pay, unless you provide Square with timely appropriate, complete, and accurate information and documentation satisfying the legal and tax requirements of the relevant governmental or tax authority to establish that the otherwise applicable VAT is not required to be charged by Square. You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold Square harmless against any Tax, including any VAT, imposed by a Tax authority for failure to apply correct Taxes, including VAT, if such failure is a result of your failure to provide Square with the correct evidence to support your exemption from such Taxes, including VAT, as applicable</p>

  <p>Square may be obligated under applicable laws to report certain information to Tax and revenue authorities (‘Tax Information’) and/or you with respect to your use of the Services. Upon request, you shall provide Square with the necessary information to complete any applicable Tax Information reporting and recertify such information from time to time, as may be required by applicable law, or otherwise in connection with any Tax audit or examination. If you use our Services you acknowledge that we will report to the applicable tax and revenue authorities the required Tax Information (including the total number and amount of payments you received during the relevant reporting period). We also may, but are not obligated to, send to you the Tax Information reported.</p>

  <p>If applicable, Square shall be entitled to deduct from any payments to you the amount of any applicable withholding Taxes with respect to amounts payable, or any other Taxes, in each case required to be withheld by Square to the extent that Square remits to the appropriate Tax authority on your behalf such Taxes. Any amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated as having been paid for all purposes of these Terms and Square will not be obliged to increase or gross-up any payment on account of any withholding of Tax.</p>

  <p>You acknowledge and agree that Square is not providing any Tax advice and nothing Square says or provides to you should be interpreted as such. For any Tax-related inquiries in connection with the Services or these Terms, you should consult your own Tax or legal advisor.</p>

If this warranty is breached, you must notify Square Support as soon as possible. You must give Square Support a reasonable time to fix the problem, which solution may include (a) supplying you with a reasonable way to work around the problem that is not materially detrimental to you and/or (b) re-performing any relevant Service(s). Square Support will attempt to fix any such problems without any additional charge to you. If Square Support is able to do so within a reasonable time, this will be your sole and exclusive remedy in relation to any breach and no Square Company will have any obligation or liability in relation to such breach.</p>

Square International will provide the SaaS Services (as defined in the SaaS Terms) to you in accordance with the SaaS Terms.

  <h3 id="arbitration"><strong>19. Arbitration</strong></h3>

  <p>Any Dispute between you and either or both of Square Europe and Square International (such Square party to a Dispute, the ‘Square Party’) arising out of or in connection with these General Terms or any Additional Terms or Policies, including in respect of their interpretation, subject-matter or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (‘LCIA’), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into these General Terms. The number of arbitrators will be one, unless the LCIA determines that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, a three-member tribunal is appropriate. The place and seat of arbitration will be London, England. The language to be used in the arbitration proceedings will be English. Any reference under this Section 18 will be deemed to be a reference to arbitration within the meaning of the Arbitration Act 1996. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Square Party will pay all the arbitration fees due to LCIA for any Dispute. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, the Square Party will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and any Square Party also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorised users or beneficiaries of the Services. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these General Terms, Policies, Additional Terms or related documents will prevent any party from commencing proceedings and pursuing claims before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 19 in cases in which interim, injunctive or declaratory relief is required or where the right to issue proceedings would be prejudiced by the impending expiration of any applicable limitation period.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 19, any Dispute, to the extent arising out or of connection with the Payment Services, may only be resolved in accordance with Section 39 of the Payment Terms.</p>

  <h3 id="governing-law"><strong>20. Governing Law</strong></h3>

  <p>These General Terms and any Dispute are governed by the law of England and Wales, without regard to choice of law or conflicts of law principles.</p>

  <p>Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions in Section 18, you irrevocably agree that the English courts in London, England will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Dispute, but Square International and Square Europe are each entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce their respective Intellectual Property Rights and/or Confidential Information.</p>

  <h3 id="limitation-on-time-to-initiate-a-dispute"><strong>21. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute</strong></h3>

  <p>Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</p>

  <h3 id="assignment"><strong>22. Assignment</strong></h3>

  <h3 id="third-party-services-and-links-to-other-web-sites"><strong>23. Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites</strong></h3>

  <p>You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by a Square Company (‘Third Party Services’). If you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services. Neither Square International nor Square Europe is responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services. The Services may contain links to third party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement or recommendation by any Square Company. Such third party websites are not governed by these General Terms. You access any such website at your own risk. Square International and Square Europe expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, Square’s Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to that website’s own terms, rules and policies.</p>

  <h3 id="other-provisions"><strong>24. Other Provisions</strong></h3>

  <p>These General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and Policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and Square and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.</p>

  <p>You and each Square Company agree that it shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this agreement. You and each Square Company agree that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in these General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and Policies. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under Applicable Law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under Applicable Law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These General Terms do not limit any rights that Square International or Square Europe may have under trade secret, copyright, patent or other laws. No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>

  <p>Except as provided by this Section 23, no express term of these General Terms or any term implied hereunder is enforceable pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the ‘Act’) by any person who is not a party hereto, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available, apart from pursuant to that Act. Any Square Entity may enforce any provision of these General Terms subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>

  <p>Nothing in these General Terms or in any document referred to herein or in any arrangement contemplated herein creates a partnership or joint venture.</p>

  <p>It is a condition of these General Terms that, in pre-contract negotiations and in the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations under these General Terms, each party hereto will at all times ensure its compliance with all Applicable Law relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 (‘Anti-bribery Laws’) and that no party hereto will commit (or procure the commission of) any breach of any Anti-bribery Laws or do anything that would cause any other party to commit an offence under any Anti-bribery Laws.</p>
