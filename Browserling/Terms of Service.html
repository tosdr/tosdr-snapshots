  <h2>11. Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>

  <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. It is our policy to respond to notices and counter-notices that properly conform with the DMCA's requirements. Accordingly, notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see the Copyright Office's web page at www.copyright.gov for details of the current DMCA requirements.</p>

  <p>If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Browserling infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by a user on one of our message boards), you (or your agent) may send us a written notification pursuant to the DMCA, by providing our DMCA Agent with the information listed below (and as further set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked:</p>

  <p>Identification in sufficient detail of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works on the Services are covered by a single notification, you may provide a representative list of such works on the Services, however, the representative list must still contain sufficient detail of the copyrighted works so that we can identify them;</p>

  <p>Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Services that contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the alleged infringing material(s), so that we can comply with your request to remove or deny access to it/them;</p>

  <p>Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);</p>

  <p>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;</p>

  <p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>

  <p>A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>

  <p>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice will not be valid. You must submit any notification of an alleged copyright infringement to Browserling's DMCA Agent by email at support@browserling.com.</p>

  <h2>12. Termination</h2>

  <p>Your right to access and use the Services, will remain effective until terminated in accordance with the Terms of Use. Browserling reserves the right to revoke the limited license granted to you herein for any reason or no reason, and, if we do, Browserling may terminate your access to and use of the Services, and may, in its sole discretion maintain or delete your Account.</p>

  <p>Browserling may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete your Account with or without notice to you, at any time for any reason or for no reason, including without limitation, for violation or suspected violation of the Terms of Use. For example, your Account may be deleted and terminated without warning if Browserling believes, in its sole discretion, that you are under 18 years of age; if you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete); or Browserling has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete. Upon termination, your right to access and use the Services or Customer Data, will immediately cease.

NO OPINION, ADVICE OR STATEMENT OF BROWSERLING OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, ADVERTISERS, SPONSORS, AGENTS, MEMBERS OR VISITORS, WHETHER MADE ON THE SERVICES, IN THE CUSTOMER DATA, ON THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHERWISE, SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY. <b>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND CUSTOMER DATA ARE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</b></p>

  <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>

YOU AGREE THAT THE DAMAGE EXCLUSIONS IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NO COMMUNICATION OF ANY KIND BETWEEN YOU AND BROWSERLING OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF BROWSERLING CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY HEREUNDER OR CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS OF USE. MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT INCREASE THE MONETARY DAMAGES LIMIT STATED HEREIN.</p>

  <p>The Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and Browserling relating to the Services or the Customer Data, and including the Services available on or through any Third Party Platform, that involve a claim of less than $5,000 must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. In addition, you and Browserling agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and Browserling that involve a claim of more than $5,000 are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in San Francisco, California.</p>

  <h2>18. Notices</h2>

  <p>All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be given by personal delivery, registered or certified mail, or Federal Express or other nationally recognized courier service which regularly tracks its packages, if to Browserling to its Registered Agent with the State of California, and if to you, to the e-mail and/or postal address associated with your Account. Notices, if personally delivered, shall be deemed to have been received on the date of delivery; if by registered or certified mail, on the third business day after mailing; if by Federal Express or e-mail, on the second business day after deposit with the service. You may not send any notices under this Section to Browserling via e-mail.</p>

  <h2>19. Miscellaneous</h2>

  <p>If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Terms of Use are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Browserling's prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. Browserling's performance of the Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Terms of Use is in derogation of Browserling's right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your access and/or use of the Services or the Customer Data and including the Services available on or through any Third Party Platform, or information provided to or gathered by Browserling with respect to such access and/or use. A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The parties agree that all correspondence relating to these Terms of Use, must be written in the English language.</p>
