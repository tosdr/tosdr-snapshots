You must not post any User Content on or through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. When you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to other third-party platforms, and/or adopt any third-party content.</p> <p>If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not post such sound recordings to the Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services.</p> <p>You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable and sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, perform, display, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, perform, display, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.

This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, etc.) (a “<strong>PRO</strong>”) or a collective management organization (e.g. JASARC, NextTone, etc.) （a “<strong>CMO</strong>”）, a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User Content.</p> <p><strong>Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists.</strong> If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO/CMO, then you must notify your PRO/CMO of the royalty-free license you grant through the Terms in your User Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO/CMO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in the Terms in your User Content or have such music publisher enter into the Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in the Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label.</p> <p><strong>Through-To-The-Audience Rights.</strong> All of the rights you grant in your User Content in the Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third-party services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content posted or used on such third-party service via the Services.</p> <p>Waiver of Rights to User Content. By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you post to or through the Services.</p> <p>We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy.</p> <p>We, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your content at our or their sole discretion. We have the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any posting you make on our Services if, in our opinion, your post does not comply with the content standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above. In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider violates the Terms, or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or third parties, without any liability to you. We may or may not notify you of such removal, disallowance, blocking or deletion. As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Content that you post to the Services on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content.

Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p> <p>Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Lemon8, you will first contact Lemon8 and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p> <p>Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Lemon8’s services and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Lemon8 or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Lemon8. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Lemon8 for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.</p> <p>You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Lemon8 are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p> <p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:</p> <p>Heliophilia Pte. Ltd., 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10, South Tower, Singapore 048583</p> <p>Email Address: <a href="mailto:contact@lemon8-app.com">contact@lemon8-app.com</a></p> <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA&#x27;s rules are available at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p> <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#x27;s rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p> <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.</p> <p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lemon8 and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@lemon8-app.com">contact@lemon8-app.com</a> within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services.</p> <p><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</p> <p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#x27;s individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Lemon8 each waive any right to a jury trial.</p> <p>If a counter-notice is received by Lemon8’s Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it. Unless the original complaining party files an action seeking a court order against the Content Provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Lemon8’s sole discretion.</p> <p>Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.</p> <p><strong>California Consumer Rights Notice.</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users of the Services receive the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at the contact information set forth at <a href="https://www.dca.ca.gov/about_us/contactus.shtml">https://www.dca.ca.gov/about_us/contactus.shtml</a>.</p> <p>Users of the Services who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of User Content they posted by contacting us at: <a href="https://www.lemon8-app.com/h5/feoffline/report/copyright-infringement">https://www.lemon8-app.com/h5/feoffline/report/copyright-infringement</a>.
