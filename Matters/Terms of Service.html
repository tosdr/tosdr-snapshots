<h3>Privacy Policy </h3>
</summary>
<p>Last updated: <i>18 July, 2020</i></p>
<p>This privacy policy (the <b><i>Privacy Policy</i></b>) was last updated on the date above and shall be updated from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised policy hereunder. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform all Users about how the Data Controller treats Personal Information and Non-personal Information. If any User does not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, then the Data Controller cannot provide the Services to such User, and such User should stop accessing the same.</p>
<p><b><u>1. DEFINITIONS</u></b></p>
<p>Capitalized terms shall be as defined in the terms and conditions unless otherwise herein defined:</p>
<p><b><i>Data Controller</i></b> mean Matters, Inc., the company responsible for the collection, holding, processing or use of Personal Information;</p>
<p><b><i>GDPR</i></b> is as defined in clause 9.2 of this Privacy Policy;</p>
<p><b><i>Personal Information</i></b> means information collected from the Users by the Data Controller or otherwise held by the Data Controller, relating to any personal information that can be used to identify such Users as individuals, including among others, names, contact details, email addresses, age, gender, passport or other identification document details, information or Third Party Coins ID or account details in third-party sites, including Facebook, WeChat, Weixin, Google, Weibo and Stripe, other registration, account, bank account information or profile information and any other such personal description provided during registration of the Account, and any information provided by or in relation to such Users pursuant to this Privacy Policy; and</p>
<p><b><i>Non-personal Information</i></b> means any such Personal Information which the Data Controller takes and makes it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating one User’s information with another User’s information), or by removing characteristics (such as User’s name) that make the information personally identifiable to such User (hence de-personalizing the information).</p>
<p><b><u>2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY THE DATA CONTROLLER</u></b></p>
<p>2.1 The Data Controller will request all its Users to voluntarily provide it with Personal Information for purposes set out in clause 4.2 of this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>2.2 In addition, when Users use certain features of the Services, the Data Controller may receive, store and process different types of information about such Users’ location, including specific information (e.g. GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services). If Users do not want their devices to provide the Data Controller with location-tracking information, they can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on their devices.</p>
<p><b><u>3. ACCURACY AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY THE DATA CONTROLLER</u></b></p>
<p>3.1 The Data Controller will receive, store and process Personal Information that the Users make available when assessing or using the Services. It will take appropriate steps to protect Personal Information collected and/or held by it against unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss, use or disclosure. </p>
<p>3.2 In order to protect the Personal Information, the Data Controller will require all Users (or their respective relevant persons as defined under applicable laws) to prove their identities in relation to their requests to access and/or correct their Personal Information. Requests for access and correction of Personal Information are to be addressed in writing and sent to &lt;ask@matters.town&gt;. A reasonable fee shall be charged to offset the Data Controller’s administrative and actual costs incurred in complying with the relevant data access requests. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that any Personal Information is inaccurate, the Data Controller shall take practicable steps to ensure that the Personal Information shall not be used unless and until those grounds cease to be applicable to such Personal Information or the Personal Information shall be erased. </p>
<p>3.3 Where any Personal Information held by the Data Controller is no longer required for the purposes as stated under clause 4.2 of this Privacy Policy, the Data Controller shall take practicable steps to cease processing such Personal Information as soon as reasonably practicable, provided that the Data Controller may keep copies of such Personal Information as is reasonably required (i) for archival purposes; (ii) for use in relation to any actual or potential dispute; (iii) for compliance with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) for enforcing any agreement the Data Controller has with such User; and (v) for protecting the Data Controller’s and its employees’ rights, property or safety. The Data Controller will take practicable steps to ensure such Personal Information will not be kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the above purposes (including direct or indirect purposes). </p>
<p>3.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Data Controller is entitled to retain, process and use, for indefinite term, any Non-personal Information.</p>

Such a third party may be located, and use of Users’ Personal Information may be made, outside of the United States in connection with such acquisition or reorganization.</p>
<p><b><u>6. EMAILS AND PROMOTIONS AND OPTING OUT</u></b></p>
<p>6.1 Only when Users have provided the consents required under applicable laws (including indicating that they would like to receive promotional materials from the Data Controller and providing their contact details to the Data Controller specifically and expressly in order to receive direct marketing communications), the Data Controller may use the Personal Information of such Users to contact such Users and provide information about goods and services (either alone or in conjunction with products or services offered by the Data Controller’s Affiliates or business partners) that may be of interest to such Users.</p>

<p><b><u>7. THIRD-PARTY SOCIAL MEDIA SITES’ PRIVACY POLICIES</u></b></p>
<p>7.1 Since the Services may collect information of Users from third-party social media sites, such as Facebook, WeChat, Weixin, Google and Weibo, and support products and features offered by such third-party social media sites, the privacy policies and practices and cookies policies (as applicable), as may be amended from time to time, of such third-party social media sites are incorporated to this Privacy Policy by reference (as applicable).</p>

This also applies when it has reasons to believe that disclosing the Personal Information is necessary to identify, investigate, protect, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with its Users or to others, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p>11.2 The Users understand and acknowledge that the Data Controller never ask the Users to share with other Users their Private Keys for their use of the Services. </p>

Although the Data Controller limits access to certain pages, the Users acknowledge that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, the Users understand and acknowledge that the Data Controller cannot control the actions of other Users with whom the Users may choose to share their User Contents. Therefore, the Users understand and acknowledge that the Data Controller cannot and do not guarantee that their User Contents will not be reviewed by unauthorized persons. </p>
<p>11.5 The website of the Data Controller and the Services may contain links to other websites or applications. The Users understand and acknowledge that the fact that the website of the Data Controller and the Services link to a website, application or advertisement does not mean that the Data Controller endorses or authorizes the collection of personal information from the Users of such third parties, nor does it constitutes a representation of any affiliation between the Data Controller and such third parties. The Users understand and acknowledge that, once the Users click on a link to third-party websites, applications or advertisements, they will access third-party websites, applications and advertisements which may collect information from such Users.
