We use two types of cookies on our Sites: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Sites. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.</li><li><b class="underline">Pixels (also known as web beacons).</b> This is a type of code that is embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our communications, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Sites with your social media account.</li><li><b class="underline">App Technologies.</b> Information concerning technologies included in our mobile applications and Sites that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our Sites may include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server.

The third-party ad network may collect information about your visits to our Sites and your interaction with our online ads. This is primarily accomplished using technology such as cookies, action tags, web beacons, and/or GIF tags which are placed in various places within our Sites and our online ads. Some browsers have a &#x27;do not track&#x27; feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
