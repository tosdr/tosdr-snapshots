		<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEB SITE OR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS, POLICIES AND GUIDELINES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEB SITE OR THE SERVICES.</p>

		<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS OF USE DO NOT APPLY TO CLIENTS USING THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL USE IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (“EEA”).</p>

		<p>These terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) apply to your access to, and use of, the web site of Trumba Corporation ("Trumba”), located at www.trumba.com (the “Site”) and to your use of the Services as defined below. These Terms of Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Trumba, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for products, services or otherwise. If you are using the Site or the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms of Use on such entity's behalf, and that such entity agrees to accept responsibility and indemnify Trumba for your use of the Site and the Services and any violations of these Terms of Use. If you are registering on behalf of your minor child, you agree to accept responsibility for your child’s use of the Site and the Services and his or her use of the Site. Please note that if you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you are prohibited from making use of the Services for personal, non-enterprise use.</p>

		<p>Trumba reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in the Terms of Use or any policy or guideline of the Site or the Services, at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes or modification will be effective immediately upon posting of the revisions on the Site. Your continued use of this Site or the Services following the posting of its changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Therefore, you should frequently review the Terms of Use and applicable policies from time to time to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Site or the Services. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Site and the Services.</p>

		<p>If you have any question regarding the use of the Site of the Services, please refer first to the Help Center or the Frequently Asked Questions. All other questions or comments about the Site or its contents should be directed to support@corp.trumba.com.</p>

	<h2>1.	Privacy Policy </h2>

		<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how Trumba collects, uses and discloses personal information about you.</p> 

		<p>If you use Trumba Services to process the personal information of end users in the EEA or to support your end users (“Enterprise Clients”) in the EEA, you understand and acknowledge that <strong>you</strong> are responsible for providing lawful notice of your own Privacy Policy or an equivalent notice of your privacy practices, in accordance with applicable law, as well as your terms of service on the client calendar, event promotion, and registration tools.</p>

	<h2>2.	Description of Services</h2>

		<p>Trumba provides and hosts for its clients (“Clients”) customizable web calendars (the “Client Calendars”), together with event promotion and registration tools (collectively, the “Client Services”). Client Calendars may generally be accessed either through the Site or through the Client’s web sites. For Clients in the EEA, Client Calendars may only be accessed through the Client’s web site. On behalf of Clients, Trumba also makes available to Clients’ end-users who access such Client Calendars (“End-Users”), online calendar, scheduling, reminder, event registration, event information and publishing, and email and text messaging services (the “End-User Services”). Together, the Client Services and the End-User Services shall be referred to as the “Services.” Clients are responsible for establishing and maintaining their own Client Calendar and event information and for the use of their Client Calendars by any person or entity, including their End Users. Trumba may impose limits on various calendar or other functions, as it may determine in its sole discretion. Trumba may choose, at its sole option and at any time upon notice to Client, not to have certain Client Calendars accessible through the Site. In such event, the Client Calendar shall only be accessible through the Client's web site and will not be searchable.</p>

		<p>Clients have the option of restricting access to Client Calendars through the use of the available privacy settings. If such settings are not utilized, calendars may be publicly accessible and viewed by anyone. You understand and acknowledge that if calendars are not designated as private, they could be accessed, indexed, archived, linked to and republished by others including without limitation search engines.</p>

		<p>End Users may also subscribe to Client Calendars or request event reminders, request or download event information, or request any other action regarding a Client Calendar (each an “Event Action”), in which case the End User’s email address and other personal information provided in connection with such Event Action may be provided to the publisher of such Client Calendar. Trumba shall not be responsible or liable for any third party including End Users, access to Client Calendars or for your or any third party’s use of any Client Calendars. Additional information regarding the Services may be found on the Site, including in the Help Center and FAQ sections of the Site. In the event of any conflict between the information contained on the Site and in these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use shall govern.</p>

		<p>Additionally, as part of the End User Services, Trumba may facilitate an End User’s payment of event registration fees (“Registration Fees”) on your behalf if you elect to purchase event registration services from Trumba (“Registration Payment Services”). You acknowledge that Trumba does not collect payments directly from End Users for such Registration Fees, and in connection with such Registration Payment Services, only directs End Users to our authorized third-party payment processors for such processors to collect and process the payment of Registration Fees directly from the End Users. Trumba has no obligation with respect to any billing dispute between you and any End User or arising out of or related to the event Registration Payment Services, Registration Fees or payment processing services, and Trumba shall not be responsible for issuing any refunds to any End Users under any circumstances. Without limiting the foregoing, Trumba may, in its discretion, provide features and functionality in the Services in order to assist Client account administrators in collecting and issuing refunds of Registration Fees from you to your End Users.</p>

	<h2>3.	Registration and Subscriptions  </h2>

		<p>The Client Services shall only be available upon your registration for a free trial or subscribing to the Client Services and paying in full the applicable subscription fees (the “Subscription Fees”). Absent any agreement to the contrary, the Subscription Fees shall be $99.95 per month, payable in advance. Fees for event Registration Payment Services (“Registration Payment Service Fees”) and other services are as set forth on the price list located at the Site and will be specified in each monthly invoice.</p>

		<p>Unless you arrange to be separately invoiced from Trumba and except for Registration Payment Service Fees, you must provide Trumba with a valid credit card for payment of the Subscription Fees and you hereby authorize Trumba to charge the Subscription Fees in advance each month to such credit card until you have cancelled your subscription. Once you have agreed to a plan, then Trumba is authorized to and will automatically charge your credit card for such Subscription Fees in accordance with such plan, unless you have made other payment arrangements.</p>

		<p>Regardless of how frequently you pay Subscription Fees, Registration Payment Service Fees will be invoiced by Trumba within thirty (30) days following the month in which such fees are assessed. All invoices for Registration Payment Service Fees must be paid by you within thirty (30) days of the date of the applicable invoice. You are solely responsible for paying any sales, use or other taxes (except for taxes based on Trumba’s income) for your use of the Services. In the event that the Subscription Fees or Registration Services Fees (collectively, “Fees”) are not paid on a timely basis, including due to an invalid credit card number, or you are otherwise in breach of this Agreement, Trumba may, in addition to any other available remedies, suspend or terminate your account as set forth in Section 4.</p>

		<p>Only one individual may access the Service at the same time using the same username and password. In order to register, you must be 18 years of age or older. If children between the ages of 13 and 18 wish to use the site, they must be registered by their parent or guardian. By registering, you represent and warrant that you are over 18 and that all information you provide in the registration form is complete and accurate. Trumba reserves the right to refuse service to anyone at any time, with or without cause in its sole discretion.</p>

		<p>In consideration of your use of the Site or the Services, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Site (“Registration Data”); (b) maintain the security of your password and identification; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Trumba, to keep it accurate, current and complete; and (d) immediately notify Trumba of any unauthorized use of your account or password or any other breach of security and accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information you provide to Trumba.</p>

	<h2>4.	Changes to Services; Termination  </h2>

		<p>Trumba reserves the right at any time, without notice and in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Services or to terminate or suspend your account and your license to use this Site, without any liability to you or any other person. You must agree to be bound by any modifications in order to continue using the Services. If you do not agree to the modifications, you must discontinue your use of the Services.</p>

		<p>If for any reason you are not satisfied with the Client Services during the first thirty (30) days after your initial payment of Subscription Fees, you may terminate the Client Services upon written notice prior to the end of such first thirty (30) days and receive a full refund of all Subscription Fees paid. You may terminate your account and your use of the Services at any time by canceling your account from the “Account Settings” page on the Site, sending us an email to support@corp.trumba.com, or mailing us at the address set forth at the end of these Terms of Use (attention: Termination). However, you acknowledge that it may take up to two (2) business days for such termination to be effective.</p>

		<p>Upon termination of your account for any reason, any information you have stored on the Site, including calendar entries and End User registrant information (including your own), may no longer be retrieved, so you should make a backup copy of any such information on a regular basis and before terminating your account. Trumba will not be responsible or liable for any loss of such information for any reason. For information about refunds of Subscription Fees in the event of termination please see the Billings and Account Questions portion of our Site. There are no refunds of any Subscription Fees or Registration Payment Services Fees in the event of any suspension or termination of the Services except as set forth therein.</p>

			<li>To the extent that any use of the Service or Interactive Areas includes the exchange and use, storage, and/or transmission of individually identifiable health information subject to state and/or federal law, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and any similar state law (collectively, with HIPAA and HITECH, the “HIPAA Rules”), the parties agree to comply with such laws and to execute and comply with the terms of a business associate agreement.</li>
			<li>
				Notwithstanding whether such exchange, use, storage, and/or transmission is otherwise permissible under the HIPAA Rules, Client agrees not to use the Service or Interactive Areas for the purpose of exchanging, using, storing, and/or transmitting the following categories of information considered Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as defined under the HIPAA Rules prior to entry into a business associate agreement with Trumba:
