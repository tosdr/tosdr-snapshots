All A2P messages originating from OpenPhone are subject to this Messaging Policy. Customer is responsible for any person to which it provides the ability to send messages through OpenPhone.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Consent/Opt-in Requirements</em>. Prior to sending the first message to each recipient, Customer must obtain consent from the recipient to communicate with them. Customer must make clear to the recipient that he/she is agreeing to receive the type of messages Customer plans to send. If Customer does not send the initial message to the recipient within a reasonable period after receiving consent, then Customer must reconfirm consent in the first message sent to that recipient. Consent is limited to the specific use or campaign to which the recipient has consented, and Customer may not send additional messages about other uses or campaigns unless Customer has received consent from the recipient for such additional messages. Customer must keep a record of each consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent. </em>If Customer intends to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, Customer must confirm the recipient’s consent by offering him/her a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). Customer must comply with the recipient’s preferences on frequency of contact.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Identifying Customer as the Sender. </em>Every message Customer sends must clearly identify as the sender the party that obtained the consent/opt-in from the recipient, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Opt-out Requirements. </em>The initial message Customer sends to a recipient must include the following language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END or QUIT. Customer must provide recipients with the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, Customer may deliver one final message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages are prohibited.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>OpenPhone Messaging. </strong>As part of the Service, Customer may receive communications through the Service, including messages that OpenPhone sends Customer (for example, via email or SMS). By signing up for the Service and providing OpenPhone with Customer’s wireless number, Customer confirms that Customer wants OpenPhone to send Customer information regarding Customer’s account or transactions with OpenPhone or that OpenPhone thinks may be of interest to Customer, which may include OpenPhone using automated dialing technology to text Customer at the wireless number Customer provided, and Customer agrees to receive communications from OpenPhone, and Customer represents and warrants that each person Customer registers for the Service or for whom Customer provides a wireless phone number has consented to receive communications from OpenPhone. Customer agrees to indemnify and hold OpenPhone harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to Customer’s breach of the foregoing.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Customer Data; Privacy Policy; Phone Number Retention</strong>.</p><ol start role="list"><li>For purposes of this Agreement, “Customer Data” shall mean any data, information or other material provided, uploaded, or submitted by Customer to the Service in the course of using the Service. Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data, including all intellectual property rights therein. Customer, not OpenPhone, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data. OpenPhone shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Service and the Customer Data. OpenPhone is not responsible to Customer for unauthorized access to Customer Data or the unauthorized use of the Service unless such access is due to OpenPhone’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Customer is responsible for the use of the Service by any person to whom Customer has given access to the Service, even if Customer did not authorize such use. Customer agrees and acknowledges that Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted ninety (90) days after this Agreement is terminated or Customer’s account is delinquent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer acknowledges and agrees that OpenPhone may (i) internally use and modify (but not disclose) Customer Data for the purposes of (A) providing the Service to Customer and (B) generating Aggregated Anonymous Data (as defined below), and (ii) freely use and make available Aggregated Anonymous Data for OpenPhone’s business purposes (including without limitation, for purposes of improving, testing, operating, promoting and marketing OpenPhone’s products and services). “Aggregated Anonymous Data” means data submitted to, collected by, or generated by OpenPhone in connection with Customer’s use of the Service, but only in aggregate, anonymized form which can in no way be linked specifically to Customer.</li><li>To the extent that Customer Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the <a href="/terms-of-service/u-s-privacy-law-addendum">US Privacy Law Addendum</a>, the <a href="/terms-of-service/u-s-privacy-law-addendum">US Privacy Law Addendum</a> shall apply and supplements these terms. </li><li>OpenPhone also collects information from individual users of the Services in accordance with OpenPhone’s current privacy policy, which is available at <a href="https://www.openphone.com/privacy">openphone.co/privacy</a> (the “Privacy Policy”) and which is incorporated herein by reference.</li><li>OpenPhone will retain each phone number under Customer’s account for no more than forty-five (45) days after this Agreement is terminated or Customer’s account is delinquent. If any user’s access to the Services is suspended or terminated under Customer’s account due to a violation of this Agreement, OpenPhone reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to release such user’s phone number (i.e., make it available for another user’s use) and delete all data associated with such user’s account and phone number (including without limitation call and message history and call recordings) after seven (7) days.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p><strong>Third Party Services</strong>.</p><ol start role="list"><li>Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Service may operate on, with or using application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or other services operated or provided by third parties (“Third Party Services”), including without limitation through integrations or connectors to such Third Party Services that are provided by OpenPhone. For example, the Services are dependent on Twilio Inc for messaging and third party stores from which Customer downloads OpenPhone’s mobile application, e.g., the App Store from Apple, Inc. or the Android app market from Google LLC (each, an “App Store”). OpenPhone is not responsible for the operation of any Third Party Services nor the availability or operation of the Service to the extent such availability and operation is dependent upon Third Party Services. Customer is solely responsible for procuring any and all rights necessary for it to access Third Party Services (including any Customer Data or other information relating thereto) and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof, including without limitation the Twilio Messaging Policy available at<a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/messaging-policy"> https://www.twilio.com/legal/messaging-policy</a> and Twilio’s Forbidden Messages Policy available at <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045004974-Forbidden-Message-Categories-for-SMS-and-MMS-in-the-US-and-Canada">https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045004974-Forbidden-Message-Categories-for-SMS-and-MMS-in-the-US-and-Canada</a>.  OpenPhone does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Services or any third party providers. Any exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and a third party provider is solely between Customer and such third party provider and is governed by such third party’s terms and conditions. To the extent the terms and conditions from an App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Agreement apply. Through OpenPhone’s mobile application, you may purchase (“In-App Purchase”) certain goods or features designed to enhance the performance of the Services. When you make an In-App Purchase, you are doing so through either the Apple iTunes service or the Google Play service and you are agreeing to their respective Terms and Conditions, available at and <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html">http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html</a>). OpenPhone is not a party to any In-App Purchase.</li><li>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including OpenPhone’s iOS applications (the “Application”) available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application: (i) both Customer and OpenPhone acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between Customer and OpenPhone only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content; (ii) the Application is licensed to Customer on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for Customer’s internal, personal use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services; (iii) Customer will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that Customer owns or controls; (iv) Customer acknowledges and agrees that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application; (v) in the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, Customer may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to Customer will be to refund to Customer the purchase price, if any, of the Application; (vi) Customer acknowledges and agrees that OpenPhone, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims Customer or any third party may have in relation to the Application; (vii) Customer acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or Customer’s possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, OpenPhone, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim; (viii) Customer represents and warrants that Customer is not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that Customer is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; (ix) both Customer and OpenPhone acknowledge and agree that, in Customer’s use of the Application, Customer will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and (x) both Customer and OpenPhone acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon Customer’s acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against Customer as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</li></ol><p><strong>Term; Termination</strong>.

OpenPhone has the sole right to decide whether Customer is in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued payment obligations, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

Each Indemnitor’s indemnification obligations hereunder shall be conditioned upon the Indemnitee providing the Indemnitor with: (i) prompt written notice of any claim (provided that a failure to provide such notice shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity obligations if the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure); (ii) the option to assume sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim (provided that the Indemnitee may participate in such defense and settlement at its own expense); and (iii) reasonable information and assistance in connection with such defense and settlement (at the Indemnitor’s expense). The foregoing obligations of OpenPhone do not apply with respect to the Service or any information, technology, materials or data (or any portions or components of the foregoing) to the extent (i) not created or provided by OpenPhone (including without limitation any Customer Data), (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance to Customer specifications, (iii) modified after delivery by OpenPhone, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials not provided by OpenPhone (where the alleged Losses arise from or relate to such combination), (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the Service is not strictly in accordance herewith.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California in English and in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures then in effect. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for preliminary injunctive relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator(s), provided that a permanent injunction and damages shall only be awarded by the arbitrator(s). In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. The prevailing party will be that party who may be fairly said by the arbitrator(s) to have prevailed on the major disputed issues. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Notices must be sent to the contacts for each party set forth on the Order Form. Either party may update its address set forth above by giving notice in accordance with this section. Except as otherwise provided herein, no modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless agreed by both parties in writing, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver and shall not limit such party’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. Except as expressly set forth in the Apple Application terms set forth in Section 9(b), Customer and OpenPhone agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under this Agreement.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Referral program</strong>.
