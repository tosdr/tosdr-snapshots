                                    applications, and in connection with the Services that we provide to Partners and
                                    Clients such as advertisers, agencies, marketers, and technology firms. Tapad
                                    observes signals generated from internet activity received from devices and uses
                                    various processing logic to establish likely connections and groups together unique
                                    Identifiers that are likely associated. The associated Identifiers may include
                                    pseudonymized identifiers that are associated with mobile applications on both
                                    smartphones and tablets, web browsers across various devices, and connected TVs or
                                    applications on connected TVs.</p>
                                <p>We collect information as users browse the internet, and we use common tools such as
                                    Cookies, SDKs and web server logs (more information is available below).</p>
                                <p>The signals that we use in our Services (creating likely connections between
                                    identifiers) are as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Unique Identifiers: These can come in multiple forms of pseudonymized
                                        identifiers like browser Cookies, Mobile Ad IDs which are associated with app
                                        usage such as IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android; other device IDs
                                        associated with devices connected to the internet, such as televisions or mobile
                                        game systems; or hashed emails or other authentication or probabilistic-based
                                        identifiers. These unique IDs allow Tapad to distinguish one browser or device
                                        from another.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Timestamps: Indicate the time the device was recognized.</li>
                                    <li>User Agent Strings: a string of information about the context of the user
                                        requesting content, typically including type of browser, device type, operating
                                        system, model or version number, and screen size.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>IP addresses: Internet Protocol address and generalized data that can be
                                        extrapolated from an IP address (e.g., we may be able to determine a general
                                        user location but not more defined than a postal code level).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Web address (aka URLs) or app IDs: web page or mobile application where a user
                                        is browsing.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>In a web browser, Tapad, our Clients and/or our Partners may include Data
                                        Collection Code such as pixels, JavaScript, or other HTML elements that sends
                                        data to our servers.

                                    <li>In mobile and connected TV applications, we, our Clients and/or Partners may
                                        include Data Collection Code such as SDKs, pixels, JavaScript, or other HTML
                                        elements that sends data to our servers.

                                    <li>The data sent to our servers by the Data Collection Code allows us to track the
                                        digital identifiers associated with a particular device as it accesses a website
                                        or application, and we use this data to create the Graph.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Our Data Collection Code may also collect data at the direction of our Clients
                                        in order to provide data processing Services. This Client data is controlled by
                                        our Clients and is not used by the Graph. Client data may include digital
                                        identifiers, information about the content you view and actions you take when
                                        you visit a website, and/or information about the ads you were served, viewed or

                                <p>We also use Google and Amazon cloud-based storage and processing systems. Google and
                                    Amazon are bound by our written instructions as to how to process Tapad data, do not
                                    read or modify any Tapad data, nor Client or Partner data, except as otherwise
                                    directed by us.</p>
                                <p>Tapad also receives matching IDs from Partners and Clients for the purpose of
                                    matching existing customers or otherwise known IDs to IDs in Tapad’s Graph. Matching
                                    IDs may represent device IDs, underlying Cookie IDs, customer IDs, or pseudonymous
                                    IDs outlined in this notice that are meaningful to the Partner or Client and are
                                    recognized only as another pseudonym in Tapad’s systems.</p>
                                <p>Tapad requires that Partners and Clients obscure and protect all Matching IDs before
                                    sending them to Tapad, such that the underlying data is either meaningless to Tapad
                                    or is encrypted such that Tapad has no ability to access the underlying data.
                                    Matching IDs may be used for the purpose of Tapad Graph management and for Tapad’s
                                    Services.</p>
                                <p>Some data in the Tapad Graph, including IP Address and User Agent string, is enriched
                                    with data provided by Partners. The enriched data is used for associating metadata
                                    such as country, city or postal code, the type of internet connection being used,
                                    and the general make and model of a device. Any location information provided by
                                    these partners is not more specific than a postal code.</p>

                                <h4>2. Offer Meaningful Choice</h4>
                                <p>If you would like to opt-out of Tapad Services, you may do so as described in this
                                    section.</p>
                                <p>Web browsers, mobile apps and connected TV apps operate with different Identifiers
                                    even though they may be on the same device. Because web browsers, mobile apps and
                                    connected TV apps have different Identifiers, you may need to opt-out of each
                                    separately.</p>
                                <p>When you opt out via one Identifier that is contained in the Tapad Graph, that
                                    Identifier will be opted out in perpetuity. If we have other device Identifiers
                                    associated with that ID in the Tapad Graph, we will automatically remove all other
                                    related Identifiers which Tapad deems to be associated to that ID from our products
                                    and services for sixty (60) days, at which point if the other Identifiers have not
                                    been opted out and seen again through Tapad systems, those Identifiers will follow
                                    our standard data ingress rules. If we have not probabilistically associated your
                                    other Identifiers in the Tapad Graph, then we cannot remove these other Identifiers
                                    as described here. </p>
                                <p>Therefore, to ensure thorough opt-out choices are honored, the opt-out process must
                                    be performed on each device and browser from which you choose to be opted out. For
                                    example, if you want to opt-out your computer browser as well as your mobile device
                                    browser, and we do not have the two as associated browsers, you will need to follow
                                    the guidance in this notice on both your computer browser as well as your mobile
                                    device browser and mobile device settings.</p>
                                <p>If you are interested in opting out on your computer or mobile web browser, please

                                <p>If you would like Tapad to stop collecting device data for the Tapad Graph and our
                                    associated Services, please click on our Opt-out link displayed on this page.</p>
                                <p>You may also opt-out from other companies’ data collection practices via the NAI’s
                                    opt-out page <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">here</a> or the

                                <p>We make the best effort to provide a persistent opt-out for all web-based
                                    environments.</p>
                                <p>PLEASE NOTE: In the web browser environment, do not just delete Cookies from your
                                    browser. The Tapad web browser opt-out works by replacing your unique Cookie ID with
                                    a generic opted-out value. Thus, if you attempt to opt-out by clearing Cookies, or
                                    deleting your devices’ content cache, Tapad will not be able to recognize your
                                    device as opted out, and if you subsequently visit one of Tapad’s website Partners,
                                    you may then create a new Tapad Cookie, which may then be included in the Tapad
                                    Graph.</p>
                                <p>The above opt-out will only be enabled if you are accessing it from a
                                    JavaScript-enabled browser and Third-Party Cookies are enabled. These two
                                    technologies are required for us to provide a persistent opt-out.</p>

                                <p>Tapad’s Services may include IP addresses as part of our probabilistic identifiers to
                                    extrapolate general user location, but not more defined than a postal code level.
                                    Your computer or other mobile devices connected to the internet via Wi‑Fi or mobile
                                    networks are assigned an IP address from a network internet provider. Your computer
                                    or other mobile device’s IP address may change over time, or as you change
                                    locations. Please note, public IPv4 addresses rotate between households on an
                                    infrequent basis depending on the internet service provider, and Tapad will opt-out
                                    the IP address registered for the twelve (12) months from when your request was

                                <p>We only collect data needed to provide our Services as described under the “Notice
                                    and Transparency” section of this Privacy Notice. Furthermore, we discard data that
                                    we may otherwise receive that is not used for providing our Services as
                                    described.</p>
                                <p>Tapad does not retain device-level data in the form that it is received from devices
                                    for any longer than necessary, at a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date Tapad
                                    receives the data. However, Tapad may receive device-level data from its Clients or
                                    Partners with longer look-back windows with respect to the date the data was
                                    collected, with a maximum lookback window of fourteen (14) months. For example, a
                                    device Identifier may have been received by Tapad on August 1, 2022 from a Tapad
                                    Partner, however, that device Identifier may have been collected by the Tapad
                                    Partner on September 1, 2021. Given our aforementioned look-back window of fourteen
                                    (14) months from the date the device-level data was collected, Tapad will not retain
                                    the device Identifier beyond November 1, 2022, which also aligns with our ninety
                                    (90) day retention from receipt of data. We retain device-level data we summarize
                                    and/or otherwise transform and aggregate from its original form for as long as
                                    necessary for our product-building, business, and archival purposes, but in no event
                                    longer than eighteen (18) months from the date the device-level data was collected.
                                    We also keep opt-out information for longer than this period so that we can continue
                                    to honor opt-out requests. </p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>We contractually require all of our Partners to do the same, and further, we require
                                    all Clients and Partners to only use the latest Tapad Graph build, which includes
                                    recent opt-outs. Aggregate reports by Clients or Partners generated from this
                                    information may also be kept longer.</p>
                                <p>We actively reevaluate our data retention policies on a regular basis to ensure that
                                    we only store data as needed to continue to deliver our product to our Clients.</p>
                                <h4>4. Protect Data</h4>
                                <p>Tapad takes significant steps to protect the security of the information that we
                                    collect. To that end, we have designed and deployed hardware, software and
                                    networking solutions in an effort to reasonably secure and protect access to our
                                    systems and data. Tapad’s Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) operates
                                    in accordance with and is certified to the requirements of ISO standard ISO/IEC
                                    27001:2013. Tapad has also completed the AICPA Service Organization Control (SOC) 2
                                    Type 2 audit for their Tapad Graph solution. The audit affirms that Tapad’s
                                    information security practices, policies, procedures, and operations meet the SOC 2
                                    standards for security, availability, and confidentiality.</p>
                                <p>However, no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective.
                                    Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Tapad Graph data or
                                    other information. In particular, we cannot guarantee that the Tapad Graph data or
                                    other information will not be disclosed, altered, or accessed in accidental
                                    circumstances or by unauthorized or unlawful acts of others.</p>
                                <h4>Legal and Other Disclosures</h4>
                                <p>We may share Personal Information when we believe such action is appropriate to
                                    comply with the law (e.g., legal process or a statutory authorization); to enforce
                                    or apply our customer agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for
                                    Services; to protect our rights or property, or to protect users of those Services
                                    from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such Services; or
                                    if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or
                                    serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or
                                    justifies disclosure of information without delay.</p>
                                <h4>Tapad Website Data</h4>
                                <p>In addition to the data we collect for the Services we provide, we also collect

                                            href="/">www.tapad.com</a>) with your consent. In this
                                    instance, in addition to collecting data for the purposes listed above, we may also
                                    collect user registration information from Tapad sites (<a
                                            href="/">www.tapad.com</a>), such as when you sign up
                                    for our email newsletter. Data would also be collected when a consultation or
                                    meeting is requested or when available marketing material is downloaded from our
                                    site.</p>
                                <p>This might include our business Clients’ or prospects’ names, email addresses,
                                    company information, title, countries, and phone numbers, and information on which
                                    Services they are interested in. We do not sell or rent data collected from our
                                    websites, but we may provide it to Third-Party service providers such as Customer
                                    Relationship Management (“CRM”) platforms as necessary to conduct our business
                                    operations. In addition to the data collected for our marketing purposes, we also
                                    receive and store Personal Information that would be covered under our Services from
                                    these website visits so that we can improve our Tapad Services and to analyze our
                                    own Client base.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, requesters will be asked to certify that any ID provided to Tapad
                                    originates from a device owned by the requester. Tapad will provide a certification
                                    form to complete at the time of the request.</p>

                                        is information that describes the precise geographic location of a device
                                        derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable
                                        specificity the actual physical location of a person or device, such as GPS
                                        level latitude-longitude coordinates or location-based Wi-Fi triangulation.
                                        Generally, the use of two or fewer decimal places in latitude-longitude data is
                                        equivalent to knowing the location to the area of a circle with a radius greater
                                        than 500 meters
