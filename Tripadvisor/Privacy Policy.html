<div class="item"><div class="item_name">3. Information Sharing</div><p>In order to provide some of our Services and processing activities, we use service providers and may need to make available each category of information that we collect to these service providers, and certain other third parties, including our group of companies, in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Our Group of Companies</u>. We may share information with certain companies in our corporate family so we can provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and others, which might interest you and to provide payment services. This sharing also allows us to better understand how you interact with the websites, apps and services of our group companies. <a href="https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/US-about-us">These companies</a> will comply with this Statement and all applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications.</li>
	<li><u>Suppliers</u>. We may share information with certain suppliers used to facilitate our Services, including where relevant to help with transactions.</li>
	<li><u>Business Partners</u>. We may share information about you, your Devices and your use of our Services with our trusted business partners. For example, we may share information so that we can facilitate payment for products or services you may purchase on the websites of our partners. This sharing is generally pursuant to written agreements which include confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations; please note, however, that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</li>
	<li><u>Social Media Websites</u>. When you use our Services and elect to share information with third-party social media websites, the information you share will be governed by the privacy policies of those social media websites and the privacy settings you have set with those social media websites.</li>
	<li><u>Advertising Networks</u>. We sometimes collect and share information about your interests with advertising networks and data aggregators. Some of these companies are members of the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> or the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more about the Digital Advertising Alliance, please <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/">click here</a>.</li>
	<li><u>Fraud Detection Companies</u>. Third parties may assist us by providing us with their fraud detection technologies.</li>
	<li><u>Trusted</u><u> third parties</u>. Third parties may also assist us in collecting information by, for example, operating features of our website or facilitating the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. We may share audience segments and other information, such as hashed email addresses, with third parties that use that information for tailored advertising to you. Other third parties may also provide us with their content and contract generation, management, and hosting tools. Third parties may only collect or access information as needed to perform their permitted functions. If and to the extent these third parties only assist us to perform our processing operations, we have bound them contractually to only act on our behalf as so-called data processors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain Device operating system versions permit you to opt out of certain types of information sharing, including to certain advertising networks. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time in order to turn off the functionality that collects and shares location information. Please check your Device settings if you want to limit such tracking. However, turning off location-sharing may affect certain features that we offer. If you have any questions about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.</p>

<p>We also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
	<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Tripadvisor, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>
	<li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain disclosures may be considered &ldquo;sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;shares&rdquo; under applicable U.S. state privacy laws. Details on how to exercise your legal rights with respect to such &ldquo;sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;shares&rdquo; can be found below in Section 13.</p>
</div>
<div class="item"><div class="item_name">4. Information Choices</div><p>You have options with respect to the processing and use of your information by us. You can access, update, and even close your account by visiting the &ldquo;Member Profile&rdquo; section on our website or app. In addition, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the way we communicate with you.</li>
	<li>Choose not to provide us with certain information, although it may be needed to take advantage of certain features offered on our websites.</li>
	<li>Prevent the collection of certain geolocation information (e.g. by switching off location services for our app in the settings of your phone), but note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our Services.</li>
	<li>Close your account directly from within your Member Profile. Note that if you close your account, we will deactivate your account and remove your profile information from active view. We may retain some information associated with your account (including past transactions) for internal purposes including backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, our own legitimate business interests, and legal compliance for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Statement.</li>
	<li>As a registered member, you can modify your marketing subscriptions, including email subscription choices, at any time, within your member settings.</li>
	<li>Unsubscribe from promotional messages, including emails with travel-related opportunities, in any such email we send.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="item"><div class="item_name">5. Information on Children</div><p>Our Services are not intended for children, which we consider to be: (i) individuals that are 13 years of age or under, or the age of privacy consent in your jurisdiction; or (ii) when processing data on the basis of a contract, the age of legal capacity to enter into the agreement.</p>

<p>We will only collect or process information belonging to children under very limited circumstances.

We will only collect personal information belonging to children if it is provided by and with consent of a parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have processed the personal information of a child without the valid consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete the personal information.</p>

<div class="item"><div class="item_name">9. Information from Cookies</div><p>We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient, and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance website security, and to show you relevant advertising.</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends the information from these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognize your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalized content. We also use other tracking technologies, such as pixel, SDKs, or server logs, that have a similar functionality. We also use cookies and tracking technologies to remember your login details, so you don&rsquo;t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services or to help us understand your preferences.</p>

<p>To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool which allows you to adjust and customize your cookie settings. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking the &ldquo;Cookie consent&rdquo; link at the bottom of every page and modify your preferences in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You have the right to withdraw your consent to cookies at any time by clicking on the &ldquo;Cookie consent&rdquo; link and modifying and saving your preferences. In the settings of your Internet browser, you can choose which cookies to accept and reject.</p>

<p>We allow third parties to collect and use information obtained during your browsing activities in order to deliver tailored advertisements to you (from us and from third parties across the Internet), to analyze activity and engagement on our website or app, and to provide you with enhanced Services. These parties are listed in our Cookie Consent tool, where we provide you with their details and links to their privacy notices. When we disclose your information to these third parties, this may be considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; under the applicable U.S. state privacy laws. Details on how to exercise your legal rights with respect to such &ldquo;sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;shares&rdquo; can be found below in Section 13.</p>

<p>When you enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up to a newsletter, or similar) or when you use our app, we may share personal data or other information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), mobile advertising identifier, IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our advertising partners, like LiveRamp and the Trade Desk and their group companies, acting as joint controllers. LiveRamp and the Trade Desk use this information to create an online identification code for the purpose of recognising you on your devices. The online identification code does not contain any of your identifiable personal data and will not be used by LiveRamp or the Trade Desk to re-identify you. We place the online identification code in our first-party cookie, a LiveRamp or the Trade Desk cookie, and allow it to be used for online and cross-channel advertising. It may be shared with our advertising partners and other third-party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. web, email, connected devices, and in-app, etc). These third parties may, in turn, use the online identification code to link to demographic or interest-based information that you have provided in your interactions with them. You can find detailed information on LiveRamp&rsquo;s data processing activities, including how to opt-out in their privacy&nbsp;<a href="https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/">here&nbsp;</a>and for the LiveRamp privacy policy with other available country links&nbsp;<a href="https://liveramp.com/privacy/service-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" title="Follow link">here</a>.

<p>Your rights with respect to your own personal information include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The right to request access to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
	<li>The right to request correction of your personal information if it is inaccurate. You may also supplement any incomplete personal information we have, taking into account the purposes of the processing.</li>
	<li>The right to request deletion of your personal information if:</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 40px;">
	<li>your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or processed them; or</li>
	<li>you withdraw your consent if the processing of your personal information is based on consent and no other legal ground exists; or</li>
	<li>you object to the processing of your personal information and we do not have an overriding legitimate ground for processing; or</li>
	<li>your personal information is unlawfully processed; or</li>
	<li>your personal information must be deleted for compliance with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The right to object to the processing of your personal information. We will comply with your request, unless we have a compelling overriding legitimate interest for processing or we need to continue processing your personal information to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.</li>
	<li>The right to restrict the processing of personal information, if:</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 40px;">
	<li>the accuracy of your personal information is contested by you, for the period in which we have to verify the accuracy of the personal information; or</li>
	<li>the processing is unlawful, and you oppose the deletion of your personal information and request restriction; or</li>
	<li>we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of processing, but your personal information is required by you for legal claims; or</li>
	<li>you have objected to the processing for the period in which we have to verify overriding legitimate grounds.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The right to data portability. You may request that we send this personal information to a third party, where feasible. You only have this right if it relates to personal information you have provided to us where the processing is based on consent or necessity for the performance of a contract between you and us, and the processing is conducted by automated means.</li>
	<li>You also have the right to lodge a complaint before your national data protection authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights described in this Statement). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.</p>

<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). &nbsp;To the extent you use a third party to submit a data request on your behalf, we may need to take reasonable steps to verify the authenticity of the request. These are security measures to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In an effort to speed up our response, we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request. You can exercise several of your rights through the personal information section of your account. To exercise your other rights you can file a request by <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/da774af3-e615-4e8c-8a28-3d13e98367c5/d294c536-2b05-4be5-b3dc-22f11e5c9d19.html">clicking here</a>.</p>
