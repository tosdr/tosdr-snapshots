The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.<br><br>We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:</p><ul><li>When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.</li><li>If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.</li></ul><hr /><h3 id='commissions'>Commissions</h3><p>The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.<br><br>Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.<br><br>We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.<br><br>We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.</p><hr /><h3 id='subscriptions'>Subscriptions</h3><p>The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription. <br><br>The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise. <br><br>A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.<br><br>When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.<br><br>Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.<br><br>Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/refund">Refund Policy</a> for further information.<br><br>By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.<br><br>None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.&nbsp;<br><br>Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.<br>&nbsp;<br>The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.<br>&nbsp;<br>The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.<br><br>If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.<br><br>We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.</p><hr /><h3 id='unsubscriptions'>Unsubscriptions</h3><p>The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.<br><br>Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.<br><br>If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our&nbsp; <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/refund">Refund Policy</a> for further information.<br><br>Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.</p><hr /><h3 id='cancellation-policy'>Cancellation Policy</h3><ol><li>Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.</li><li>If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.</li><li>While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.</li><li>When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.</li><li>When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.</li><li>If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.</li><li>Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.</li><li>If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.</li><li>If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><hr /><h3 id='fees-for-subscribers'>Fees for Subscribers</h3><p>There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.&nbsp;<br><br>You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.&nbsp;<br><br>As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star.
