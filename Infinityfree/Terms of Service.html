If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) this Site or the Services. In addition, InfinityFree may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications to this Agreement by email. It is therefore very important that you keep your &ldquo;Account&rdquo; information current.

If, after your electronic acceptance of this Agreement, InfinityFree finds that you do not have the legal authority to bind such corporate entity, you will be personally responsible for the obligations contained in this Agreement. InfinityFree shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from InfinityFreeâ€™s reliance on any instruction, notice, document or communication reasonably believed by InfinityFree to be genuine and originating from an authorized representative of your corporate entity.

<p>InfinityFree is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience.

You further acknowledge that InfinityFree reserves the right to modify these general practices and limits from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="script-usage-terms">Script Usage Terms</h3>
<p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a InfinityFree-hosted domain.</p>
<p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same server.</p>
<h3 id="disk-space-usage-terms">Disk Space Usage Terms</h3>
<p>InfinityFree offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Archives of movie files, audio files, zips, rars or any large volumes of files used for downloading/sharing is not allowed.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-free-hosting-accounts-per-person">Maximum Free Hosting Accounts per Person</h3>
<p>Three free hosting accounts are allowed per person. Registering more than three accounts is considered abuse and will result in all accounts being terminated without notice.</p>
<h2 id="7-your-use-of-infinityfree-content-and-user-content">7. YOUR USE OF INFINITYFREE CONTENT AND USER CONTENT</h2>
<p>In addition to the general rules above, the provisions in this Section apply specifically to your use of InfinityFree Content and User Content posted to InfinityFreeâ€™s corporate websites (i.e., those sites which InfinityFree directly controls or maintains).

<h2 id="9-monitoring-of-content-account-termination-policy">9. MONITORING OF CONTENT; ACCOUNT TERMINATION POLICY</h2>
<p>InfinityFree reserves the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a website/hosting service consumes excessive server resources or effects other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting server.

<h2 id="11-no-spam-liquidated-damages">11. NO SPAM; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h2>
<h3 id="no-spam">No Spam</h3>
<p>We do not tolerate the transmission of spam. We monitor all traffic to and from our web servers for indications of spamming. Customers suspected to be using our products and services for the purpose of sending spam are fully investigated. If we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications. This can include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email Messages</li>
<li>Newsgroup postings</li>
<li>Windows system messages</li>
<li>Pop-up messages (aka &ldquo;adware&rdquo; or &ldquo;spyware&rdquo; messages)</li>
<li>Instant messages (using AOL, MSN, Yahoo or other instant messenger programs)</li>
<li>Online chat room advertisements</li>
<li>Guestbook or Website Forum postings</li>
<li>Facsimile Solicitations</li>
<li>Text/SMS Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes described above. In order to use our products and services, you must not only abide by all applicable laws and regulations, but you must also abide by this no spam policy. Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have &ldquo;opted-in&rdquo; to receive messages. They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender&rsquo;s physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax. Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.</p>
<p>If we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any website hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services until customer responds. The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf. In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the domain name in question.</p>
<p>We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam. Suspected abuse can be reported by email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fece0e2ffe3e6eee1eceacfe6e1e9e6e1e6fbf6e9fdeaeaa1ece0e2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b4d7dbd9c4d8ddd5dad7d1f4dddad2dddaddc0cdd2c6d1d19ad7dbd9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
