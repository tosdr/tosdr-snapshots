<h1>Privacy policy (Datenschutz)</h1>
This is an English courtesy translation of our original text in the German language. Please consider that only the original version in German has legal value.
<br><br>
<b>General</b><br>
The protection of personal data is taken very seriously. All personal data is treated as strictly confidential and is treated according to privacy protection laws and this privacy policy.
<br><br>
This privacy policy explains the manner, the purpose and extent of processing personal data on our website and on associated websites, functions and content and if applicable on external websites.
<br><br>
We exclusively use your data for the execution of our service. All data is stored and processed according to the appropriate regulations.
<br><br>
We explicitly point out that all data transfers on the internet (e.g. communication via e-mail) are potentially vulnerable to security flaws. Total security against access by third parties is not possible.
<br><br>
Regarding the terminology used (e.g. "personal data" or its "processing") we refer to die definitions specified in article 4 of the GDPR.
<br><br>

<b>Controller</b><br>
The responsible data controller can be found in the <a href="https://www.9kw.eu/web/impressum.html" rel="nofollow">imprint</a> of this website. The controller is the natural or legal person which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses).
<br><br>
<b>Withdrawal of consent for data processing</b><br>
Several data processing operations are only possibly with your explicit consent. Withdrawing your consent is possible at any time. An informal message to us by e-mail, mail or our form is sufficient. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Right to information, rectification, restriction and erasure</b><br>
In accordance with current legal regulations you have the right to obtain information regarding personal data stored concerning you, their origin, recipient and the purpose of their processing at any time. Furthermore you have the right to rectification of your data, their restriction and their erasure. To exercise these rights sending an informal message by e-mail, mail or form suffices.
<br><br>

<b>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</b><br>
As the person concerned you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in case of a personal data breach. The appropriate supervisory authority for questions regarding privacy protection is the state data protection officer (Landesdatenschutzbeauftragte) of the state in which our company is located. 
<br><br>

<b>Erasure of data</b><br>
Data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed provided there is no legal retention period dictating otherwise. If personal data are not being deleted because they are required for other legally permitted applications their use is being restricted, i.e. your data won't be used for other purposes. This applies, for example, to personal data required to be stored because of trade or tax law.
<br><br>
Data will be stored for 6 years according to &#167; 257(1) HGB (books of account, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual financial statements, business letters, accounting records, etc.) or for 10 years according to &#167; 147(1) AO (accounts and records, inventories, opening balance sheets, situation reports, accounting records, trade or business letters, other documents relevant for taxation, etc.).
<br><br>

<b>SSL and TLS encryption</b><br>
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential information that you send to us as the operator of this website generally SSL or TLS encryption is used. Thereby data transmitted on our website can't be accessed by third parties. You can recognise an encrypted connection by "https://" in the address bar of your browser and by a lock symbol next to it.
<br><br>

<b>Server log files</b><br>
The web server and the website automatically store information automatically transmitted by your browser in the server log files. These are:<br>
- accessed page (URL)<br>
- type of browser and version used<br>
- operating system used<br>
- referrer URL (last visited page)<br>
- hostname of the accessing computer (IP address)<br>
- time of the server query<br>
No consolidation of these data with data from other sources occurs. The basis for the data processing is art. 6(1)(b) GDPR which allows processing of data necessary for the performance of a contract or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract.<br>
For privacy reasons this information is stored for a maximum of seven days and is deleted automatically subsequently. Data stored to be later used as evidence are exempt from deletion until the incident has been conclusively resolved.<br>
<br>

<b>Transmission of data when entering into a contract for the purpose of purchasing or shipping goods</b><br>
Personal data is only going to be transmitted to third parties if necessary for the performance of a contract. Examples for third parties would be payment service providers or logistics companies. No further transmission of data is taking place, except with your express consent. <br>
The basis for the data processing is art. 6(1)(b) GDPR which allows processing of data necessary for the performance of a contract or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract.<br>
<br>

<b>Registering:</b><br>
It is possible to create an account on our website to use certain functions. Data transmitted is only used for the purposes of using the specific feature or service. Required information is to be provided in full, otherwise your sign up request will be rejected.<br>
In case of important changes, for example for technical reasons, you will be informed by e-mail sent to the address you have given when signing up.<br>
Processing of the data you provided when signing up occurs on the basis of your consent (art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). It is possible to revoke your consent at any time, an informal message to us by e-mail suffices. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of data processing before the withdrawal.<br>
Data submitted when signing up is saved as long as you are registered with our website. Your data will be deleted if you cancel your registration. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.<br>
<br>

<b>Contact</b><br>
When using the contact form the data submitted (including your contact data) is saved to work on your request and to handle further questions. These data will not be transmitted without your consent.<br>
Data processing occurs on the basis of your consent (art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). It is possible to revoke your consent at any time, an informal message to us by e-mail suffices. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of data processing before the withdrawal.<br>
Data submitted using the contact form will be saved until you request deletion, withdraw consent or further retention is no longer necessary. Binding legal regulations (especially legal retention periods) are unaffected.<br>
<br>

<b>Online presences on social media</b><br>
Several online presences on social networks etc. are maintained to attend to and to inform active customers, users and interested persons.<br>
<br>

<b>Affiliate links</b><br>
Certain links on this website are so called affiliate links. When clicking on such a link the provider of the affiliate program or network is notified (possibly using a cookie) of the website of origin (publisher). When purchasing or interacting with the target website a commission is paid out to the operator of the website of origin. No further costs arise for the user and there is no further information about what you do on the target website. The commission has no influence on measured data to the provider and is handled automatically. If this is not desired you may contact the specific provider directly. <br>
<br>

We as the website provider have a legitimate interest in the saving of cookies to allow technologically error free and smooth operation of our services.
