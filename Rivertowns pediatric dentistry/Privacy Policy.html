Each time you receive a non-transactional email, you will be provided the choice to "opt-out" of future emails by following the instructions provided in the email.</p><p>Information you receive by email will be an unsecure transmission meaning it is possible that information could potentially be exposed while in transmission from our office email server to your email server.
