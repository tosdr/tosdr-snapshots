            on behalf of SP+. SP+ values your interest in its services and appreciates your visit to its Sites.

                    All trademarks, servicemarks, logos, model and brand names, emblems and protectable trade dress elements
            (collectively, "Marks"), whether explicitly marked or not, used on the Sites are owned by SP+, its

                <p>
                    Nothing contained in this Site shall be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any

            party.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any use of the Content or Marks provided on the Sites that does not comport with the above Terms shall be an

                </p>

                <h3>Online Parking Payment Service</h3>

                <p>
                    Certain Sites contain features (the "Online Payment Service") that permit you to pay for your parking
            privileges at certain parking facilities operated by SP+ as required under any applicable parking contract
            between you and SP+, including these Terms (your "Parking Contract"). By registering a user name, a password
            and an account, or by using the Online Payment Service, you represent that you are the SP+ customer of
            record, or have legal authority to act on that person’s or business' behalf, for the account you enrolled on
            the Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the authorization you provide through the Site or through the Online Payment Service ("Authorization"),
            your credit card will be charged or the bank account you have designated will be debited (either via one of
            the debit card networks by using your debit card or via the Automated Clearing House electronic payment
            system). You may schedule either one-time or recurring monthly payments for monthly parking plans, in
            addition to one-time payments for on-demand parking services. Pursuant to the Authorization, your credit
            card will be charged or your bank account will be debited to make payment to SP+. Each time you use the
            Online Payment Service you agree that SP+ is authorized to process your payment and facilitate the charging
            of your credit card or debiting your bank account for the amount of your parking fee and any other
            applicable fees that you have agreed to pay. You agree not to make a payment that exceeds your limits on
            your payment card account, transfer limits, or the balance of your bank account. Your agreement with your
            payment card issuer or financial institution where you have your bank account governs the use of your
            payment card or bank account, as applicable, and you must refer to that agreement to ascertain your rights
            and liabilities as a cardholder or account holder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If SP+ is unable to debit or charge the specified bank account or credit card for any reason, you shall
            immediately pay your parking bill using another payment method. If any debit or charge is returned unpaid by
            your financial institution or payment card issuer, SP+ may charge, and you agree to pay, a returned payment
            fee permitted under applicable law. Notwithstanding that you have subscribed to use the Online Payment
            Service, you continue to be responsible under your Parking Contract to pay all amounts due on or before the
            date they are due, and SP+ may terminate your account and/or seek all remedies available to it under the
            Parking Contract or applicable law if you fail to pay such amounts when due for any reason. It is your sole
            responsibility to pay your account on time to avoid late fees, collection activities, or suspension of
            parking privileges. If, in good faith, you dispute any fees, collection activities or suspension of parking
            privileges, you must provide us written notice of the dispute within thirty (30) days of such action. SP+ is
            not liable for your failure to pay your account on time for any reason including, without limitation, due to
            interruption or unavailability of the Sites or the Online Payment Service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You represent and warrant to SP+ that you are the owner or the authorized agent for the owner of the bank
            account or credit/debit card used in each Authorization and that debits and charges made in accordance with
            these Terms will not be disputed. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entering valid bank
            account or credit/debit card information as your payment source. If you have scheduled recurring payments
            for a monthly parking plan and (i) your payment source changes for any reason or (ii) you desire to change
            or delete the bank account or credit/debit card information used as your payment source or (iii) you desire
            to stop recurring payments, you must promptly notify SP+ of those changes by either using the applicable
            edit functions available in the Online Payment Service or contacting SP+ at&nbsp;<a
                href="mailto:customercare@spplus.com">customercare@spplus.com</a>. Payments initiated under the Online
            Payment Service will continue to be processed against your payment source until that information is changed
            as provided herein.
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    If applicable, you agree to honor and abide by the terms and conditions of any parking facilities or
            transportation vehicles that you access as a result of any purchases made through any of our Sites.
                </p>

                    SP+ controls its Sites (excluding linked sites) from its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, United States of
            America and makes no representation that any content contained in the Sites is appropriate or available for

                    By accessing this Site you agree that the statutes and laws of the State of Illinois, notwithstanding any
            principles of conflicts of law, will apply to all matters relating to use of this Site, or any dispute

                <p>
                    If any part of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and
            will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Regardless of any statute or
            law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of this Site or these
            Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The
            section titles herein are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,
            enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability
            of these Terms to arbitrate, shall be determined by binding arbitration in the State of Illinois, in the
            county of Cook. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules"),
            and will be administered by the AAA. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional
            remedies in aid of arbitration. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only
            on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim
            proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
                </p>

                <p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.</p>

                <p>
                    All commercial claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by Illinois law,
            excluding Illinois' conflict of laws rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a commercial claim between you and us is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must be
            resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois or a state court
            located in Cook County, Illinois and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts
            for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By using this Site, you further agree that you will not use this Site or any materials available thereon for

                    When applicable, you further agree, as a condition of using this Site, to ensure that all of your agents,
