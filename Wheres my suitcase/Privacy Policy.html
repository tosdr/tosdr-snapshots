                <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #377FBD;">Last revised as of June 29, 2020</p>

                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy only applies to use of, transactions made, Personal Information
            and data gathered on websites and mobile apps that are owned and/or operated by, or
            by authorized third parties on behalf of, SP Plus Corporation (each a
            "<strong>Site</strong>", and collectively the "<strong>Sites</strong>"), or by any
            of the other means described in this Privacy Policy. If you have arrived at this
            Privacy Policy by "clicking" on an authorized link from a Site, then this Privacy
            Policy applies to such Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website owned and/or operated by or on
            behalf of any third party even if we provide a link to such website on one of our
            Sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we refer to "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or
            "<strong>our</strong>," we mean SP Plus Corporation, a Delaware corporation, or the
            specific division, subsidiary, or affiliate that operates the Site, provides its
            content, or processes information received through it, each as appropriate and
            applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we refer to "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>," we mean the
            person accessing the Site. If the person accessing the Site acts on behalf of, or
            for the purposes of, another person, including a business or other organization,
            "you" or "your" also means that other person, including a business organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect Personal
            Information, what information we collect, how we use it, the steps we take to
            safeguard it, and the choices you have regarding how it may be used and disclosed.
            Please note that we do not necessarily collect all of the Personal Information
            described in this Privacy Policy for all users or engage in all of the means of
            collecting or using Personal Information we describe. No description of any type of
            information, means of collecting Personal Information, or use of information will
            require us to collect any particular Personal Information, make any particular use
            of any Personal Information, or offer any particular functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact
            between us and you. This Privacy Policy does not cover information we collect by
            means other than the Sites. If you have any questions about how we use information
            collected by means other than the Sites, you should inquire at or before the time
            you give such information to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time.
            Each time you visit the Sites or provide us with Personal Information, you are
            accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this Privacy Policy contains several important exceptions. Please read the
            entire Privacy Policy to be sure that you understand these exceptions.
                </p>
                <h3>Information Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    We, or the entity on whose behalf we operate a Site, own the information collected
            through the Sites.
                </p>
                <h3>Information We Collect From You</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to operate the Sites and provide you with information, products and services
            that may be requested by or of interest to you, we may collect and retain
            "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" which means information that could be used
            to contact you such as full name, postal address, phone number, email address, and
            license plate number(s), information you provide to pay for our services such as
            your credit and debit card numbers, bank or financial institution account numbers,
            billing address, purchase history information about the services your purchase when
            using the Sites, the services that you use or purchase on the Sites such as the type
            of parking permit you purchase, the location of the facility, the type of your
            vehicle, and your destination or venue if provided.
                </p>
                <h3>Your IP Address</h3>
                <p>
                    Each time you visit the Site(s), we automatically collect your internet protocol (IP)
            address and the web page from which you came. We use your IP address to administer
            and optimize the Sites for you and diagnose problems with the Sites. We may also
            supplement your IP address with anonymous Site traffic information that's collected
            automatically when you visit the Site(s), plus with information acquired from our
            joint marketing partners, from third parties, and from our affiliated companies.
                </p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    We may use "cookies" in connection with operation of the Sites. A cookie is a piece
            of data stored on the computer that runs an Internet browser and is commonly used to
            store information about a consumer's online activities, including information such
            as the content or advertisements that a consumer views or the pages a consumer
            visits within a particular website. It can contain information about you, your
            computer, your browser, your session, the websites you visit, and other information
            about you or others who use, or have used, the computer or browser you use to access
            the Internet. Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes: the stored information
            can be retrieved by our website server when you return to the Site(s). This allows
            us to personalize or regulate the use of the Sites, and also permits us to automate
            the access and data-entry functions of the Sites (e.g., login information), to store
            online ordering information for purchases you may make while visiting the Site(s),
            and to tailor the appearance or presentation of the Site(s) to your preferences or
            interests. The cookies we use, if any, are not linked to any Personal Information
            while using the Sites unless: (i) you have given us permission to link such Personal
            Information to one or more cookies or (ii) you login or register with the Site. You
            give us that permission any time you register on the Sites or place an order through
            the Sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how the Sites
            are used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Sites. For example, we may
            use cookies to personalize your experience at the Site(s) or recall your specific
            information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to
            the Site(s)). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services
            and targeted advertising. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. Most or
            all browsers permit you to disable or reject cookies. You can do this by setting the
            preferences in the browser. Use the "help" feature of your browser to obtain more
            information about refusing cookies. If you set the browser you use to reject
            cookies, you may not be able to access the Sites, use the full functionality of the
            Sites, or it may take additional time to utilize such functionality. If you opt to
            reject cookies, you may need to sign in with us each time you visit the Site(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies that advertise on the Sites (and their agents), one or more of the
            organizations with which we do business, or to which we provide links from the
            Sites, might use their own cookies. We have no control over such organizations' uses
            of cookies and users should review the privacy policies of such organizations to
            determine the uses such organizations make of cookies. This Privacy Policy does not
            cover how these companies use their cookies.
                </p>
                <h3>Log Files</h3>
                <p>
                    We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for
            statistical analysis and Site improvement. When you access the Site(s), we or our
            hosting provider may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server.
            Log file information may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser type,
            internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time
            stamp, and number of clicks. We or our hosting provider use this information to
            analyze trends, administer sites, track users' movements in the aggregate, and
            gather demographic information for aggregate use. Our hosting provider and we may
            review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of
            content are popular and useful to users.
                </p>
                <h3>Information Other Websites Collect From You</h3>
                <p>
                    The Sites may contain links to other websites operated by other parties whose
            practices may be different than ours. When you click on these links and visit these
            other websites, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or
            these other websites' business practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not
            apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites
            may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that
            information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Sites. You
            should check the other websites' privacy notices since we have no control over
            information that is submitted to or collected by them. We encourage you to review
            their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their
            actions.
                </p>
                <h3>How We Use and Share Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    We use your Personal Information to help us perform transactions, to deliver the
            services you have requested, to contact you when necessary in connection with events
            for which you purchased a parking permit(s) on the Sites (including event
            confirmations, changes, cancellations, and updates in general), to provide you with
            account login credentials, and to send you information, offers and other promotional
            materials from us and selected third parties. We may additionally use your Personal
            Information to aggregate, perform analysis, determine consumer trends, data-mine or
            otherwise improve the services that we provide. We may also share anonymized,
            aggregated information derived from Personal Information with advertisers and other
            third parties.

                <p>

            process your order, check your qualifications, bill you for products and services,
            and enable you to participate in discount, automated billing, and similar programs.
            By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity that uses financial
            information on the Sites, you consent to our providing your Personal Information to
            our service providers and to such third parties as we determine necessary to process
            your transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes. These
            third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to
            process the transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the circumstances of our arrangements, we may share your Personal
            Information with applicable third parties to facilitate parking or support services
            related to your transaction.. Any of these third parties are authorized to use your
            Personal Information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third
            parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no
            control. When we provide Personal Information pertaining to a transaction, we may
            also provide payment information pertaining to that transaction, such as amount of
            money paid or types of payment methods used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you participate in a contest, promotion, or survey offered by us (whether online,
            over the phone, or by mail), we may use your Personal Information to manage your
            entry in such promotion, to notify you if you are a winner, or to fulfill
            promotional obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that by purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services, electing
            to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to participate in, or
            register for, contests, promotions, or other programs (such as discount or rewards
            programs), from third parties on the Sites, those third parties may use your
            Personal Information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
                </p>
                <h3>E-mails</h3>

            have placed one), provide customer service information, or answer your questions and
            requests. We may also occasionally send you e-mail updates, notifications, or other
            promotional information about our products and services or about the products and

            your e-mail address with our affiliated companies to enable them to send you emails
            directly regarding their products and services, sales and other promotions. We
            include information in each commercial email that allows you to stop receiving
            future communications.

            Consequently, your Personal Information may be shared with a third party and may be
            included among transferred assets if we, any or all of our subsidiaries or
            affiliates, or any of our or their assets is ever acquired by a third party. By
            continuing to use the Site(s), you consent to your Personal Information being
            transferred in any such transaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information for Legal and Other Purposes</h3>
                <p>
                    We may also disclose Personal Information that you have provided when we determine
            that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, required in connection with a
            legal proceeding, to cooperate with law enforcement, or to protect the interests or
            safety of our company or other visitors to the Sites or users of services or
            products provided by us. We may also disclose Personal Information that you have
            provided to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated
            legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.
                </p>
                <h3>Clickstream Data</h3>
                <p>
                    As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website
            you visit. This information, sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be
            collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of
            computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you
            linked to the Site(s). We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally
            identifiable information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on
            each page of the Site(s), how visitors navigate throughout the Site(s) and how we
            may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.
                </p>
                <h3>Supplementation of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    We may supplement the Personal Information we receive from you with other information
            we receive from third party sources or clearinghouses. Thus, Personal Information we
            obtain through the Sites may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with
            information obtained through sources other than the Sites, including both offline
            and online sources.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Security Precautions; Geographic Location of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    No website is 100% secure. You can usually tell whether encryption is being used by
            noting the "locked" or other status indicator on the browser you are using. If the
            browser you are using does not indicate that the session is secure (e.g. by
            displaying a lock, a key or similar icon), you should assume that the connection is
            not secure and that third parties will receive the information shared by you and us
            during that part of the session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Personal Information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks
            which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental
            jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these
            computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in
            your country or jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <h3>International Users</h3>
