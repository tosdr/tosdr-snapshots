					available to us, for example by using our Products, and that others provide to us (“Data”).
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Data gathered from your device.</i> Our Apps use the motion sensors in your mobile device, or 
					native apps like Apple Health and Google Fit to read fitness data such as steps, active time, 
					floors climbed.	
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Data provided by you.</i> You can fill your personal profile with data such as Gender, Weight, 
					Height, Step Length, Age that we will use to calculate statistics like distance traveled, and
					calories burned from the steps you take.
				</p>

					<i>Data shared.</i> When you create an account in our Apps you have the option to share some of 
					this data with other users that you select. So some of the data collected above will be sent to 
					our servers so that it can be shared with the users that you select.

						<i>Apple HealthKit.</i> We use Apple’s (Apple Inc., 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA; 
						“Apple”) HealthKit (for more information see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit">here</a>) 
						framework, which provides a central repository for health and fitness data on iPhone and Apple Watch 
						and – with the user’s explicit consent – lets Apps communicate with the HealthKit store to access

						duration, and heart rate. 
						New data attributes may be added to the HealthKit framework, which will be portrayed in the Product 
						and which you have to consent to. 
						You can always stop our Apps from accessing your data by changing the settings of your mobile device.
