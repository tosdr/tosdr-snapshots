				<h2>1. Scope of License</h2>
				<p>
					According to this EULA, Bits&amp;Coffee grants You a non-transferable license to use for personal 
					and non-commercial use the Licensed Applications and/or the Services on any Apple-branded device that You 
					own or control and in accordance with all applicable laws and Apple’s guidelines on the use of the apps 
					rendered available on its App Store, including the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions ("Apple’s Usage 
					Rules"), except that the Licensed Application may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with 
					Your account via Apple Family Sharing or volume purchasing. This license does not allow You to use the 
					Licensed Applications on any device that You do not own or control. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Please consider that the Licensed Applications and/or the Services are licensed, not sold, to You for use only 
					under the terms of this EULA, unless the same are accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case 
					the terms of that different license agreement will govern the relationship between You and the Application 
					Provider, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. You do not acquire any ownership 
					rights or licenses by using the Website and/or the Licensed Applications and/or the Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bits&amp;Coffee reserves all rights not expressly granted to You hereinafter or within the different 
					license agreement.
				</p>
				<p>You may not:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Distribute or make the Licensed Applications and/or the Services available over a network where it could be 
						used by multiple devices at the same time, except that such Licensed Application may be accessed and used by 
						other accounts associated with You via Apple Family Sharing;
					</li>
					<li>
						Rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Applications and/or the Services or use 
						them for any commercial purpose;
					</li>
					<li>
						Copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and Apple’s Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, 
						disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed 
						Applications and/or the Services, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any 
						foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing 
						terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Applications and/or Services). 
						Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Bits&amp;Coffee and its licensors, if any.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will 
					govern any upgrades provided by Bits&amp;Coffee that replace and/or supplement the Licensed Applications, 
					unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license shall prevail 
					over this EULA.
				</p>
