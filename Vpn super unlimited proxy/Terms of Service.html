		<p>Actual service coverage, speeds, locations and quality may vary. The Service will attempt to be available at all times except for limited periods for maintenance and repair. However the Service may be subject to unavailability for a variety of factors beyond our control including emergencies, third party service failures, transmission, equipment or network problems or limitations, interference, signal strength, and may be interrupted, refused, limited or curtailed. We are not responsible for data, messages or pages lost, not delivered, delayed or misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Service or communications services or networks (e.g., T-1 lines or the Internet). We may impose usage or Service limits, suspend Service, or block certain kinds of usage in our sole discretion to protect users or the Service. Network speed is an estimate and is no indication of the speed at which your or the Service sends or receives data.

		<p>We do not put any cap on bandwidth or data usage per user however the use of service is subjected to fair usage. Creating automated or manual VPN sessions in a manner that would impersonate a bot or exerting excessive load on the network that may disturb other users on the network or utilizing substantially excessive bandwidth that exceeds the average user bandwidth usage for an extended duration or the likes, all are considered as unfair usage of the network.

		<h5><b>MobileJump DMCA Policy</b></h5>

		<p>MobileJump is a service provider of transitory digital network communications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") 17 U.S.C. p. 512(a). Accordingly, it is MobileJump's policy to promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by MobileJump to be repeat infringers, where a repeat infringer is an end user of the MobileJump Services who has been notified by MobileJump of infringing transmissions activities more than twice ("Repeat Infringer Policy"). Because of the ephemeral nature of transmissions imitated at the direction of persons using the MobileJump Service, it is generally not possible for MobileJump to take-down content from its system, but it will use all reasonable efforts to identify the offending persons in order to enforce its Repeat Infringer Policy.</p>

		<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
