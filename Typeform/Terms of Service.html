We can change the price at any time—we have to give you notice first.\n\nIf you carry on using our service after changes come into effect, you automatically agree to the new price. What you then pay is not refundable, unless the law says it is. \n\nIf you don’t pay, we might suspend or delete your account—which means you could lose data. \n\n*Do prices include VAT?* \n\nNo, VAT, sales taxes and other applicable taxes are not included. We will calculate the applicable taxes and show them to you before paying. \n\n*Can I pay in gold doubloons?* \n\nNo. But you can pay with a credit or debit card. Payment must be made at the time of subscription to the plan or add-on.\n\nWe have no access to payment data, and we don’t store that information. Only the company processing payments has access to this—they’re certified as a PCI Service Provider Level 1. \n\nPlease make sure your payment information is up-to-date.

If you activate it, we will take care of making sure that everything is in order, and you will be charged for the plan to which you are moved to.\n\n*How do you invoice?* \n\nWe invoice every month or year—depending on how you decided to pay. We invoice in advance. We’ll send invoices to the email address you provided when you created your account. \n\nCan I get a refund if I cancel my subscription or delete my account? \n\nSorry, no.

Capitalized terms used in this PTC and not defined shall have the meanings given in the STC.\n\n*1. General* \n\nWe reserve at any time the right to require payment of Fees for certain or all Services. You shall pay all applicable Fees, as described on the Site, in connection with those of our Paid Subscription selected by you. We reserve the right to change the price and to institute new charges at any time upon notice to you (i.e. on the Site and\u002For by email). Additional payment terms may be provided to you at the time of purchase.\n\nBy continuing to use or access the Services after such changes come into effect, you agree to be bound by the new or increased charges.\n\nSubject to any applicable law, any Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.\n\nSubject to applicable legal requirements, failure to pay Fees may result in the suspension or termination of your Subscription, and may further result in a loss of your data associated with the use of the Services. \n\n*2. Taxes*\n\nThe prices for the Services exclude VAT, sales taxes and any other taxes, as applicable. VAT is the value added tax that must be applied to the Services sold within certain territories and it may apply to you or not depending on several circumstances. We will calculate the Fees and any applicable Taxes and show that information to you before checkout.\n\n*3. Payment*\n\nPayment of all Fees is to be made by credit or debit card, and any amounts due are payable upon purchase of Paid Subscription or add-on Paid Subscription (net 0). We may determine and modify the payment methods we accept from time to time in our sole discretion. Payments are processed by means of a third party, which is certified in accordance with PCI Level 1 requirements. Therefore, we have no access to payment information, nor subsequently store said piece of information. \n\nYou understand and agree that by providing such payment method you are authorizing us to use such method on a recurring basis to collect all Fees due. You further authorize us to use a third party to process payments and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party.\n\nYou must update the payment information provided to us from time to time, in order to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date. Should a payment not be processed because you fail to meet the obligations set forth in this section, your access to or use of the Services may be suspended or terminated, as described in more detail in section 6 of the Service Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you warrant and represent that you will only submit payment information that is valid, and that you are authorized to use.\n\nWhere your payment information change or are due to expire, we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number, expiry date, and CVV (or equivalent). This enables us to continue to provide you access to the Services. You authorize us to continue to charge your card using the updated information. In the event of a failed attempt to charge to your payment method (e.g. if your payment method has expired), we reserve the right to retry billing your payment method. If a payment is not successfully authorized because of expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, we may suspend or terminate your Paid Subscription. You will remain responsible for any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your Paid Subscription, including collection costs, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and court costs. You also agree that we may charge your payment method on file if you decide to restart your Paid Subscription.\n\n*4. Invoicing and reimbursements*\n\nPaid Subscriptions are invoiced in advance, with monthly or annual frequency, depending on the applicable Subscription Period. You expressly authorize us to issue electronic invoices for the Paid Subscription, which will be sent to the email address you provided when creating your Account. \n\nSubject to applicable law, Fees are nonrefundable. We will not refund any amount nor grant any credit for Subscriptions (including any add-ons you may have purchased from time to time) that are cancelled before reaching the end of the then current Subscription Period.\n\n*5. Automatically upgrading your Subscription*\n\nIf you purchased a Paid Subscription, you may opt to automatically upgrade to the next available plan in the event that you reach the response limits covered by the Paid Subscription you initially purchased. This feature is available on the 'Settings' menu and, if so activated, you will be expressly authorizing us to charge you for the difference between your then-current Paid Subscription and the Paid Subscription you are updating to, prorated to the remainder days of your Subscription Period. The Paid Subscription to which you have been upgraded to will be auto-renewing on a rolling basis, as further explained in the STC.\n\n*6.

'GDPR' shall be understood as (i) the Regulation (EU) 2016\u002F679, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; (ii) the GDPR as it forms part of UK law by virtue of section 3 of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (together, “UK Data Protection Laws”); (iii) any future laws that may amend them or complement them in the future.\n\nFor clarification purposes, under this DPA (i) the processing of data regulated hereunder shall take place for as long as there is a service agreement in place between you and we, or until you decide to terminate said agreement; (ii) the nature and purposes of the processing shall be the collection, saving, organization, hosting, and deletion of data, as well as making it available to you upon your request; and (iii) the types of personal data and the categories of data subjects that are likely to be used in our product are name, surname, email address, telephone number, other ID details belonging to employees, candidates, prospects, and clients. \n\n\n*1. Processing of data*\n\nWe will process any personal data we may have access to because of the provision of the Services in accordance with the documented instructions provided by you from time to time. Should a Union or Member State law to which we are subject requires us to process personal data —including the international transfer of personal data—, we will inform you of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\nShould we have reasonable grounds to believe that a documented instruction given by you infringes the GDPR or any other applicable EU data protection law or regulation, we will put said instruction on hold and immediately notify you. At your sole risk and without us being responsible or liable to you for any losses, you will be entitled to order us to perform any such instruction despite the concerns raised by us, as long as you reconfirm your instruction in writing. \n\nFor purposes of this DPA, it will be understood that a ‘documented instruction’ includes, without limitation, (i) any instruction delivered by you by means of any durable media, such as a letter or email; (ii) any instruction electronically sent by you when using the software provided as part of the Services (i.e. by using the interface part of the software and the features made available through it); or (iii) the provisions of the DPA.\n\nFor clarification purposes and given your position of data controller, you warrant and represent that you will timely and sufficiently perform your obligations under the applicable privacy laws, such as inform data subjects (e. g. respondents to the forms, etc.) and obtain their consent (where appropriate). This enumeration is for illustration purposes only, in the sense that you will still be required to satisfy the obligations you are subject under the GDPR, such as making sure, in general, that the processing satisfies the requirements of the GDPR, you have the right and obligation to decide about the purpose and means of said processing, or making sure that there is a legal basis for the processing.\n\n*2. Confidentiality duty*\n\nWe will ensure that all employees authorized to process personal data have committed to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.\n\n*3. Sub-processors *\n\nYou will subscribe to the emailing list available at [https:\u002F\u002Fhelp.typeform.com\u002Fhc\u002Fen-us\u002Farticles\u002F360029617191-What-other-companies-do-we-share-data-with-](https:\u002F\u002Fhelp.typeform.com\u002Fhc\u002Fen-us\u002Farticles\u002F360029617191-What-other-companies-do-we-share-data-with-) in order to receive notifications for changes in the sub-processor list pursuant to this Section. Said page includes a current list of approved subprocessors for purposes of this Section.\n\nIn the event that we intend to replace one subprocessor by other or contract new subprocessors to provide you with the Services, you will be entitled to reasonably oppose (i.e. any challenge based on the potential or actual failure to meet the legal requirements set forth by the GDPR by the subprocessor to be appointed) to such change in the non-extendable term of fifteen (15) calendar days and, if you exercise such right, we will be entitled to early terminate the contractual relationship set forth in for the provision of the Services. \n\nWe will enter into written agreements with any sub-processors engaged in the provision of the Services including the safeguards and guarantees required by the GDPR, particularly in respect of implementing the security measures required in the GDPR, and we will be liable for any actions by our sub-processors.\n\n*4. Data subjects’ rights *\n\nTaking into account the nature of the processing, we will assist you by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of your obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR, if applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, we will send to you any request data subjects may address directly to us together with all relevant information, if any, so that you can formally contact and answer to data subjects.\n\n*5. Security measures *\n\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as those measures are further detailed in Annex II. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to us, we will reasonably assist you in compliance with the security obligations set forth by Article 32 of the GDPR. \n\n*6. Assistance and data breaches*\n\nIn addition to the duty set forth in Section 5 above, we will also provide, subject to the nature of processing and information available to us, assistance in complying with obligations set forth in Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, if applicable.\n\nWith respect to data breaches, we will notify you without undue delay upon we becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting personal data and, in any event, within the deadlines set forth under the GDPR. We will provide you with sufficient information to allow it to meet any obligations to report or inform competent authorities or data subjects. We will reasonably cooperate with you and take such reasonable commercial steps as are directed by you to assist in the investigation, mitigation and remediation of each such data breach. For the avoidance of doubt, you will be the only Party responsible for both filing any reports required under applicable law and notifying data subjects, and you will defend, indemnify and hold us harmless of any and all costs (including attorney’s fines), fines or sanctions, or any damages that lack of action on your side may cause.\n\n*7. Termination *\n\nYou will decide whether you want us to delete or return personal data, unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data. To this end, you acknowledge that deletion of the account provided as part of the Services will always result in deletion of personal data, and its request to delete the account will be understood as a request to delete data under this Section 7.\n\nCanceling your paid subscription shall not result in a termination of the Services and, therefore, a termination of this DPA. You will still be able to keep using our Services under a free plan, but some of the functionalities offered to you may not be fully available. This includes the ability to access and download pre-collected responses - for clarification purposes, you will still be able to ask us to download and send you a copy of these responses and we will perform this action as soon as possible and, in any event, within fifteen (15) days.\n\nIf you are an inactive free user, as this term is described in the STC, you accept that data is deleted after the 24-month period of time set forth in these STC.\n\n*8. Audit rights*\n\nWe will make available to you the information necessary to demonstrate our compliance with the obligations set forth in this DPA. You agree that the obligation to provide information demonstrating compliance with this DPA may be satisfied by us making available to you copies of the audit reports and\u002For certifications undergone by us, such as ISO27001 or SOC2 certificates. In the event that these documents do not reasonably address your concerns, you agree that you may only conduct up to one (1) audit per year, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that we are not performing the obligations laid down in this DPA. Audits will only be carried out during normal business hours, and you will bear all costs unless we are found to be in a material breach of this DPA.\n\n*9. International transfer of personal data*\n\nIn the event that the you are neither subject to the GDPR, nor located in the EEA, nor the transfer can be legally performed in accordance with the GDPR (because such transfer falls under an adequacy decision passed by the European Commission or can be otherwise performed under the GDPR on the basis of BCR, a certification mechanism or under a legally binding instrument), you and us enter into the SCCs, module 4, as a mechanism to ensure the adequate protection of personal data being transferred outside the EEA. \n\nShould you be based in the United Kingdom, the Parties declare that the transfer of data from the United Kingdom to Spain or from Spain to the United Kingdom will not be construed as an international transfer of personal data, considering the adequacy decisions passed on this subject. Annex IV shall apply in respect of any onward transfers.\n\nYou authorize to the transfer of data to the sub-processors listed in Section 3 above, it being understood that any such transfer will be performed to the extent that we enter into a written contract with the sub-processors setting forth the obligations to be implemented by the sub-processors in respect of the transfer of data (e.g. SCCs, module 3; or, should you be an entity subject to the UK GDPR, the SCCs amended as specified in Annex IV), and you have the right to oppose any future changes or amendments of the sub-processors by following the same steps mentioned in Section 3 above. Should you exercise any such right, we will be entitled to early terminate the contractual relationship set forth for the provision of the Services. For purposes of the SCCs:\n\n-\tClause 7 (Docking Clause) will not apply;\n-\tOption 2 in Clause 9 (general written authorization) is chosen.
