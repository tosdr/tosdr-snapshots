								<h3>4. Who we share your personal information with and why</h3>
								<p class="paragraph">There are situations in which we need to provide your personal information to other parties involved in the provision of our services, which could be data transfers within the ING Group and to third parties. The ING Group and third party entities who we may share your personal information with may be located overseas. As ING Group operates in over 40 countries, it is likely that your personal information will be disclosed to overseas recipients. Where your CDR data includes personal information, we may disclose that personal information to an accredited data recipient. </p>

                                <p><strong>Within the ING Group</strong></p>

								<p class="paragraph">IBAL is part of the ING Group which provides financial and insurance or brokerage services in over 40 countries. The countries to which your personal information is likely to be disclosed includes The Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Singapore, and Slovakia.  </p>

The ING Group is committed to your privacy and it has adopted strong principles in that respect through its GDPP. The GDPP is approved by the Dutch Data Protection Authority which is the lead supervisory authority for ING Bank N.V. (our parent company) and is binding on all ING entities, subsidiaries, branches, representative offices, and affiliates worldwide (also known as  "<strong>Binding Corporate Rules</strong>") </p>
                                <p class="paragraph">IBAL may share your personal information with ING Bank N.V. to ensure that the ING Group will be able to comply with its legal obligations and/or for reasons of substantial public interests:  </p>

										<p>	to comply with any regulatory and statutory reports and data requests as required by ING Group’s European regulators like, among others, European Banking Authority (EBA), European Central Bank (ECB) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). When possible, personal information will be aggregated meaning that only information about groups of clients will be shared with the Group’s regulators to ensure that it can no longer be linked back to you.</p>
										<p>for the development (also on behalf of IBAL) of ING’s internal credit models. Under EU banking rules, ING Group is obliged to develop these credit models to be able to calculate any counterparty risks and exposures which allows ING Group to determine our risks as well as the extent of the financial buffer we must hold, when providing financial services to you.

										</p>
										<p>	for the development (also on behalf of IBAL) of ING’s Know Your Customer (KYC) models. To safeguard the ING Group against involvement in Financial Economic Crimes, KYC models are being developed on a group level for client and transaction screening to detect (potential) criminal activities. These KYC models incorporate mandatory requirements derived from, among others, the EU Directives and Regulations in the area of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Guidelines (BCBS) and EU, US and UN sanctions laws and regulations.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph">We create a profile of you when you apply for a loan or credit in order to assess if you can meet your financial obligations towards us and to ensure that we do not offer loans that are not suitable for you. We assess the risk connected to a contract with you via a method called credit-scoring. Your credit score is calculated based on automated decision-making. You have to achieve a pre-defined minimum-score to ensure an acceptable risk for us.  </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Based upon the personal information provided by you, we consult external service providers and credit rating agencies to acquire relevant financial information (credit-rating, financial statements, turn-over/solvency, and payment history). If you already have, or had, a relationship with us in the past, we combine the aforementioned (external) financial information with internal payment history and transaction data related to you. In case you do not achieve the minimum-score, the automated credit-scoring will result in a decline. In that case, we will refrain from entering into an agreement with you since we deem the risks for you and us too high.</p>

								<h3>7. Your rights and how we respect them</h3>	

								
								<p class="paragraph">If your personal information is processed, you have privacy rights. Based on applicable laws, your privacy rights may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If you have questions about which rights apply to you, please get in touch with us through the email address mentioned in item 9.  </p>
								<p class="paragraph">You have the following rights:</p>

								<p><strong>Right of access </strong></p>
								<p class="paragraph">You have the right to ask us for access to your personal information or the information that we hold about you. To do so, please provide your request in writing to the IBAL Privacy Officer at GPO Box 4094, Sydney NSW 2001 or customer.advocate@ing.com.au. Please specify the information you wish to access, to help us quickly identify and retrieve that information for you.</p>
								<p class="paragraph">Please note that requests for access to your personal information may only be made by you or by another person who you have authorised to make a request on your behalf, such as a legal guardian or authorised agent. We will require you to verify your identity, or the identity and authority of your representative, to our reasonable satisfaction.
										</p>

										
							
										<p class="paragraph">We may impose a reasonable charge for providing access to this information to recover any expenses incurred in retrieving and collating the requested information. Where an access charge applies, unless you authorise us to debit your account with us, access won't be provided until we receive payment. We will respond to your access request as soon as possible and tell you how long it will take to provide the information. This may be up to 30 days in some circumstances.
											
												</p>



											
										<p class="paragraph">
											We may exercise our right to deny access to particular information in certain situations, for example, where access may reveal our commercially sensitive decision processes (e.g. criteria for loan approvals), where the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, or where it will threaten the privacy of other individuals.
												</p>
											
										<p class="paragraph">If we deny you access to your personal information, we will write to you to:</p>
										<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
												<p>explain the reason your access request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so in the circumstances; and</p>
												<p>the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.</p>
												</div>
												
										<p class="paragraph">If we refuse to give you access, if appropriate, we will attempt to find alternative means to enable you to access the information, for example, through a mutually agreed intermediary.</p>

										<p><strong>Right to rectification </strong></p>
											
										<p class="paragraph">For personal information that is not CDR data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading. For instance, we may ask you to confirm some of your details when you speak to our Contact Centre staff. However, please contact us if you learn that any of your personal information that we hold is incorrect, has changed or requires updating. You can update some of your personal information using online banking.</p>

				
										<p class="paragraph">It may take 30 days or more to consider your correction request in unusual circumstances (e.g., where we are required to consult with other credit reporting bodies and/or credit providers in relation to the information).</p>

	
										<p class="paragraph">We will promptly update your personal information if it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. If we correct the personal information the subject of your correction request and we have previously disclosed that information to a third party, we will notify that third party of the corrected information (if we're required to by law).</p>
											
										<p class="paragraph">If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, we will write to you to: explain the reason your correction request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so; and the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.
												</p>
											
										<p class="paragraph">If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, you also have the right to ask us to attach a statement that in your opinion the information is in your opinion inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. However, please note that this right does not apply to our refusal to correct your credit information.</p>






											
										<p class="paragraph">For personal information that is CDR data, please refer to our CDR policy for information on:</p>
										<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
											<p>the steps we take to ensure that the CDR data we are required or authorised to disclose is accurate, up to date and complete; and </p>
											<p>	the steps we will take if we receive a request from you to correct the CDR data that we have disclosed in relation to you. </p>
										
										</div>


                                        <p><strong>Right to object to processing</strong></p>


								

								<p class="paragraph">You can object to IBAL using your personal information for purposes outlined at paragraph 3 above if you have a justifiable reason. We will consider your objection and whether processing your personal information has any undue impact on you that would require us to stop processing your personal information.  </p>
								<p class="paragraph">You may not object to us processing your personal information if: </p>
								<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
										<p>We are legally required to do so; or</p>
										<p>It is necessary to fulfil a contract with you.</p>
										</div>



							
								<p class="paragraph">You can also object to receiving commercial messages from us. When you become an IBAL customer, we may ask you whether you want to receive marketing communications. Should you later change your mind, you can choose to opt out of receiving these messages. For example, you can manage your preferences on our website. </p>


								<p class="paragraph">In addition, even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we will alert you to unusual activity on your account, such as:</p>
								<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
										<p>When your credit or debit card is blocked;</p>
										<p>When a transaction is requested from an unusual location. </p>
										</div>


                                        <p><strong>Right to object to automated decisions </strong></p>


							
								<p class="paragraph">We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information if this is necessary to fulfil a contract with you, or if you gave us consent to do so. You have the right to object to such automated decisions (for in relation to credit scoring as explained above) and ask for an actual person to make the decision instead.</p>
										
                                <p><strong>Right to restrict processing </strong></p>
					
								<p class="paragraph">You have the right to ask us to restrict using your personal information if:</p>
								<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
										<p>You believe the personal information  is inaccurate;</p>
										<p>We are processing the personal information  unlawfully; </p>
										<p>We no longer need the personal information , but you want us to keep it for use in a legal claim;</p>
										<p>You have objected to us processing your personal information for the purposes described at paragraph 3 above.</p>
										</div>
								

                                        <p><strong>Right to data portability</strong></p>
						
								<p class="paragraph">You have the right to ask us to transfer your personal information directly to you or to another company. This applies to personal information you have provided us directly and that we process by automated means with your consent or on the basis of a contract with you. Where technically feasible, and based on applicable local law, we will transfer your personal information.</p>

                                <p><strong>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)</strong></p>

								<p class="paragraph">IBAL is sometimes legally obliged to keep your personal information. However, if you exercise your right to be forgotten, we will erase your personal information when:  </p>
								<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
										<p>We no longer need it for its original purpose;</p>
										<p>You withdraw your consent for processing it;  </p>
										<p>You object to us processing your personal information for the purposes described at paragraph 3 above or for commercial messages;</p>
										<p>IBAL unlawfully processes your personal information; or</p>
										<p>Local law requires IBAL to erase your personal information.  </p>
										</div>

                                        <p><strong>Right to complain</strong></p>

						
								<p class="paragraph">Should you as a customer, or a customer’s representative, be unsatisfied with the way we have responded to your concerns, you have the right to submit a complaint to us. For example, if you have any complaints about how IBAL has handled your personal information or you wish to make a complaint about how IBAL has breached the Australian Privacy Principles, Division 3 of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act or the Privacy (Credit Reporting Code) 2014. If you are still unhappy with our reaction to your complaint, you can escalate it to the ING Bank data protection officer. </p>

									<br>
										<i>Handling your complaints</i>
										</p>

								<div class="content-style dot paragraph">
										<p>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within 24 hours; and</p>
										<p>resolve your complaint within 28 days. In certain circumstances that may not be possible. If we form the view that we can't resolve your complaint within 28 days, we will notify you of the reason for the delay and the expected timeframe to resolve your complaint.
												 </p>
										</div>




								<p><Strong>Right to withdraw consent</Strong></p>
								<p class="paragraph">If you have given your consent to us for specific processing of your personal information as set out in Section 3 (What do we do with your personal information), you can at any time withdraw your consent. From that moment, we are no longer allowed to process your personal information. Please be aware that such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>

                                <p><Strong>Exercising your rights</Strong></p>
								<p class="paragraph">To exercise any of the rights as set out above, please send your request using the contact details at paragraph 11 below.</p>

                                <p class="paragraph">
                                    When exercising your right, the more specific you are with your request, the better we can assist you. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In some cases we may deny your request and, if permitted by law, we will notify you of the reason for denial of your request. If permitted by law, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing your request.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="paragraph">
                                        We want to address your request as quickly as possible. However, based on your location and applicable laws, the response times may vary. Should we require more time (than what is normally permitted by law) to complete your request, we will notify you immediately and provide reasons for the delay. 
                                        </p>
								

							

								<h3>8. Retention </h3>
								<p class="paragraph">We do not store your personal information longer than we need to for the purposes (as set out in Section 3 (What do we do with your personal information)), for which we have processed it. This will be in most cases at least 7 years from the data of providing the relevant document except for customer verification records which are retained until the end of customer relationships. Sometimes we use different storage periods. For example, if the supervisory authority requires us to store certain personal information longer or if you have filed a complaint that makes it necessary to keep the underlying personal information for a longer period. If we no longer need your personal information as described above, we delete or anonymize the personal information, in accordance with regulatory provisions and applicable law.</p>


								<h3>9. How we protect your personal information</h3>
								<p class="paragraph">We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the availability, confidentiality and integrity of your personal information and the way it is processed. This includes state-of-the-art IT security, system and access controls, security monitoring, segregation of duties, etc. We apply an internal framework of policies and minimum standards across all our business to keep your personal information safe. These policies and standards are periodically reviewed to keep them up to date with regulations and market developments. </p>
								<p class="paragraph">In addition, IBAL employees are subject to confidentiality obligations and may not disclose your personal information unlawfully or unnecessarily. To help us continue to protect your personal information, you should always contact IBAL if you suspect that your personal information may have been compromised.</p>


								<h3>10. Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3>
								<p class="paragraph">We may amend this Privacy Statement to remain compliant with any changes in law and/or to reflect how our business processes personal information. This version was approved on 28 March 2024. </p>
							

								<h3>11. Contact and questions </h3>
