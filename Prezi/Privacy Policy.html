                                    We recognize and respect your privacy.&nbsp; That means we only collect information we must have to fulfill our commitments and obligations to you.&nbsp; If we do not need the information, we do not request it.
                                </li><li>
                                    We implement technology solutions (including encryption), process controls, and trained people to secure the data we do collect.
                                </li><li>We do not sell your personal information – PERIOD.</li><li>
                                    We greatly limit who has access to your personal information to those with a job role that specifically supports a business purpose to support or fulfill our obligations.
                                </li><li>We do not transact business with minors nor do we use the information of minors for any commercial purposes.</li><li>We collect information via our website (including our contact form) and via information you provide to us.</li><li>
                                    We have a record retention policy governing how long we retain information.&nbsp; We only keep your information as long as we need to in order to fulfill our obligations to you and to meet any legal or regulatory requirements we are subject to (ie taxes, know your customer, payroll).

                                    This privacy policy addresses all personal information we may collect across customers, partners, employees, etc.&nbsp; For this reason, you may find some data references that seem odd to you; this is likely because we do not collect that type of information for your category.&nbsp; For example, we do not collect job history on customers but we do for employees.

                                    We do use cookies, primarily those for analytic data that are aggregated (not specific to you).&nbsp; We may use some cookies to customize your experience; particularly if you have a customer portal or supplier portal account.

                                In order to protect both the Personal Data and the general information that we receive from you through your use of the Services, we have implemented various security measures. For example, when you enter personal information (such as your contact information) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security (TLS). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
                            </p><p>‍</p><h3>Risk of Interception</h3><p>
                                Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out Personal Data online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that Data. While we strive to protect your Personal Data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Services, and any Personal Data, general information, or other data or information is provided to us at your own risk.

                                As a general rule, we retain your Personal Data for as long as you have an account, and for up to three years thereafter. If you are not a user from a Designated Country, we may retain a back-up copy of your Private or Public User Content potentially with Personal Data in it, indefinitely. We will only retain your information to the extent:
                            </p><ol role="list"><li>it is needed for the purposes which we have conveyed to you;</li><li>we are required by law to maintain such information; or</li><li>it is needed for us to address any issues or inquiries that you may have;</li><li>
                                    the processing purpose constitutes a legitimate interest.
                                    <br /><br /></li></ol><p>We dispose of Personal Data by destroying it, erasing it or anonymizing it.</p><p>
                                We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a legitimate business interest in retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.
                            </p><p>
                                Once you delete your account, a presentation or a video we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a presentation or a video public, the presentation or the video or its parts, including the incorporated data, may still be discoverable via search engines and similar online resources. We have no control over search engines; however, you may send a request for deletion to major search engines in some cases.
                            </p><p>
                                If we receive legal process pertaining to your account or have other legal document retention requirements, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with our preservation obligations. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your Personal Data to defend or assert our rights.

When we share information of our users in the Designated Countries, we make use of each of the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Data Protection Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.
                            </p><p>‍</p><h3>Limitation of Liability</h3><p>

                                However, we may offer You certain financial incentives permitted by the applicable data protection regulation that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any regulation permitted financial incentive (currently provided for under the CCPA) we offer will reasonably relate to Your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires Your prior opt in consent, which You may revoke at any time.
