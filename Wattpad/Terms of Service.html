To be able to continue to do so, we display third party advertisements and promotions on or in connection with the Service.

Your interactions with advertisers found on or through the Service, including, without limitation, all reliance upon advertising, all commercial transactions and legal obligations associated with such advertisements, are solely between you and the advertisers.</p><p>If you wish to find out more information about the practices of these third party advertisers and your choices about how your personal information may be used by them, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p><a class="back-to-top mobile">Back to top</a></div></div><div id="general-terms"><div class="content-block"><span class="back-to-top desktop">Back to top</span><h2 class="subtitle">General Terms</h2><p><strong>Changes</strong>. Our Terms of Service may change from time to time. If they do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. Please note that your continued use of the Services after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Terms of Service. If you disagree with any changes in the Terms of Service and do not wish to be subject to the revised terms, you will need to close your account and/or stop using the Services.</p><p><strong>Entire agreement</strong>. These Terms of Service (including any document incorporated by reference into them) are the whole agreement between Wattpad and you concerning the Services, and these Terms of Service supersede and replace any prior agreements between Wattpad and you regarding the Services.</p><p><strong>No waiver and severability</strong>. If Wattpad doesn’t exercise or enforce a particular right or provision under these Terms of Service, that doesn’t mean we’ve waived that right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>Choice of law and jurisdiction</strong>. We at Wattpad encourage you to contact us if you’re having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada that apply in Ontario, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will take place in the courts of the Province of Ontario.</p><p><strong>Assignment</strong>. These Terms of Service are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Wattpad’s prior written consent.
