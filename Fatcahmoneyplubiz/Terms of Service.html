FASTCASHMONEYPLUS.biz provides serivices to you subject to agreements, notices, terms, and agreements set forth in this agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”).

      <h2 class="sectionHeader">SECTION 2. Forward Looking Statements & Projections</h2>
      <p><strong>All references to "cash", "fast cash", and "money", refer specifically to FASTCASH, and NOT US Dollars, Great British Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other crypto or fiat currencies, unless clearly specified. All mentions of "wealth", "affluence", "prosperity", "fortune", "becoming rich", "investment returns", and so forth, strictly refer to a subjective, intangible definition of wealth, more closely resembling one's personal satisfaction with their own life, rather than an arbitrary quantity of non-FastCash-related currency.</strong></p>

      <p>Certain information provided through this Website contains forward-looking statements with respect to FastCashMoneyPlus.biz's future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "certainly", "absolutely", "undoubtedly", "opportunity", "achieve", "believe", "pipeline", "expect", "anticipate", "assume", "outlook", and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will", "would", "should", "could", "may", or similar expressions.</p>

      <p>The speculations quoted represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s FastCash, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>

      <p>In addition to risk factors previously disclosed, and those identified elsewhere in this Website, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management; (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (6) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (5) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property and information security protection; (10) terrorist activities, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, or domestic and local financial and capital markets; (11) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (15) the impact of FastCashMoneyPlus.biz electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (16) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions.</p>
