        <h4>Purposes for Collecting Personal Information</h4>
<p>As described in more detail in the “How We Use Personal Data” section above, we collect personal information to provide and manage the Services, process and fulfill orders, to support and market our business, and to achieve other legitimate business or commercial purposes.</p>
<h4>Disclosures of Personal Information</h4>
<p>As detailed in the “How We Use Personal Data” section above, we disclose personal information to fulfill the purposes described. We will also disclose certain categories of personal information to competent governmental and public authorities and other third parties as necessary or appropriate, including when we have a legal or contractual obligation to disclose the information.</p>
<h4>Sale and Sharing of Personal Information</h4>
<p>As detailed in the chart above, we “sell” and “share” (as such terms are defined in the CCPA) certain categories of personal information to and with third parties and have “sold” and “shared” certain categories of Personal Data in the past twelve (12) months. Please refer to the chart above for additional details.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of individuals under the age of 16.</p>
<h4>Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</h4>
<p>As detailed in the chart above, we collect certain “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA). However, we do not use or disclose such information for any purpose outside of the limited permissible purposes set forth in the regulations implementing the CCPA. Such purposes include providing the Services and verifying, maintaining the quality of, and improving the Services.</p>
<h4>Your Legal Rights</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we:</p>
<ul><li>Disclose to you the following information covering the twelve (12) months preceding your request:<ul><li>the categories of personal information we have collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected such information;</li><li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;</li><li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information about you;</li><li>the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such personal information; and</li><li>if we sold, shared, or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:<ul><li>sales and shares, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient received; and</li><li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing.</li><li>Delete the personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</li></ul>
<p>We will not discriminate against you if you decide to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Please note that certain rights are subject to applicable exceptions under the CCPA.</p>
<h4>How to Exercise Your Legal Rights</h4>
<p>You can submit a request to exercise your rights under the CCPA by:</p>
<ul><li>Calling us at 1-800-468-1714.</li><li>Completing and submitting the form available <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8d63d436-e043-400a-9774-e8e30a15446a/308fa746-fa9b-4cc2-9967-96097ab22c29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul>
<p>To protect your privacy, we will require the matching of up to three pieces of personal information provided with your request with information we maintain to verify that it is you making the request. Where applicable, we will use the requested information for verification purposes only. Please note that we may decline a request where we are unable to verify your identity and confirm the personal information we maintain relates to you.</p>
<p>Exercising your rights does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
<h4>Authorized Agents</h4>
<p>You may authorize someone to submit a request on your behalf (an “<strong>authorized agent</strong>”). An authorized agent will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf, unless you have provided the agent with power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. Depending on the evidence provided, we may also contact you to verify your identity with us or request confirmation from you that the agent is authorized to submit the request on your behalf.</p>
<h4>How to Exercise Your Sale and Sharing Opt-Out Right</h4>
<p>As detailed in the chart above, we “sell” and “share” certain categories of personal information to and with third parties. If you are 16 years of age or older, in addition to the rights described above, you have the right to direct us to not “sell” or “share” your personal information at any time. To exercise your opt-out right, you may submit a request to us by:</p>
<ul><li>Completing and submitting the form available <a href="https://www.hersheyland.com/home/personal-data-request.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (note that the form is also accessible via the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in the footer of the Website).</li><li>Calling us at 1-800-468-1714.</li></ul>
<p>Upon receipt of your request, we will endeavor to honor it based on the information that we collect and maintain.</p>
<p>Alternatively, where available, you can use certain preference signals to exercise your opt-out right automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including Hershey. If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with the CCPA, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each once that you use.</p>
<p>An authorized agent may also use the methods described above to submit a request to opt out on your behalf if you provide the agent with signed permission to do so. Please note that we may request from the agent documentation demonstrating that they have your authority to act on your behalf.</p>
<h4>Notice of Financial Incentive</h4>
<p>We may provide discounts or promotions when you agree to receive marketing and promotional communications from us or claim a specific offer when you interact with us and/or the Website (each, an “<strong>Offer</strong>”). The terms of each Offer will be provided to you when it is made available. You may opt out of marketing and promotional communications from us at any time as described in our messages to you and as described in the “Your Choices and Legal Rights” section above.</p>
<p>We collect and retain personal information to support and fulfill certain Offers, which may include information in the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>Identifiers (like your name and email address)</li><li>Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute</li><li>Commercial information (like your purchase history)</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li><li>Geolocation data</li><li>Inferences</li></ul>
<p>The personal information we collect and retain may also be used to make your account or to supplement your account information (where applicable). Additional details regarding our use of personal information can be found in the “How We Use Personal Data” section above.</p>
<p>Because we collect and retain personal information in connection with our administration of certain Offers, they may be considered “financial incentives” or “price or service differences” under California law. The value of the personal information we collect will vary based on the Offer and is calculated based on expenses related to offering the Offer, which may include the costs associated with providing discounts or promotions, IP or marketing-related costs, and other related expenses.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt out of any Offer at any time in accordance with the terms of the Offer or by contacting us using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section below.</p>
