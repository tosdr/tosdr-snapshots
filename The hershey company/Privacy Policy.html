<h2>4. Our Use of Social Media Features and Widgets</h2>
<p>The Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, and widgets, such as the “share this” button or other interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address and other data about your visit to the Website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

<h2>5. Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
<p>We engage in interest-based advertising to deliver online, relevant advertising to you. We also permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect data about your use of the Website over time so that they may display advertisements tailored to you both on the Website and on third-party online services and across the devices you may use.</p>
<p>Generally, the data used to deliver interest-based advertising to you is collected through cookies or other similar technologies. These technologies collect data about your browser and device (e.g., IP address, device ID, cookie ID, mobile advertising ID, general location information, and geolocation information (with your consent)) and your activity on the Website. These technologies may also collect similar data on other websites you visit and across the devices you use, and such data may be linked to certain online and offline data.

<ul><li>You can limit our use of targeting cookies through our cookie management tool, available here.</li><li>You may be able to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising using the browser opt-out tools and consumer choice mechanisms provided by interest-based advertising self-regulatory groups by following the links below:<ul><li>Network Advertising Alliance (NAI): <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a><br />
