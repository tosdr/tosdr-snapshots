This user account can be a trial account ("Sing Up Friend" account), or can be attached to a single-user Membership account (e.g. Choir Leader Membership), or a multi-user Membership account (e.g. account owned by a school or organisation). A Sing Up user can at any time become part of a Membership account, move Membership accounts, or detach from a Membership account and become a trial account again. Sing Up user accounts are not subject to an expiry date and will remain registered until the account is closed either by yourself or by Sing Up (subject to 9.4. to 9.6.).</p>
<p><b>6.2. Trial account. </b>A Sing Up user not attached to a Membership account, will enjoy the benefits of a trial account ("Sing Up Friend" account) with full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free.

Trial account users have the ability to purchase Sing Up Membership by purchasing first time Membership for a new Membership account (single-user or multi-user Membership account) or by renewing Membership for an existing Membership account (multi-user Membership account only).

Expired or dormant single-user Membership accounts enjoy full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free. Any non-trial resources can be previewed only. Any resources downloaded, unlocked, or saved while having active single-user Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.</p>
<p>Single-user Membership accounts belong to and are used by one individual, and thus access to Sing Up resources through this Membership account cannot be shared by more than one individual. The Sing Up user, who placed the first Membership order for this account, will be identified as the owner of the single-user Membership account. Ownership of a single-user Membership account is not transferable.</p>
<p><b>6.4. Multi-user Membership account.&nbsp;</b>A school, Music Education Hub, Music Service, Multi-Academy Trust, or any other organisation is represented within Sing Up by a multi-user Membership account, and all Sing Up Memberships for the school or organisation will be attached to this Membership account.</p>

Expired or dormant multi-user Membership accounts enjoy full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free.

Any resources downloaded, unlocked, and saved while having active Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.</p>
<p>Multi-user Membership accounts belong to the school or organisation and access to the Membership account and Membership benefits can be shared by more than one Sing Up user,&nbsp;so long as the Sing Up users are current employees of the school or organisation (subject to 7.2.).<br> Multi-user Membership accounts belonging to a Music Education Hub, Music Service, Multi-Academy Trust, or similar ("partner organisation")&nbsp;(subject to <a href="/partner-terms">Additional Terms - Sing Up Partner Membership</a>) include one free of charge Sing Up user with access the Membership account.

Until deleted, a Student user account stays part of the Membership account it was created under.</p>
<p>The owner of the Membership account is taking responsibility of any student data submitted to Sing Up, and in complying with data protection laws applicable. Students &amp; Groups Manager administrators are taking responsibility for the management of Student user accounts on Sing Up.</p>
<p>Student users receive access to resources via the Student Area under <a href="https://student.singup.org/" target="_blank">student.singup.org</a> and cannot access resources on <a href="/">www.singup.org</a>. Student users inherit the Membership status as well as Membership benefits from their parent Membership account.

This may include disclosing any relevant information to the relevant law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p><b>9.7. Disputes.</b> In the event of any disputes arising, Sing Up will endeavour to provide analytical information on your usage for purposes of clarification, but has no liability to do so.

<h3><a href="/terms-and-conditions" name="Songs_resources">10. Sing Up Songs and Resources</a></h3>
<p><b>10.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Access to songs and resources.</b> Sing Up users will have access to high quality songs and resources via the Site and the Song Bank. All songs and resources made available are subject to the Sing Up account type (subject to 6.2. to 6.4.), as well as copyright and license restrictions.</p>
<p>Songs and resources will normally need to be unlocked by the use of the allowance (subject to 11.1. to 11.6.), except if free access is provided. Free access to songs and resources may be time limited and Sing Up reserve the right to change, amend, or withdraw access to free songs and resources.

Song sheets are available for a period of 12 weeks uninterrupted, as long as active Membership is held. Song sheets can be re-unlocked after the 12 weeks have passed.</p>
<p><b>10.2.&nbsp; Playlists. </b>Playlists created by a Sing Up user belong to that Sing Up user and are not transferable. When a Sing Up user has access to a Membership account (subject to 6.3. and 6.4.), and until this user is removed from the Membership account, this user’s playlists will be shared with any Sing Up user attached to the Membership account.</p>
<p><b>10.3.&nbsp; Trial account. </b>With a trial account (subject to 6.2.), access to a limited number of selected trial resources is available, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free, subject to copyright and license restrictions.</p>
<p>Songs and resources accessed as part of a trial account are for the sole use of the individual owning the trial account. Songs and resources may not be shared with others as this is against the law and deemed to be ‘file sharing’. This is because it prevents the copyright holders from being paid when their music or lyrics are used.</p>
<p><b>10.4. Single-user Membership account.</b> A Sing Up user with access to an active single-user Membership account (subject to 6.3.) can access any songs and resources published on the Site, subject to copyright and license restrictions.</p>
<p>A Sing Up user with access to an expired or dormant single-user Membership account can enjoy full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free. Any resources downloaded, unlocked, and saved while having active single-user Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.</p>
<p>Songs and resources accessed as part of a single-user Membership account are for the sole use of the individual owning the single-user Membership account. Songs and resources may not be shared with others as this is against the law and deemed to be ‘file sharing’. This is because it prevents the copyright holders from being paid when their music or lyrics are used.</p>
<p><b>10.5. Multi-user Membership account.</b> A Sing Up user with access to an active multi-user Membership account (subject to 6.4.) can access any songs and resources published on the Site, subject to copyright and license restrictions.</p>

Any resources downloaded, unlocked, and saved while having active multi-user Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.</p>
<p>Any Sing Up user with access to a multi-user Membership account is part of this account’s community. Thus, access to Sing Up songs and resources through a multi-user Membership account is shared by all Sing Up users attached to the multi-user Membership account. Songs and resources accessed by a Sing Up user as part of a multi-user Membership account may not be shared with anyone not actively employed by the school or organisation owning the Membership, as this is against the law and deemed to be ‘file sharing’. This is because it prevents the copyright holders from being paid when their music or lyrics are used.<br> &nbsp;</p>
