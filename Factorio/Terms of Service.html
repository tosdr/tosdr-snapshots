</ul>
<h3>VIDEO POLICY</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are a valid user of the game, you may use our content for the purpose of

    any provision of these Terms of Service has been invalid or unenforceable for any reason, this fact
    does not cause invalidity or ineffectiveness of other parts of the Terms of Service.</li>

    effect. Last update was on 31st October
    2018.</li>
