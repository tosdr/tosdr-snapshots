<b>Bittorrent.. what is it all about?</b><a name="#267" id="267"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
All general Questions about Bittorrent get answered on <a href="http://www.musiktransfer.com/redir.php?url=http://go.webassistant.com/wa/upload/users/u1000190/webpage_20096.html">Brians BitTorrent FAQ</a>.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why do I occasionally get PHP or SQL errors? Should I report them?</b><a name="#3" id="3"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
This can happen if an admin happens to be working on the database or the code at the time you are browsing the site.
Generally you do not have to report these errors, just wait a few minutes and things will most likely be back to normal.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>In which languages can I get support on the Helpdesk?</b><a name="#508" id="508"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
All members of the Staff can give support in <strong>English</strong>. Support can be provided in a limited set of other languages: <strong>Bahasa Melayu</strong>, <strong>Český</strong>, <strong>中文</strong>, <strong>Deutsch</strong>, <strong>ελληνικά</strong>, <strong>Español</strong>, <strong>Français</strong>, <strong>Italiano</strong>, <strong>日本語</strong>, <strong>한국어</strong>, <strong>Magyar</strong>, <strong>Nederlands</strong>, <strong>Slovenčina</strong>, <strong>Svenska</strong>, <strong>Português</strong> and <strong>Türkçe</strong>.<br/>
While a reply can be expected within a few hours for Help in English, an answer in another language can take more than a day, especially when the Staff member giving support in that language has to get expert advise within the team first. Therefore it is preferable you ask for help in English.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Where does the donated money go?</b><a name="#2" id="2"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Gaytorrent.ru is running on several dedicated servers. All money donated is used to cover the cost of the server farm.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What serves category voting and how to vote?</b><a name="#509" id="509"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Voting for categories is an improvement in preparation: Having multiple categories for a torrent and have the members deciding which are the best fitting categories for a torrent. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Voting is already possible and you get <u>Seed Bonus Points</u> for voting</strong>. For the allocation of categories, we need much more votes first.<strong> Please vote!</strong><br/>
<br/>
You can currently vote categories on torrents you have completed the download and you haven't voted upon. The voting possibility is located just under the category thumb nail at the top of the torrent description page. Click on "Please Vote" in "Please Vote up to 5 categories which match this torrent best", select up-to five categories and then on "Submit category vote".<br/>
<br/>
You find a list with your completed torrent downloads in your <strong>Profile</strong>. To go there click on your name in "Welcome back, ..." and then scroll down. <br/>
<br/>
Torrents for which you have already voted got a thumbs up sign in the torrent list.

<br/>
<b>I registered an account but did not receive the confirmation e-mail!</b><a name="#5" id="5"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
You can use <a class="altlink" href="delacct.php">this form</a> to delete the account so you can re-register.
Note though that if you didn't receive the email the first time it will probably not
succeed the second time either so you should really try another email address.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I've lost my user name or password! Can you send it to me?</b><a name="#7" id="7"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Please use <a class="altlink" href="lostpassword.php">this form</a> to have the login details mailed back to you.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Can you rename my account?</b><a name="#6" id="6"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
No!
We do not rename accounts. The only possibiliti is to first delete your old account (Use
<a href="delacct.php" class="altlink">this form</a> to delete your present account.)<br>
<b>But keep in mind that after you delete your old account there is a waiting time of 60 days
until you can create a new account</b><br>
<br>
Only after that time you can create your new account!
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Can you delete my (confirmed) account?</b><a name="#8" id="8"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
You can do it yourself by using <a href="delacct.php" class="altlink<span" style="color:#FFFF00">this form</a>.<br>
<br>
The delete account feature is only enabled if you have a ratio greater than 1.0<ul>
<li>unused accounts (both upload and download are zero) are disabled by the system after <strong>60 days</strong> of no login</li>
<li>used accounts with prior activity (upload and/or download) are disabled by the system after <strong>240 days</strong> of no login</li></ul>
<br>
Currently we don't support an account parking feature because all used accounts have the 240 days time frame.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>So, what's MY ratio?</b><a name="#9" id="9"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Click on your <a class="altlink" href="my.php">profile</a>, then on your user name (at the top).<br>
<br>
It's important to distinguish between your overall ratio and the individual ratio on each torrent
you may be seeding or leeching. The overall ratio takes into account the total uploaded and downloaded
from your account since you joined the site. The individual ratio takes into account those values for each torrent.<br>
<br>
You may see two symbols instead of a number: &quot;Inf.&quot;, which is just an abbreviation for Infinity, and
means that you have downloaded 0 bytes while uploading a non-zero amount (ul/dl becomes infinity); &quot;---&quot;,
which should be read as &quot;non-available&quot;, and shows up when you have both downloaded and uploaded 0 bytes
(ul/dl = 0/0 which is an indeterminate amount).
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why is my IP displayed on my details page?</b><a name="#11" id="11"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
No IPs are displayed over the whole System any longer.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>My IP address is dynamic. How do I stay logged in?</b><a name="#13" id="13"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to anymore. We implemented the Passkey System so after that, even if the IP changes mid-session,
the seeding or leeching will continue and the statistics will update without any problem.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why am I listed as not connectable? (And why should I care?)</b><a name="#14" id="14"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The tracker has determined that you are firewalled or NATed and cannot accept incoming connections.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I add an avatar to my profile?</b><a name="#15" id="15"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
First, find an image that you like, and that is within the
<a class="altlink" href="rules.php#100">rules</a>. Then you will have to upload it into our <a class="altlink" href="bitbucket.php">BitBucket</a>.To Show the Picture in your Profile, copy the URL you were given when uploading it to the avatar field in your <a class="altlink" href="my.php">profile</a>.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What's a 'passkey'?</b><a name="#16" id="16"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
A passkey is a key associated with your account that uniquely identifies you as a gaytorrent.ru user.<br><br>
When a .torrent file is downloaded from your account, the passkey is automatically added to the announce URL in the .torrent file. Therefore whenever that .torrent is used the tracker will associate it with your account, no matter what IP you are connecting from.<br><br>
<b>Make sure you keep your passkey and .torrent files private at all times.</b><br>
Do not give .torrent files you downloaded at gaytorrent.ru to someone else, do not upload it to other websites! Everybody connecting to the tracker using your .torrent file will leech from your account!
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I reset my passkey?</b><a name="#17" id="17"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to your page and request a new passkey.
Note that by using this you will invalidate all the .torrent files that you may have previously downloaded, and will have to download them again.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What's your .torrent/passkey sharing policy?</b><a name="#18" id="18"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
In order to prevent our .torrents from being uploaded to public sites (in effect turning this into a public tracker), there are a number of security measures in place. First among them is the following: if, at any time, there are more than 5 distinct IPs simultaneously using the same passkey with the same torrent, the account associated with the passkey will be automatically get a new passkey. This will also invalidate all your previously downloaded torrents!<br><br>
You may still seed/leech the same torrent from several PCs as long as you are careful not to exceed this limit.<br><br>
Note that this takes into account simultaneous connections only. If you have a dynamic IP and have to change it 100 times while downloading a torrent that it will not trigger this mechanism. (As long as you exit your client properly, there will only be one peer/IP at any time.)
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What is an invite?</b><a name="#551" id="551"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
When you become a Power User, you are given 4 free invites. These can be sent to other individuals you know to join Gaytorrent.ru. When they register a new account from the invite, you will given 2 GB of upload credit. Additional invites can be obtained by exchanged for seed bonus points at the <a href="https://www.gaytorrent.ru/getbonus.php"><u>Exchange</u></a><br>
<br>
But BE CAREFUL who you send invites. If they misuse their account, your account may also get banned. ONLY SEND INVITES TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW!!

Or you only want a better salary? To clear up the last question just now and here: salary? What is that supposed
to be??? As a sysop you pay your (admitted: bigger) salary to the admins. Otherwise you have to be quite knowledgable
(about five years work as a server should be enough) to start in this position.
But even then: don't hold your breath after an application.<br>

<br/>
<b>Most common reason for stats not updating</b><a name="#20" id="20"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>The user is cheating. (a.k.a. &quot;Summary Ban&quot;)</li>
<li>The server is overloaded and unresponsive. Just try to keep the session open
until the server responds again. (Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates is not recommended.)</li>
<li>You are using a faulty client. If you want to use an experimental or CVS version you do it at your own risk.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Best practices</b><a name="stats2"></a><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If a torrent you are currently leeching/seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait or force a manual update.</li>
<li>Make sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives &quot;event=completed&quot;.</li>
<li>If the tracker is down, do not stop seeding. As long as the tracker is back up before you exit the client the stats
should update properly.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>May I use any bittorrent client?</b><a name="#21" id="21"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, except these banned Clients:<br>
<ul>
<li>µTorrent (below versions 1.8.1) <img alt="New" border="1px" src="pic/new.png" /></li>
<li> BitComet (below version 0.69)</li>
<li> Bitlord</li>
<li> ABC</li>
<li>Bitspirit</li>
<li>TorrentStorm</li>
<li>Burst!</li>
<li>BitBuddy</li>
<li>Shareaza</li>
<li>XBT</li>
<li>TurboBT</li>
<li>Thunder a.k.a. Xunlei</li>
</ul><br><br>
The tracker now updates the stats correctly for all capable bittorrent clients. However, we still recommend
that you <b>avoid</b> the following clients:<br>
<br>
&#149; BitTorrent++,<br>
&#149; Nova Torrent,<br>
<br>
These clients do not report correctly to the tracker when cancelling/finishing a torrent session.
If you use them then a few MB may not be counted towards the stats near the end, and torrents may still be listed in your profile for some time after you have closed the client.<br>
<br>
Also, clients in alpha or beta version should be avoided.<br>
Furthermore we recommend <b>not</b> to use so called multiprotocol clients like Limewire, Shareaza, Ares, Free Download Manager and whatever there is available in that category.
Those clients are usually only good for one protocol for which they were originally programmed and support BitTorrent only rudimentary, sometimes with wrong stats or reporting one download finished a lot of times.
Use such clients at your own risk. We will answer support questions for them only with one sentence: uninstall that client and use a decent and capable BitTorrent only client!
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why is a torrent I'm leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?</b><a name="#22" id="22"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If for some reason (e.g. pc crash, or frozen client) your client exits improperly and you restart it,
it will have a new peer_id, so it will show as a new torrent. The old one will never receive a &quot;event=completed&quot;
or &quot;event=stopped&quot; and will be listed until some tracker timeout. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I've finished or cancelled a torrent. Why is it still listed in my profile?</b><a name="#23" id="23"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Some clients, notably TorrentStorm and Nova Torrent, do not report properly to the tracker when canceling or finishing a torrent.
In that case the tracker will keep waiting for some message - and thus listing the torrent as seeding or leeching - until some
timeout occurs. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why do I sometimes see torrents I'm not leeching in my profile!?</b><a name="#24" id="24"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
When a torrent is first started, the tracker uses the IP to identify the user. Therefore the torrent will
become associated with the user <i>who last accessed the site</i> from that IP. If you share your IP in some
way (you are behind NAT/ICS, or using a proxy), and some of the persons you share it with are also users,
you may occasionally see their torrents listed in your profile. (If they start a torrent session from that
IP and you were the last one to visit the site the torrent will be associated with you). Note that now
torrents listed in your profile will always count towards your total stats.
<br>
<br>
To make sure your torrents show up in your profile you should visit the site immediately before starting a session.
<br>
<br>
(The only way to completely stop foreign torrents from showing in profiles is to forbid users without
an individual IP from accessing the site. Yes, that means you. Complain at your own risk.)
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Multiple IPs (Can I login from different computers?)</b><a name="#25" id="25"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the tracker is now capable of following sessions from different IPs for the same user. A torrent is associated with
the user when it starts, and only at that moment is the IP relevant. So if you want to seed/leech from computer A
and computer B with the same account you should access the site from computer A, start the torrent there, and then repeat both
steps from computer B (not limited to two computers or to a single torrent on each, this is just the simplest example).
You do not need to login again when closing the torrent.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How does NAT/ICS change the picture?</b><a name="#26" id="26"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a very particular case in that all computers in the LAN will appear to the outside world as having the same IP. We must distinguish
between two cases:<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> <i>You are the single Gaytorrent.ru users in the LAN</i><br>
<br>
You should use the same Gaytorrent.ru account in all the computers.<br>
<br>
Note also that in the ICS case it is preferable to run the BT client on the ICS gateway. Clients running on the other computers
will be unconnectable (they will be listed as such, as explained elsewhere in the FAQ) unless you specify
the appropriate services in your ICS configuration (a good explanation of how to do this for Windows XP can be found
<a class="altlink" href="redir.php?url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1dcff3ce-f50f-4a34-ae67-cac31ccd7bc9&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>).
In the NAT case you should configure different ranges for clients on different computers and create appropriate NAT rules in the router. (Details vary widely from router to router and are outside the scope of this FAQ. Check your router documentation and/or support forum.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <i>There are multiple Gaytorrent.ru users in the LAN</i><br>
<br>
At present there is no way of making this setup always work properly with Gaytorrent.ru.
Each torrent will be associated with the user who last accessed the site from within
the LAN before the torrent was started.
Unless there is cooperation between the users mixing of statistics is possible.
(User A accesses the site, downloads a .torrent file, but does not start the torrent immediately.
Meanwhile, user B accesses the site. User A then starts the torrent. The torrent will count
towards user B's statistics, not user A's.)
<br>
<br>
It is your LAN, the responsibility is yours. Do not ask us to ban other users
with the same IP, we will not do that. (Why should we ban <i>him</i> instead of <i>you</i>?)

<b>How to Reseed?</b><a name="#505" id="505"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
To restart seeding a torrent which is removed from the torrent client programme, use the existing torrent on GayTorrent.ru and make the torrent programme find the movie file you've got already.
<br/><br/>
Here a quite universal way to achieve that:
<ol>
<li>Copy the movie/data file(s) into the default download folder/directory of the torrent client programme. That is where new downloads go first.</li>
<li> Go-to the description page of the torrent to reseed and click "Download" to get the .torrent file and open it with your torrent programme. The torrent programme shall find the files(s) already being there, check it to 100% and start seeding.</li>
</ol>
It might be necessary to force a re-check. If it starts downloading the movie, <strong>stop</strong> immediately, something went wrong. Note that the file name(s) must be those used in the torrent's file list.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I upload a new torrent?</b><a name="#29" id="29"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<style type="text/css">
 .red {color: red;}
</style>
First, create the .torrent file in you favourite programme for torrents. Use http://tracker.gaytorrent.ru:2710/announce as tracker URL and set <strong>not</strong> to start seeding immediately. Consult the client's manual in case of questions/problems. Read the <a href="uploadguide.php">Upload-Guide</a>.<br>
<br>
Then browse the "<strong>Upload</strong>" page (menu on top of the page), click "I have read and understand". Then fill the web form step by step, start to select the category, upload pictures and specify some basic information like the name to be displayed and a comment. Only fields with a red star "<span class="red">*</span>" are mandatory. Then select the .torrent file and click "<strong>Do it!</strong>" to upload the torrent file. <br>
<br>
After uploading the torrent you created, you'll be lead to the created description page and must download the .torrent file containing the announce-URL with your personal secrete passkey. Otherwise your won't be able to seed! Detailed instructions are given on the upload page. <br>
<br>
Now open the .torrent file (the one you downloaded, not the one you created!) in your programme for torrents. Typically it will show a window to confirm the download location: direct it to the file(s) from which you created the torrent. The programme will check the files integrity, which may take some time, and then contact the tracker. If this contact succeeds, the .torrent is ready for being reviewed. You might want to check your Profile and look for your torrent, just to be sure it is seed.<br>
<br>
New uploads are listed immediately and <strong>not</strong> reviewed by staff. It is the uploader's responsibility to ensure his upload adheres to the rules. <img alt="Updated" border="1px" src="pic/updated.png" /><br>
<br>
Members can see the torrent in the "Search" and "Browse" list, will download the torrent and your upload starts finally.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What bandwidth do I need for seeding a torrent?</b><a name="#30" id="30"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are the first seeder of a new torrent, make sure you dedicate <b>as much bandwith as possible</b> to upload this torrent. The bandwith for a new torrent should be at least 20kb/s, the more the better of course.
Please stop all other up- and / or downloads. <br><br>
Especially when uploading a big torrent, make sure you have enough bandwidth to seed at least one full copy in a decent time. It does not make sens to seed a 1GB file on a 56k connection as it would take forever to spread the file!<br><br>
If you are unsure about what you can upload, ask on the Helpdesk first. They can help you to find out the right file-sizes for your internet-connection
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How long should I seed a torrent?</b><a name="#31" id="31"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are the first seeder of a torrent you uploaded yourself, you must seed the file at least until three
complete copies (as seeders) are listed on the "Download" page of the tracker! Do not stop seeding a torrent before that time as this will result in a dead torrent!<br><br>
Don't forget: There is no easier possibillity to push up your ratio than to let a torrent stay seeding in your client,
as long as other clients want to have a piece of that cake.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What kind of torrent should I upload?</b><a name="#32" id="32"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Porn: Gay, Bisexual or Straight</li>
<li>Non-Porn: Anything LGBTQ themed. Male adult physique/voyeurism material is accepted, such as: wrestling, bodybuilding, sports and underwear/swimwear.</li>
<li>Prohibited: Music, Music Videos, Commercial Applications/Software</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How many torrents should I seed at the same time?</b><a name="#33" id="33"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're the first seeder, please make sure that you can spread the torrent uploaded as fast as possible. To achieve that, do not upload more than 1 big torrent at the same time, stop seeding of other torrents and dedicate all your upload bandwidth to the torrents you want to spread.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What is &#8220;Seed Bonus&#8221;, how is it computed and how do I improve my Ratio using it?</b><a name="#266" id="266"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Our &#8216;Seed Bonus&#8217; is a way of encouraging our members to seed files. Very simply put, after you finish a download, leave it on and it will continue to &#8216;seed&#8217; to other members who are downloading (leeching) the file. You are therefore seeding!<br><br>
The bonus is computed on how many hours you leave any files on &#8216;seed&#8217;. For every hour you have a file (or multiple files) seeding you get .5 points for every hour. In other words you get ONE point for every TWO hours you seed!<br><br>
The bonus you get depends on your choice. There are four levels of &#8216;bonus&#8217; (the bonus is the number of GB&#8217;s that will be added to your &#8220;Total Upload&#8221; number. The levels you can choose from are:<br><br>
<table border="0">
<colgroup>
<col width="10%">
<col width="5%">
<col width="10%">
<col width="75%">
<col>
</colgroup>
<tr><th>Seed Bonus Points</th><th align="center">-</th><th align="right">Upload GB Bonus</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr>

<tr><td>600</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="right">10.0 GB</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table><br><br>
YOU chose when and at what level you want to get your Bonus Points, just click on the &#8220;Seed Bonus&#8221; and it will allow you to select to use your points to increase your upload amount and thus improve your ratio.<br><br>
Remember that your ratio is calculated as <b>up</b>load amount divided by <b>down</b>load amount. So increased upload will also increase your ratio.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Is there something special to consider when uploading a DVD?</b><a name="#489" id="489"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Not really, when you keep in mind we have a lot of members. Not all of our members have the latest computer equipment
and you are interested in sharing your DVD with as many members as possible.<br>
What are the special topics then?<br>
There are different methods to rip a DVD
<ul>
<li>an Image file (.iso, .img ...) and</li>
<li>a DVD folder structure</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Uploading an image file:</b><br>
<br>
Image files seem to be the most simple method to rip a DVD - but beware: an image file is a single file which will be
easily greater than 2 GB in size. As mentioned before - such big files can easily make it impossible to download such
a file because of some (older) file systems are not capable of handling files greater 2 GB in size. That is the reason
we do not like image uploads at all.
<br><br>
There are some programs which can split a big image file into smaller parts (size 1 GB) or so named file.I00,
file.I01... but that is also not a real good solution because you need a descriptor file to describe the complete
ISO image (named file.MDS) and special programs which are able to burn a DVD from such a descriptor file and all
accompanying split image parts.
<br><br>
<b>Uploading a DVD Folder structure</b><br><br>
This is a much simpler option. You just have to take care of some naming conventions:<br>
<br>
Create a folder named like the DVD. This will be the folder to create the torrent from (like the root of the DVD).<br>
<br>
Inside this folder must be at least one other folder, named
&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO_TS - (the video content of the DVD) - all DVDs have another empty folder:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AUDIO_TS - this folder is not used for Videos though but only for Music DVDs.<br>
<br>
in the VIDEO_TS folder there are the video files starting with<br>
<br>
VIDEO_TS.IFO<br>
VIDEO_TS.BUP<br>
VIDEO_TS.VOB *<br>
<br>
(describing the structure of the (different) titles on the DVD like Main feature, Bonus features, ..., the file
VIDEO_TS.VOB may be ommitted in some cases)<br>
<br>
and the real Video files<br>
<br>
VTS_01_0.IFO<br>
VTS_01_0.BUP<br>
VTS_01_0.VOB *<br>
VTS_01_1.VOB<br>
... up to<br>
VTS_01_9.VOB<br>
<br>
for the first video title on the DVD and the corresponding next title files are named<br>
<br>
VTS_02_x.IFO/BUB/VOB for the second title ...<br>
<br>
May go up to VTS_99_x.IFO/BUP/VOB<br>
<br>
* also here the VTS_xy_0.VOB file might be missing in some cases, depending on the menu structure of the DVD.<br>
<br>
Now a word about the file extensions:<br>
<br>
the IFO files are information files and contain important tables about where each title is located on the disc,
chapter points, age restrictions and a lot more. These IFO files are necessary to play a DVD and must be included! They are so important
that there are backup files for them on each and every DVD, the .BUP files. Those are simply backups for the IFO files
and will be used by the DVD player in case they get a read error in the IFO file. Also they must be included!<br>
<br>
The VOB files are the video content - they are essential too of course.<br>
<br>
Now we have the complete structure for our upload:<br>
<br>
Title_folder for the DVD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AUDIO_TS (*1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO_TS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO_TS.IFO<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO_TS.BUP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIDEO_TS.VOB (*2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VTS_01_0.IFO<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VTS_01_0.BUP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VTS_01_0.VOB (*2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VTS_01_1.VOB<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
<br>
and this structure is mandatory to burn a playable DVD from the download.<br>
<br>
*1 : the AUDIO_TS folder is usually empty<br>
*2 : files may be missing due to the structure of the DVD<br>
<br>
So we ask you to rip this structure from a DVD, move (or directly rip) it in a folder named like the DVD itself and
create a torrent from the folder &quot;Movie-title&quot;.<br>
<br>
There are some ripping programs who create a top folder named DVDVOLUME. Please rename such a folder to the correct
DVD-title. In case there are two uploads with a root folder DVDVOLUME - and you want to download both of them - the
content of your first download will be unavoidably overwritten (same is valid if you upload only the folder VIDEO_TS,
because this folder occurs on each and every DVD and is always named VIDEO_TS<br>
<br>
DVDs should not miss the *.IFO and/or *.BUP files (containing only *.VOB files). <img alt="Updated" border="1px" src="pic/updated.png" /><br>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>I use Vuze / Azureus and it won't allow me to keep seeding</b><a name="#531" id="531"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If Vuze/Azureus doesn't keep seeding try these settings:
(1) Tools > Options > Queue -> Seeding > First Priority > A share ratio under [1:1], set the rest to ignore and uncheck Torrents with 0 Peers
(2) Tools > Options > Queue > Seeding > Ignore Rules > uncheck Ignore torrents with 0 peers
If you see a "scrape error" on torrents stopped or queued, don't worry, that is normal with our tracker having scrape switched off.

<b>When logging into QTM (Quick Torrent Maker), I am instructed to turn off a Cookie Management Program</b><a name="#543" id="543"></a>

<b>Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</b><a name="#36" id="36"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
There may be three reasons for this:<br>
<ol>
<li> The torrent may have been out-of-sync with the site
<a class="altlink" href="rules.php">rules</a>.</li>
<li>The uploader may have deleted it because it was a bad release. A replacement will probably be uploaded to take its place.</li>

<br/>
<b>Do you have straight and bisexual porn?</b><a name="#548" id="548"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, to see them, you need to activate the Straight and Bisexual categories in your profile, since they are by default hidden. Go to your "Profile Settings" and make sure "Straight [_] (Turn off Straight categories)" and "Bisexual [_] (Turn off Bisexual categories)" are <strong>not</strong> checked.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Is there any scat porn?</b><a name="#555" id="555"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, to scat uploads, you need to activate the Scat category in your profile, since it's by default hidden. Go to your "Profile Settings" and make sure "Scat [_] (Turn off Scat category)" is not checked.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I resume a broken download?</b><a name="#37" id="37"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Open the .torrent file. When your client asks you for a location, choose the location of
the existing file(s) and it will resume downloading the torrent.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why do my downloads sometimes stall at 99%</b><a name="#38" id="38"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have pieces you are missing.
That is why downloads sometimes slow down or even stall when there are just a few percent remaining.
Just be patient and you will, sooner or later, get the remaining pieces.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What are these &quot;a piece has failed an hash check&quot; messages?</b><a name="#39" id="39"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Bittorrent clients check the data they receive for integrity. When a piece fails this check it is
automatically re-downloaded. Occasional hash fails are a common occurrence, and you shouldn't worry.<br>
<br>
Some clients have an (advanced) option/preference to 'kick/ban clients that send you bad data' or
similar. It should be turned on, since it makes sure that if a peer repeatedly sends you pieces that
fail the hash check it will be ignored in the future.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The torrent is supposed to be 100MB. How come I downloaded 120MB?</b><a name="#40" id="40"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
See the hash fails topic. If your client receives bad data it will have to redownload it, therefore
the total downloaded may be larger than the torrent size. Make sure the &quot;kick/ban&quot; option is turned on
to minimize the extra downloads.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What is freeleech and how can it help my ratio?</b><a name="#550" id="550"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Seed bonus points can be used to put a torrent on freeleech status for a certain period of time. Our system also periodically selects torrents to add to this list randomly. You can view the freeleech torrent list <a href="browse.php?showsearch=1&infl=1" class="altlink"><span style="color:#FFFF00">HERE</a>.<br>
<br><ul>
<li>Freeleech torrents do NOT count against your ratio (download amountl) as long as it remains on freeleech. </li>
<li>If you seed a freeleech torrent, you will continue to receive upload credit if others download it.</li>
<li>If you are still downloading when a freeleech torrent converts back to regular torrent status, only the portion that remains to be downloaded will count against your ratio.</li>
<li>Users with ratios in gracetime or removed download privileges can still download freeleech torrents, one at a time. By seeding them, you can improve your ratio.</li>
<li>Only torrents that are older than one week can be placed on freeleech.</li>

<br/>
<b>How can I improve my download speed?</b><a name="#45" id="45"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR). Poor download speed is
mainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is low.
<br>
(Proselytising sidenote: make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed.
<b>Seed</b> so that others will not endure the same.)<br>
<br>
There are a couple of things that you can try on your end to improve your speed:
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Do not immediately jump on new torrents</b><a name="#46" id="46"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
In particular, do not do it if you have a slow connection. The best speeds will be found around the half-life of a torrent, when the SLR will be at its highest. (The downside is that you will not be able to seed so much. It's up to you to balance the pros and cons of this.)
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Make yourself connectable</b><a name="#47" id="47"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
See the <i><a href="#14" class="altlink">Why am I listed as not connectable?</a></i> &nbsp;section.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Limit your upload speed</b><a name="#48" id="48"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:<br>
<ul>
<li>Bittorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B
are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate.
So due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.</li>
<li>Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that
it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements - ACKs -, a sort of &quot;got it!&quot; messages).
If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no
bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead
to low download speeds.</li>
</ul>
The full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the
ACKs to get through without delay. <b>A good thumb rule is keeping the upload at about 80% of the theoretical
upload speed.</b> You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you. (Remember that keeping the
upload high has the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.) <br>
<br>
If you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account.
Some clients (e.g. Azureus) limit global upload speed, others (e.g. Shad0w's) do it on a per torrent basis.
Know your client. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp),
always think of the overall upload speed.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Limit the number of simultaneous connections</b><a name="#49" id="49"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Some operating systems (like Windows 9x) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash. Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100 and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of a client running the numbers add up.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Limit the number of simultaneous uploads</b><a name="#50" id="50"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Isn't this the same as above? No. Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to. The ideal number is typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Just give it some time</b><a name="#51" id="51"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
As explained above peers favour other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent you have nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you. This makes the starts slow, in particular if, by change, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon as you have some pieces to share.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?</b><a name="#52" id="52"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Your download speed is always finite. If you are a peer in a fast torrent it will almost certainly saturate your download bandwidth, and your browsing will suffer. You will have to use a third-party solution such as <a class="altlink" href="redir.php?url=http://www.netlimiter.com/" <span style="color:#FFFF00">NetLimiter</a> if your BitTorrent client is not capable of limiting download speed.

<br/>
<i>Caveat: This is a large and complex topic. It is not possible to cover all variations here.</i><br>
<br>
Short reply: change to an ISP that does not force a proxy upon you. If you cannot or do not want to then read on.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>What is a proxy?</b><a name="#55" id="55"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically a middleman. When you are browsing a site through a proxy your requests are sent to the proxy and the proxy
forwards them to the site instead of you connecting directly to the site. There are several classifications
(the terminology is far from standard):
<br>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="100">&nbsp;Transparent</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">A transparent proxy is one that needs no configuration on the clients. It works by automatically redirecting all port 80 traffic to the proxy. (Sometimes used as synonymous for non-anonymous.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Explicit/Voluntary</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">Clients must configure their browsers to use them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Anonymous</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">The proxy sends no client identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header is not sent; the server does not see your IP.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Highly Anonymous</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">The proxy sends no client nor proxy identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, HTTP_VIA and HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION headers are not sent; the server doesn't see your IP and doesn't even know you're using a proxy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Public</td>
<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top">(Self explanatory)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
A transparent proxy may or may not be anonymous, and there are several levels of anonymity.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I find out if I'm behind a (transparent/anonymous) proxy?</b><a name="#56" id="56"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Try <a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://proxyjudge.org" class="altlink">ProxyJudge</a>. It lists the HTTP headers that the server where it is running
received from you. The relevant ones are HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and REMOTE_ADDR.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Why am I listed as not connectable even though I'm not NAT/Firewalled?</b><a name="#57" id="57"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The Gaytorrent.ru tracker is quite smart at finding your real IP, but it does need the proxy to send the HTTP header HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If your ISP's proxy does not then what happens is that the tracker will interpret the proxy's IP address as the client's IP address. So when you login and the tracker tries to connect to your client to see if you are NAT/firewalled it will actually try to connect to the proxy on the port your client reports to be using for incoming connections. Naturally the proxy will not be listening on that port, the connection will fail and the tracker will think you are NAT/firewalled.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Can I bypass my ISP's proxy?</b><a name="#58" id="58"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
If your ISP only allows HTTP traffic through port 80 or blocks the usual proxy ports then you would need to use something
like <a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://www.socks.permeo.com">socks</a> and that is outside the scope of this FAQ.<br>
<br>
The site accepts connections on port 81 besides the usual 80, and using them may be enough to fool some proxies. So the first
thing to try should be connecting to www.Gaytorrent.ru:81. Note that even if this works your bt client will still try
to connect to port 80 unless you edit the announce url in the .torrent file.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you may try the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Choose any public <b>non-anonymous</b> proxy that does <b>not</b> use port 80
(e.g. from <a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://tools.rosinstrument.com/proxy" class="altlink">this</a>,
<a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://www.proxy4free.com/index.html" class="altlink">this</a> or
<a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://www.samair.ru/proxy" class="altlink">this</a> list).</li>
<li>Configure your computer to use that proxy. For Windows XP, do <i>Start</i>, <i>Control Panel</i>, <i>Internet Options</i>,
<i>Connections</i>, <i>LAN Settings</i>, <i>Use a Proxy server</i>, <i>Advanced</i> and type in the IP and port of your chosen
proxy. Or from Internet Explorer use <i>Tools</i>, <i>Internet Options</i>, ...<br></li>
<li>(Facultative) Visit <a href="#999900ir.php?url=http://proxyjudge.org" class="altlink">ProxyJudge</a>. If you see an HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR in
the list followed by your IP then everything should be ok, otherwise choose another proxy and try again.<br></li>
<li>Visit Gaytorrent.ru. Hopefully the tracker will now pickup your real IP (check your profile to make sure).</li>
</ul>
<br>
Notice that now you will be doing all your browsing through a public proxy, which are typically quite slow.
Communications between peers do not use port 80 so their speed will not be affected by this, and should be better than when
you were &quot;unconnectable&quot;.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I make my bittorrent client use a proxy?</b><a name="#59" id="59"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Just configure Windows XP as above. When you configure a proxy for Internet Explorer you're actually configuring a proxy for
all HTTP traffic (thank Microsoft and their &quot;IE as part of the OS policy&quot; ). On the other hand if you use another
browser (Opera/Mozilla/Firefox) and configure a proxy there you'll be configuring a proxy just for that browser. We don't
know of any BT client that allows a proxy to be specified explicitly.

<br/>
Your failure to connect may be due to several reasons.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Maybe my address is blacklisted?</b><a name="#64" id="64"></a>
<br/>
<br/>
The site blocks addresses listed in the (former) <a class="altlink" href="redir.php?url=http://methlabs.org/">PeerGuardian</a>
database, as well as addresses of banned users. This works at Apache/PHP level, it's just a script that
blocks <i>logins</i> from those addresses. It should not stop you from reaching the site. In particular
it does not block lower level protocols, you should be able to ping/traceroute the server even if your
address is blacklisted. If you cannot then the reason for the problem lies elsewhere.
