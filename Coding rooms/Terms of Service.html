The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.</p><p>EXL, Inc. its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, be error-free, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements; or (d) that the Service and/or any content made available through the Service will be accurate or complete.</p><p>EXL assumes no liability or responsibility for any errors, mistakes or inaccuracies of content, any personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of the Service, any unauthorized access to or use of our Service, any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service, any bugs, viruses, Trojan horses or the like which may be transmitted to or through our Service by any third party and/or any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Service and/or any content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.</p><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow for limited liability or exclusion of implied warranties, so not all of the above limitations and/or warranty disclaimers may apply to you.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p><h2>Ability to Accept Terms</h2><p>You must be at least age 13 or older to accept our Terms of Services and thereby, create an Account or use the Services. EXL does not target our Services to individual users under the age of 13. For users under the age of 13, we rely on consent obtained from parents, guardians and/or School, acting as an agent of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of School’s students (altogether “Authorized Representative”) for the use of Services in connection with children under thirteen (13) years of age, if any, through direct email communication via <a href="mailto:hello@codingrooms.com">hello@codingrooms.com</a>. As an Authorized Representative of an user(s) under the age of 13, you represent and warrant that your collection, provision and use of Personal Information through and in connection with the Service does not violate any Applicable Laws or rights of any third party and that you have obtained all requisite consent for monitoring and recording information and communications. Even if not required by Applicable Law, we recommend that you notify all appropriate parties, including parents/legal guardians, teachers, and other appropriate staff about your use of our Services. If we learn of any unauthorized user that is under the age of 13, we will immediately terminate the user’s Account and delete any and all information we may have about that user (unless otherwise required by applicable law). If you have any reason to believe a user is an unauthorized user under the age of 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@codingrooms.com">hello@codingrooms.com</a>.</p><h2>Assignment</h2><p>These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be freely assigned by EXL without restriction.</p><h2>Changes</h2><p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p><p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
