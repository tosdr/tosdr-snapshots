<p>You retain any copyright and other rights that you might hold in any User Content that you post to the Service.

<p><strong>Modification/Termination by ALPHA MEDIA</strong></p>
<p>ALPHA MEDIA respects the intellectual property rights of third parties. Accordingly, you may not store any material on the Service or use ALPHA MEDIA’s systems or servers in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including under U.S. copyright law. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable laws, it is the policy of ALPHA MEDIA to suspend or terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the internet service provided to any subscriber or account holder who is deemed to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers of copyrights. In addition, ALPHA MEDIA expressly reserves the right to suspend, terminate or take other interim action regarding the internet service of any user if ALPHA MEDIA, in its sole discretion, believes that circumstances relating to an infringement of third party intellectual property rights warrant such action. These policies are in addition to and do not affect or modify any other rights ALPHA MEDIA may have under law or contract.</p>
<p>In addition, ALPHA MEDIA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate this Service and/or any portion thereof, and/or your account, password, or use of any ALPHA MEDIA internet service, or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without notice to you.</p>
<p>Any termination of your account removes your authorization to use the Service. In the event of termination, you will still be bound by your obligations under this Agreement, including the warranties made by you, and by the disclaimers and limitations of liability. Additionally, ALPHA MEDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ALPHA MEDIA, its subsidiaries, agents, parent companies, distributors, licensees and affiliates, and their officers, directors and employees from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from your breach of any provision of this Agreement or any warranty you provide herein, or otherwise arising in any way out of your use of this Service and any related ALPHA MEDIA internet service and/or software. ALPHA MEDIA reserves the right to take exclusive control and defense of any such claim otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate fully with ALPHA MEDIA in asserting any available defenses.</p>

If you choose to access this Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.</p>
<p>The United States controls the export of any software downloadable from this Service. No software or any other materials associated with this Service may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries or persons prohibited under export control laws, including but not limited to countries against which the United States has embargoed goods, or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders. You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your local jurisdiction regarding the import, export, or re-export of any such materials. By using and/or downloading any such materials from the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country to which such import, export, or re-export is prohibited or are not a person or entity to which such export is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement and the Privacy Policy shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any cause of action you or ALPHA MEDIA brings to enforce this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy, or in connection with any matters related to this Service and/or an ALPHA MEDIA internet service, shall be brought only in either the state or Federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Oregon for any cause of action arising out of this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy, or in connection with any matters related to this Service and/or an ALPHA MEDIA internet service. You agree to file any cause of action with respect to this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy, or in connection with any matters related to this Service and/or an ALPHA MEDIA internet service, within one year after the cause of action arises. You agree that a cause of action filed after this date is barred.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid or for any reason unenforceable including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement and/or the Privacy Policy shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and ALPHA MEDIA with respect to the use of the Service and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by an authorized representative of ALPHA MEDIA.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p>You agree that all claims or disputes between us will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration. If you or we bring a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of the parties can bring a claim on a class or representative basis. Furthermore, neither you nor we may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or us from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general. We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this section will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and us. This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>You and the ALPHA MEDIA Affiliate that operates the Service agree to try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration. If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify us of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e68f888089a6878a968e878b83828f87939587c885898b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="432a2d252c03222f332b222e26272a223630226d202c2e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> so that we can attempt to resolve it with you. If we do not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration. Neither you nor we may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></p>
<p>You and the ALPHA MEDIA Affiliate that operates the Service agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA’s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA’s rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control. To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9df4f3fbf2ddfcf1edf5fcf0f8f9f4fce8eefcb3fef2f0"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2c45424a436c4d405c444d414948454d595f4d024f4341">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. You must also comply with the AAA’s rules regarding initiation of arbitration. The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location. If you seek less than $10,000, then you may choose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions concerning this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and/or the Service, you may send them by e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#422b2c242d02232e322a232f27262b233731236c212d2f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e881868e87a88984988089858d8c81899d9b89c68b8785">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
