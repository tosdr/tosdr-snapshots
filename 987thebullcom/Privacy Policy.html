</ol>
<p><b><i>Right to Know.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> California residents have the right to request that Alpha disclose what information we have collected, used, disclosed, or sold about you. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request for such information, we may disclose to you, based on your specific request:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  The categories of personal information we collected about you;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  The categories of third-parties with whom we shared your personal information;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients obtained;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  If we sold your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients purchased; or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–  Specific pieces of data</span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Request Deletion</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. California residents have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Correct</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California residents have the right to ask that we correct inaccurate information that we have about you.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information.</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In certain circumstances, California residents have the right to ask that we limit the collection and use of sensitive personal information.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  California residents have the right to direct businesses that sell personal information to not sell your personal information (the “right to opt-out”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use digital technologies, including online identifiers, to provide you with personalized marketing and perform online analytics.  We may disclose these online identifiers to our analytics and marketing partners. The CCPA considers this to be Selling and Sharing of your personal information. Alpha does not have actual knowledge that it Sells or Shares Personal Information about consumers under 16 years of age.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we may share your information with co-sponsors of our contests and promotions, which also could be considered a Sale under the CCPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to opt-out of Selling and Sharing. For more information about these activities and to exercise your right to opt-out of Selling and Sharing, please see our <a href="/notice-of-right-to-opt-out">“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”</a> page, which contains our Notice of the Right to Opt-Out and opt-out mechanism.     </span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Opt-In to Sales of Personal Information for Minors Under 16.</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not sell the personal information of California residents we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13-15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Non-Discrimination</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. California residents have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised the rights established by the CCPA. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may, however, offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. For more information about the CCPA-permitted financial incentives that we offer, see </span><a href="#caincentive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice of Financial Incentive.</span></a></p>

To verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have; however, we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification. We may also use a third-party identity verification service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Notice of Financial Incentive is part of Alpha’s </span><a href="https://www.alphamediausa.com/privacy-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and includes an explanation of financial incentives we offer California residents. This Notice of Financial Incentive applies solely to California residents (“California consumers” or “you”). We adopt this Notice of Financial Incentive in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice of Financial Incentive.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Financial Incentive Offered.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alpha conducts contests and promotions. Listeners who share certain personal information with us—for example, their name and contact information, such as an email address or social media account details—have a chance of to win the contest or promotion. Alpha also offers listeners the opportunity to sign up to receive early access information for certain shows, or participate in similar promotions, by providing personal information such as their name and an email address. Each individual contest, promotion, or early ticket offer is governed by its own terms, and the exact financial incentive offered will be detailed there. Alpha values the data of listeners that participate in our incentives because it allows us to engage with and reward our loyal listeners with promotions and other incentives tailored to their interests and level of engagement with us.  The value of each consumer’s data depends on the listener’s level of engagement with us and our sponsors compared to the level of engagement of listeners that do not participate in our incentives.</span></p>
