          <p class="c0 mb-4">
            <span class="c1">Effective Date: Nov 24, 2020
            </span>
          </p>

          <p class="c22"><span class="c10">The Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Website is a website under which Carnegie Mellon University (&rdquo;CMU&rdquo;) provides part of </span><span class="c5">the Internet of Things privacy infrastructure (&ldquo;IoT privacy infrastructure&rdquo; or &ldquo;IoT PI&rdquo;) created under a research project directed by Prof. Norman Sadeh. The IoT PI enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT devices, IoT services, and IoT apps &nbsp;(collectively referred to as &ldquo;IoT Resources&rdquo;) deployed in a given area</span><span class="c10 c9">, such as a university campus, a building, </span><span class="c10">a shopping </span><span class="c10 c9">&nbsp;mall, a room, a stadium, a city block, an entire neighborhood, or a larger geographical area. The Internet of Things Privacy Infrastructure Project has two components:</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet of Things Assistant (&ldquo;IoTA&rdquo;) mobile app (&ldquo;IoTA Mobile App&rdquo;), which helps users discover IoT Resources deployed in their vicinity by identifying and querying registries of IoT Resources that pertain to the user&rsquo;s current location (&ldquo;IoT Resource Registries&rdquo; or &ldquo;IRRs&rdquo;). The IoTA Mobile App informs the user about the data collection and use practices associated with the IoT Resources it discovers. The IoTA Mobile App also enables users to discover and configure privacy settings that may be offered by IoT Resources (i.e. data deletion, opting in or out of some data collection or sharing practices, or data access requests), and users may receive notifications from the IoTA Mobile App about nearby IoT Resources. </span></p>
          <p class="c1 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c10 c9">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IoT PI website (</span><span class="c10">currently available at </span><span class="c10 c16 c26"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as IoT Portal) which enables people and organizations to inform the public about the presence of IoT Resources deployed in different areas. Using the IoT PI website, individuals and organizations can request the creation of IRRs. &nbsp;Individuals and organizations can also use the IoT PI website to create descriptions of IoT Resources (&ldquo;IoT Resource Listings&rdquo;) and to publish them, enabling mobile users to discover published IoT Resource Listings using their IoTA Mobile App. The IoT PI website also enables users to create partial descriptions of IoT Resources that others could use as a starting point to create IoT Resource Listings (&ldquo;IoT Resource Templates&rdquo;). These IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources.</span></p>
          <p class="c22 c11"><span class="c5 c8"></span></p>
          <p class="c22"><span class="c5 c8">Each IoT Resource Listing includes a description of the data collection and use practices associated with a given IoT Resource, which may include, among other things, what data the Resource collects, how it is used, who it is shared with, for how long the data is retained, etc. More generally, IoT Resource Listings are a way of advertising the presence of IoT Resources in a given area (e.g., advertising the existence of a mobile app that people can download to help them navigate a building, a neighborhood, or a mall; or advertising the presence of a network of surveillance cameras with facial recognition).</span></p>
          <p class="c22"><span class="c10">BY CLICKING &ldquo;Agree,&rdquo; ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE IOT PI, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE (THE &ldquo;</span><span class="font-weight-bold">TOU</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;) ON BEHALF OF YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION TO THE EXTENT YOU ARE ACCESSING THE APPLICATION ON BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION. THESE TOU ARE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT WITH CMU WITH RESPECT TO THE IOT PI . </span></p>
          <p class="c22"><span class="c3">IF THESE TOU ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION, YOU MUST CLICK &quot;Disagree&quot; AND YOU, YOUR ORGANIZATION AND ITS USERS MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE IOT PI.</span></p>
          <p class="c0"><span class="font-weight-bold">Additional Terms. </span><span class="c3">Certain features of the IoT PI may be subject to additional terms (&ldquo;Additional Terms&rdquo;) presented in conjunction with the features. Regardless of how they are presented to you, you must agree to these Additional Terms before using the features of the IoT PI to which they apply. Unless otherwise specified in these Additional Terms, all Additional Terms are incorporated into this Agreement. If you do not agree to these Additional Terms, then you may not use the features to which they relate. This Agreement and Additional Terms apply equally but, if any Additional Term is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement, the Additional Term will prevail for the IoT PI functionality or features to which the Additional Terms apply.</span></p>
          <p class="c0 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c23"><span class="c3">The IoT PI website is being provided by CMU as part of a research study under CMU&rsquo;s IRB ID STUDY2017_00000215 and use of the IoT PI website is further subject to accepting the study consent forms during the account set-up process.</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="font-weight-bold">Account Set-Up; User Account Names and Passwords</span><span class="c10">. A user name and password will be required to access the IoT PI (currently available at </span><span class="c10 c26 c16"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io</a></span><span class="c10">), to request the creation of an IRR, to create </span><span class="c5">IoT Resource Listings, to request the publication of these IoT Resource Listings in one or more IRRs, and to create IoT Resource Templates</span><span class="c10">. People can request the creation of an account at </span><span class="c10 c16"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io/register" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io/register</a></span><span class="c3">. To enable the account set-up, you must provide a user account name for each person at your organization who is intended to access the IoT PI. </span></p>
          <p class="c1 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User accounts can be granted different roles: IRR owners/administrators or IRR contributors, or IoT Resource Template contributors. These roles are all specific to a given IRR. These roles entail different levels of access through the IoT PI. Users agree not to share their user account names and passwords with others.</span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c4 c14">IRR Owners/Administrators:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;To be an IRR owner/administrator, you will first agree to the study consent form provided. You will then need to complete a request form, in which you will provide your name, contact email, organization name and type, and a description of the purpose for which you plan to use each registry you are requesting, including the area it will cover, namely the area where it will be allowed to publicize the presence of IoT Resources. The information you provide may be used in part to vet your request, prevent abuse and to contact you. Once an IRR is created for you by CMU, you automatically become the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the IRR. As owner, you have administrator privileges for the IRR and may also give administrator privileges to other users to the extent they have agreed to the same IRB consent form, the same Terms of Use </span><span class="c10 c25"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io/terms-of-use" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io/terms-of-use</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and acknowledged the Privacy Policy </span><span class="c25 c10"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy</a></span><span class="c5 c8">. IRR owners/administrators have overall responsibility for approving requests to publish IoT Resource Listings in their IRRs and establishing adequate procedures to manage content published in their IRRs.</span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c5">If you are an IRR owner/administrator you agree that you are the (data) controller (</span><span class="c10">as defined under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;)) </span><span class="c5">of information you publicize through the IRRs you own or manage. You agree that you: (i) have </span><span class="c10">provided adequate notice and obtained any necessary consents from data subjects required for personal data collected in connection with an IRR you own or manage, and (ii) abided by any privacy choices (including opt-out preferences) of data subjects relating to the personal data you collect. </span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c4 c14">IRR Contributors</span><span class="c5 c8">: To be an IRR contributor, you will first agree to the study consent form provided. You will need to create an IoT PI user account with a display name and a valid email address. The information you provide may be used in part to vet your contributions, to prevent abuse and to contact you. IRR contributors can enter descriptions of IoT Resource Listings using a form that includes fields such as the location where the IoT Resource will be discoverable and the data it collects. There are two ways to publish IoT Resource Listings: self-publication by IRR contributors and publication in an IRR through publication submissions. For self-publication, each IRR contributor can publish IoT Resource Listings and is responsible for the content of their IoT Resource Listings. For publication in an IRR, publication submissions may be vetted by the corresponding IRR owner/administrator, and different IRR owners/administrators may have different policies. Note that administrators of specific IRRs have the authority to decide whether or not a particular IoT Resource Listing gets published in that IRR, and CMU cannot guarantee that any particular IoT Resource Listing will be published.</span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c5 c8">Once an IoT Resource Listing is published, it will be publicly discoverable through the IoT privacy infrastructure and in particular users using their IoTA Mobile App. Since their contents are not vetted by Registry owner/administrators, self-published IoT Resource Listings may be shown differently from IoT Resource Listings published in an IRR on IoTA Mobile App. IRR contributors are responsible for the descriptions of their IoT Resource Listings. </span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c5 c8">Since the purpose of IoT Resource listings is to provide information to all users of the IoT privacy infrastructure, the display name associated with your user account will be made visible to IoT privacy infrastructure users, including IoTA Mobile App users, who view the IoT Resource Listings you have created and published.</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8">If you are an IRR contributor you agree that you are authorized to share any information you contribute to an IRR. You agree that you will not include personal data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, in contributions you make to an IRR.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c11"><span class="c5 c8"></span></p>
          <p class="c7"><span class="c4 c14">IoT Resource Template Contributors</span><span class="c5">: </span><span class="c10 c9">The IoT PI also enables users to create IoT Resource Templates, which include partial descriptions of IoT Resources. These IoT Resource Templates can be shared with, re-used and edited by others to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources. An </span><span class="c10">IoT Resource Template includes an IoT Resource Template names, an IoT Resource Template description, links to privacy policies and privacy settings. </span><span class="c5">To be an IoT Resource Template contributor, you will first agree to the study consent form provided, the TOU and acknowledge the Privacy Policy </span><span class="c25 c10"><a class="c21" href="https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.iotprivacy.io/privacy-policy</a></span><span class="c5 c8">. You will also need to create an IoT PI user account with a display name and a valid email address. Since the purpose of IoT Resource Templates is to provide partial descriptions of IoT Resources to other IoT PI users and enable these other IoT PI users to re-use and edit these templates to publicize the presence of identical or similar IoT Resources, the display name associated with your user account will be made visible to other IoT PI users who look at the IoT Resource Templates you have created.</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c5">If you are an IoT Resource Template Contributor you agree that you are authorized to share any information you include in the IoT Resource Templates you create. You agree that you will not include personal data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses, in such templates and agree that you responsible for the information you provide in the IoT Resource Templates you create.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="font-weight-bold">Content</span><span class="c10">. &quot;</span><span class="font-weight-bold">Content</span><span class="c10">&rdquo; means all information, data, text, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials accessed, posted and/or transmitted through the IoT PI. &quot;</span><span class="font-weight-bold">User Content</span><span class="c10">&quot; is any Content provided by and/or originating from a user (regardless of whether IRR owner/administrator IRR contributor or IoT Resource Template contributor). &ldquo;</span><span class="font-weight-bold">IoT PI Content</span><span class="c10">&rdquo; is Content provided by and/or originating from the IoT PI.
