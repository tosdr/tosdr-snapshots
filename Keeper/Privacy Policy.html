California Consumers have the following rights under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA):</p><p><strong>Right to Notice:</strong> Under the CCPA, businesses must inform consumers at or before the point of collection what categories of personal information will be collected and the purposes for which these categories will be used.</p><p><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Consumers have the right to request that a business disclose the categories of personal information collected; the categories of sources from which personal information is collected; the business or commercial purpose; the categories of third parties with which the business shares personal information; and the specific pieces of personal information the business holds about a consumer.
</p><p><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> Consumers have the rightâat any timeâto direct businesses that sell personal information about the consumer to third parties to stop this sale, known as the right to opt out.</p><p><strong>Right to Request Deletion:</strong> Consumers also have the right to request deletion of personal information, but only where that information was collected from the consumer.</p><p>
<strong>Right to Equal Services and Prices:</strong> The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers by denying goods or services, charging a different price or rate for goods or services, providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or suggesting that they will do any of these things based upon a consumerâs exercise of any CCPA rights.</p><p>For CCPA related inquiries visit this page: <a href="https://keepersecurity.com/contact.html?t=p&r=CCPA">https://keepersecurity.com/contact.html?t=p&r=CCPA</a></p><h2>KeeperFill<sup>Â®
</sup></h2><p>Keeper Security utilizes a system called KeeperFillÂ® which allows you to autofill login credentials across mobile apps and browsers. When Keeper is preloaded on OEM devices, KeeperFill is automatically enabled to utilize the device's accessibility and input method services to identify mobile apps and websites which require login credentials. As disclosed in the Security Disclosure at <a href="https://keepersecurity.com/security.html">https://keepersecurity.com/security.html</a>, Keeper is a zero-knowledge security platform. As such, Keeper Security cannot access, track or view the activity of KeeperFill or your Keeper records. KeeperFill can be disabled at any time by visiting the accessibility settings screen of your device.</p><h2>Browser Extension</h2><p>
Installation of the Keeper Browser Extension requires explicit permission to read and write login and password data into a user-designated website form fields for the purpose of securely auto-filling credentials from the userâs Keeper Vault. Keeper does not track or store a userâs browsing history or web page usage.</p><h2>Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2><p>
