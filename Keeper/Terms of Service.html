Keeper software is used by millions of people globally to protect and store their passwords and private information. The Software may only be used for lawful purposes and as accordingly, you agree to not misuse Keeper.  When using the Software, you agree: <br/><br/> Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that contains software viruses, trojan horses, worms, files or programs intended to interrupt, destroy, deface or limit the use, access or functionality of the Software.  <br/><br/> Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that is illegal, pornographic, abusive or obscene.  <br/><br/> Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that violates the privacy or intellectual property rights of others.  <br/><br/> Not to &quot;Reverse Engineer&quot;, change, modify, hack, translate, copy, distribute, pledge, assign, transfer, make derivative works, exploit, encumber or crack any portion of the Software. <br/><br/> Unless you are an authorized reseller of the Software, you may not display, copy, reproduce, license or distribute the Software, any component thereof, any documentation provided in connection with the Software, or any content, including but not limited to newsletters distributed to you by Keeper Security in connection with the Software. <br/><br/> Keeper Security, in its sole discretion, may remove content and block user access to any content that it determines to be illegal, threatening, pornographic, abusive, obscene or in violation of another party's intellectual property.</p><h2>Your Master Password</h2><p>
You hereby understand that upon using the Software, you will be required to create a &quot;Master Password.&quot; The Master Password will be used by you and only you.  <br/><br/> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Master Password and Keeper records entered, imported and exported using the Software. Keeper Security has no knowledge of your Master Password and will not ask or be permitted to ask for your Master Password. Keeper Security, will not under any circumstances, have access to your Master Password or the records stored in Keeper.  <br/><br/> You agree to not issue your Master Password to any third parties and shall not, under any circumstances, issue your Master Password to any customer support representative of Keeper Security in the event you contact Keeper Security for Software assistance.

If you lose or forget your Master Password, Keeper Security will not be able to assist you in gaining access to your records since Keeper Security does not have access to or knowledge of your Master Password.  Again, it is imperative to not forget your Master Password since this is required to gain access to your records stored in Keeper.</p><h2>Maintenance of Your Keeper Records</h2><p>
Micro-data and files stored in your Keeper vault are referred to as "Keeper Records."  Keeper Security will maintain an encrypted binary file of your Keeper records on Keeper Security's Cloud Security Vault&trade;, provided that you are a paid-subscriber of the Software. The binary is created when you backup your records and is stored in the event that you need to recover your information due to local system crash, damage, loss or hack attempt that results in the self-destruction of your records.  The Cloud Security Vault is also used to enable seamless synchronization of your records on your devices where Keeper is installed.</p><p>
If your subscription expires and you choose not to renew your subscription within 90 days, Keeper Security reserves the right to delete any Keeper records contained in your account that have files (e.g. documents, photos, videos, etc.) contained in them.  Notice will be sent to you prior to termination based on the email address associated with your Keeper account.  Expired user accounts convert to a Free User account.</p><p>A Free User of the software is permitted to use Keeper on one mobile device without the ability to backup, restore, share or save their records outside of the one mobile device. If the device or data is lost or stolen, a Free User will not be able to restore their records.</p><p>
Free User accounts are allowed to create and store ten (10) records in their Keeper vault.  After this record limit, a Free User will be required to purchase a paid Keeper plan (such as Unlimited, Family, Business or Enterprise).</p><p>Free User accounts are allowed to have up to two (2) vault records that contain Two-Factor TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passcodes) codes. To use more Two-Factor codes within vault records a Free User will be required to purchase a paid Keeper plan (such as Unlimited, Family, Business, or Enterprise).</p><p>
Free User accounts are allowed to upload and store five (5) files in their Keeper vault subject to a maximum storage size of 100MB. After this file limit, a Free User will be required to purchase a paid storage plan.</p><p>If you are a free user who has not utilized the Software within 12 months, Keeper Security reserves the right to terminate and delete your account. Notice will be sent to you prior to termination based on the email address associated with your Keeper account.</p><p>
All users of the Software are required to adopt and maintain the Privacy Policy, which may be modified by Keeper Security from time to time.</p><p>Violation of these responsibilities and restrictions may result in the termination of this Agreement.</p><h2>
