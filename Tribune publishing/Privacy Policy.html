<h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">6.1 Our Use of Online Analytics.</h5>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those provided by Google Analytics, Adobe Omniture, The Trade Desk, and similar providers.  These service providers use the sort of technology described in our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> and <a href="#Cookies&#038;OtherInformationTechnologiesCookies">Section 3.2.3</a> of this Privacy Policy to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by these technologies will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in <a href="#Our_Use_of_Interest_Based_Advertising">Section 6.2</a> and <a href="#Managing_Your_Account_Privacy_Rights_&#038;_Choices">Section 8.1</a> of this Privacy Policy and in our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;" id="#Our_Use_of_Interest_Based_Advertising">6.2 Our Use of Interest-Based Advertising.</h5>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, Personal Information and other information that you provide, such as, your age or gender, your searches, demographic and geographic data, User-Generated Content, and other information that you provide to us. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be based on your interests.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">
Also, third parties, including without limitation those whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may place cookies, web beacons or pixel tags, or other similar tracking technologies (such as mobile ‘SDKs,’ which function like a mobile version of a browser cookie and are embedded in mobile applications) on your computer browser, mobile phone applications, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, including your Personal Information, in order to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and mobile applications; and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Websites, Applications, Platform, and the use of our Services. We also allow other third parties to serve interest-based ads to you via the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services so that interest-based ads may be delivered to you when you are using other websites and mobile applications. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, which may be identified by a service provider for purposes of delivering interest-based advertising on the Services, other websites, and/or mobile applications. We likewise may work with platform providers who serve advertising across devices. For instance, we may want to reach our web-based customers when they are on their mobile devices. This is done, generally, by correlating common attributes (such as IP addresses, other browser or device information or hashed email addresses) across devices, to infer a common identity across multiple channels.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">
The third parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting, as is described below the <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> and in <a href="#What_Are_Your_Rights_&#038;_Choices">Section 8</a> of this Privacy Policy. We do not maintain or control these opt-opt mechanisms, which are provided by non-affiliated third parties. Further, we do not control which third parties choose to participate in these opt-out mechanisms. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<ul class="ul1" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: left;" type="disc">
<li>If you choose to delete or reject cookies on your web browser or device, this could affect certain features or Services that we provide via our Websites and Applications;</li>
<li>These cookie blocking and opt-out mechanisms are unique to your computer, tablet, device, and web browser, which means that you will need to re-implement your cookie blocking our opt-out preferences on each such computer, tablet, device, and web browser that you use;</li>
<li>If you clear or delete your cookies on your device or web browser after opting-out of cookies or configuring our cookie preferences menu to block or reject cookies, this will result in the deletion of the opt-out or blocking cookie on your web browser or device, meaning you will need to opt-out or configure our cookie preferences menu again after clearing or deleting the cookies (this may also apply to “Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information” signals/preferences that you implement via our cookies preferences menu on our Websites); and</li>
<li>After you opt-out of cookies or configure your personalized cookie preferences on our Websites to block/reject cookies, you may continue to receive advertising via our Services, but those ads may be less relevant to you.</li>

<li><strong>Global Privacy Control (GCP)</strong>
<p>Some web browsers and browser extensions support the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> (“GCP”), which can send a signal to the websites you visit that indicates your choice to opt-out of certain types of uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, including sales of your Personal Information.  For users of the Services in certain jurisdictions, when we detect a GCP signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your privacy-related choices that are identified by the GCP signal we detected and the GCP setting you implemented, as required by applicable laws.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Track (DNT)</strong>
<p>Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting that can send a signal to the websites that you visit, which indicates that you do not wish to be tracked by the websites.  However, unlike the GCP signals described above, there is no common understanding of how to interpret such DNT signals as of the “Last Updated Date” of this Privacy Policy.  As such, our Websites and Applications <b>do not</b> respond to web browser DNT signals. However, as is discussed above in this Privacy Policy, you may change the privacy preferences in your web browser to prevent or limit the use of cookies or similar technologies.  To learn more about managing, blocking, and deleting cookies, please refer to our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.

This interest-based advertising often uses your Personal Information (such as your cookies, browsing history, or IP address) to serve you relevant ads via our Services. These third parties that provide the interest-based advertising services and technologies we use on our Services may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting.  We do not maintain or control these opt-out mechanisms, which are provided and controlled by non-affiliated third parties.  Furthermore, we do not control which third parties participate in these opt-out mechanisms.

<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"> <strong>Notice For California Residents</strong></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">
The California Consumer Privacy Act <strong>(“CCPA”)</strong>, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act <strong>(“CPRA”)</strong> (the CPPA and CPRA, collectively the <strong>“California Privacy Laws”</strong>) gives California residents certain rights and choices about how we collect, use, and disclose their Personal Information.

This California Notice applies to information of California residents that constitutes “Personal Information” under the California Privacy Laws to the extent that we handle such California Personal Information in our capacity as a business under the California Privacy Laws.

	This Section 15 of the Privacy Policy describes the privacy-related rights and choices that residents of Utah have, effective December 31, 2023, under the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”).</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Effective December 31, 2023, if you are a Utah resident, the UCPA grants you the privacy-related rights described below.

</ul>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">You will not receive any discriminatory or retaliatory treatment from us for exercising any of the privacy rights granted to you by the UCPA.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">For information about the categories of Personal Information that we collect and use (i.e., process) about Utah residents, the categories of Personal Information that we disclose to third parties, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose Utah residents’ Personal Information, please refer to <a href="#Your_California_Rights">Section 9 (Your California Rights)</a> of this Privacy Policy.

As such, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies, practices, and terms of use and to contact them if you have any questions, concerns, or want to opt-out or limit how they collect or use your Personal Information.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" id="How_Long_Do_We_Retain_Your_Information">18. How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information?</h2>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">We retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfil the purposes for which we collect it (for example, for as long as is necessary to provide you with the Services that you have requested); and (2) satisfy any legal, accounting, contractual, record keeping, or reporting requirements that apply to us.
