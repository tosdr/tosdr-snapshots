	<h1>Terms &amp; Privacy Policy</h1>
	<span class="container">
<p>EyeWire mobilizes an online community of volunteers (&ldquo;EyeWirers&rdquo;) who map neural connections by playing a game of coloring 3D images of the retina. EyeWirers learn about neuroscience, and discuss the implications of their mapping for the visual function of the retina. Data collected from EyeWirers is used to advance neuroscience research, and also to devise better ways for humans and computers to work together to accomplish challenging tasks.  At the same time, EyeWire is committed to preserving the privacy of its members, and fostering a growing community of &ldquo;citizen neuroscientists.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
