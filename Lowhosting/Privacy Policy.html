						The Company reserves the right to temporary or permanent suspend or termination(And delete all datas) of service in the event of non-payment of what is due within the established times. This interruption does not relieve the Underwriter from its liability in connection with the payment of the sums due, increased by legal interest and the credit recovery costs.
						</p>
						<p>
						For some types of dedicated services you cannot request cancellation if there is already an invoice issued for that service, in some special cases you can pay a penalty of EUR 15 to pay for the failure to cancel the service in time.

                        <h3>10. Service Level Agreements (SLA)</h3>

							<p>
							
							we commit to ensuring the following Service levels:<br>
							(a) GE-OPENVZ* Services: <br>
							Monthly availability rate: 97.5%<br>
							(b) All Other Services:<br>
							Monthly availability rate: 99.95%<br>
							“Monthly availability rate” should be understood as: the total number of minutes in the month considered as a deduction made from the number of minutes of unavailability over the month
							concerned. The total is divided by the total number of minutes in the month.<br>
							“Unavailability” should be understood to mean: the loss of access to and inability to reboot the VPS,
							for more than three (3) consecutive minutes from the moment an Incident ticket has been opened by
							the Customer.<br>
							<br>
							The Service level agreements made above are subject to the exclusions below, and on the conditions that in the event of unavailability the Customer shall collaborate with us to reestablish the Service.<br>
							This agreement does not in any way concern the availability of elements that are under the Customer’s control, such as software or applications installed on the VPS and used by the Customer.<br>
							This service level agreement is not applicable in the event that we are unable to perform the technical operations required to check the service state due to the Customer’s configuration of their VPS.<br>
							If we confirms that a VPS is available and in good working order, we are released from the obligation under the SLA. However, in this case, upon the Customer’s request, we agrees to assist them in identifying the cause of the issues found by the Customer. <br>
							If we identify an Unavailability, we complete the diagnostic and works in collaboration with the Customer to reestablish availability. 
							<br><br>
							
							If the service level set out above is not reached, the Customer can request the following credits :<br>
							• Unfulfilled availability rate:<br>
							(a) GE-OPENVZ* Services:<br>
							Credit equal to 10% of the monthly amount paid by the Customer for the month during
							which the components were affected by the Unavailability, if the availability rate
							identified is equal or lower than 97.5%.<br>
							(b) All Other Services:<br>
							Credit equal to 10% of the monthly amount paid by the Customer for the month during
							which the components were affected by the Unavailability, if the availability rate
							identified is equal or lower than 99.5%.<br>
							It is expressly agreed that for the Customer, the aforementioned credits represent a flat-rate
							compensation for any damage resulting from our non-compliance with the relevant service commitments. As a result, the Customer renounces the right to submit any other request, demand
							and/or action. <br>
							If an incident results in our side failing to comply with several commitments in the Service Level Agreement, the credits cannot be accumulated. When credit compensation is applied, it is provided as generously as possible to the Customer. Furthermore, the total accumulated compensation able to be attributed over the course of a month for all incidents combined cannot exceed 100% of the total monthly amount billed to the Customer.<br>
							<br>
							The Customer cannot under any circumstances use this article and request the aforementioned credit compensation in the event of unavailability resulting in full or in part from:
							<ol type="i">
							<li>events or factors outside of the our control including but not limited to cases of force majeure, third parties, downtime or incorrect usage of hardware or software under the Customer’s management (particularly the applications run on the VPS);</li>
							<li>failure on the Customer’s part to fulfil the obligations listed as part of this Contract (in particular, failure to collaborate in resolving the incident); (iii) incorrect or inappropriate usage of the Service by the Customer; </li>
							<li>scheduled maintenance;</li>
							<li>an interruption that falls under the conditions listed in the “Terms and Conditions of Use” article in this document;</li>
							<li>hacking or piracy.</li>

                        <h3>11. Fair usage policy</h3>
							<p>
							Some resources are subject to a fair-usage rule and this means that it is forbidden to abuse, we are very large with quantities and do not set a real limit but when the action of a customer can also create problems for other people in the same node/network this violates the fair use policy.
							<br>
							Except in rare cases we will contact you before taking any action on your service or account and we will ask you for explanations and if the abuse is caused by excessive use of resources (e.g. network bandwidth) and you requires this massive use we will arrange a solution for you.
							<br>
							<br>

                    <p>
                      <strong> a) Navigation data </strong>
                      <br/>
For the proper functioning of our site and the services provided, IT systems and software procedures are required which, during their normal operation, acquire certain personal data, the transmission of which is implicit in the use of internet communication protocols.
These are data that are not collected to be associated with identified subjects, but which by their very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow users to be identified (eg IP addresses).
These data are used only for anonymous statistical information regarding the use of the service and to check its correct functioning and are kept for the period strictly necessary and in any case in compliance with the regulations in force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong> b) Customer data </strong>
                      <br/>


In order to be able to provide the services provided in the contractual agreements, carry out marketing activities and comply with tax obligations and foreseen by current regulations, we will collect the following customer data: Name - Surname - Company name (in case of subject other than private) - Tax code - VAT number (in the case of a subject other than private) - Address - City - Cap - Province - Telephone numbers - Email addresses.
These data will be kept for the purpose of providing the services, as well as for promotional activities and for a period of 10 years starting from the termination of the contractual relationship.
For tax purposes and other legal obligations, the same data will be kept for 10 years, unless the law allows a longer period of storage; long, also due to the maturing of the limitation period for any rights claimed by third parties.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      <strong> c) Supplier data </strong>
                      <br/>
In order to ensure the smooth running of the employment relationship, we need the contact details of the relevant subjects operating within the supplier company (such as names, surnames, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses).
We also need all the data necessary for issuing the invoice, as well as the bank details needed to pay for the services purchased (if it is part of the contractual agreements stipulated).
For the aforementioned purposes the data will be kept for a period of one year starting from the termination of the contractual relationship.
For purposes of a fiscal nature and for other legal obligations, the data will be kept for 10 years, unless the law allows for a longer period of storage; long, also due to the maturing of the limitation period for any rights claimed by third parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong> d) Data related to the registration of domain names </strong>
                      <br/>
For the registration of domain names we will only carry out the strictly necessary treatments and if you do not provide the data it will be impossible to provide the service.
The data provided may be communicated to third parties exclusively for the aforementioned purposes (national and foreign registration authorities).
At the end of the registration of the domain, as provided by each of the relevant Registers, the data provided will be published on the WHOIS (public database that contains all the data of the domain name holders).
These data will be kept for a period of 6 months starting from the deletion of the domain name to which they refer, unless further storage is imposed by order of a judicial or administrative authority.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong> e) Data of third parties provided by the interested party </strong>
                      <br/>
It could happen that you provide the data of third parties to request the assignment of domain names or to differentiate the billing contacts (in case your customer directly pays for the service). In this circumstance you will be the exclusive owner of the processing of the aforementioned data with related legal obligations and responsibilities.
These data will be stored exclusively for tax purposes (invoicing) for a period of 10 years and for a period of 6 months starting from the cancellation of the domain name to which they refer (domain registration for third parties), unless the law requires or allow a longer storage period; long.
