References to the The-Latest.com are to be taken as a reference to <strong>The-Latest Ltd</strong> unless the context otherwise indicates.</p><p>These terms and conditions state the terms on which you are permitted to use the site, what your obligations to The Latest are, and what our obligations and exemptions from liability to you are. As we are a not-for-profit social enterprise, we claim the fullest exemptions permitted by law. As we aim to provide a citizen journalism service of the highest quality, we expect that material that you send to us for publication is the product of your own intellectual endeavours, inoffensive and free from defamatory content, and that you will strive to measure up at all times to the standards to be expected of reasonably competent junior journalists.</p><p>By clicking on the tick box and registering as a user of The-Latest.com, you have indicated that you have read the terms and conditions set out hereafter, that you are over the age of 18 and that you agree to these terms and conditions and any amendments and alterations that may from time-to-time be published on The-Latest.com.</p><p><strong>Amendments from time to time</strong><br />1.Â Â Â Â The-Latest reserves the right to change these terms at any time by posting changes online. You are responsible for regularly reviewing information posted online to obtain timely notice of such changes. Any changes take effect on being posted or upon notification to you by other means such as, without limitation, an e-mail to subscribers.</p><p><strong>Exclusion of liability</strong><br />2.Â Â Â Â Whilst The-Latest endeavours to ensure that the information on this site is correct, no warranty, express or implied, is given as to its accuracy and The-Latest Ltd does not accept any liability for error or omission. You use The-Latest entirely at your own risk.</p><p>3.Â Â Â Â In view of our limited resources, it is necessary that we are relieved of any liability that might otherwise accrue by reason of the contents of our website or any websites or webpages to which you are directed from The-Latest. In accessing the Latest, you agree therefore to hold us completely harmless and free from liability for loss and damage howsoever arising. The-Latest shall not be liable for any losses, whether direct, indirect, consequential, or any damages, whether general, special or exemplary damages or otherwise, suffered by you howsoever caused, whether as a result of breach of this agreement or negligence or negligent misstatement or breach of statutory duty or otherwise howsoever. The following particular examples do not detract from the generality of the foregoing exclusions and are provided so that this agreement can give day-to-day guidance.</p><p>4.Â Â Â Â The-Latest intends to make this site available 24 hours a day, but it shall not be liable under any circumstances if for any reason this site is unavailable at any time or for any period. Access to this site may be suspended temporarily or permanently and without notice.</p><p>5.Â Â Â Â The-Latest does not warrant that this site will be compatible with all hardware and software which you may use. Although we in our discretion may put in place security measures for your protection, we shall not be liable for any damage to, or viruses, trojan horses, worms or other malware that may cause loss to or otherwise affect, any computer equipment, software, data or other property as a result of your access to, use of or browsing of this site or any other site or page to which you are directed or your downloading of any material from this site or any site or page to which you are directed.</p><p>6.Â Â Â Â The-Latest accepts no responsibility for hypertext links which do not exist. Links are provided for your convenience with no warranty, express or implied, for the information provided within them. In the event that a link is not live, you will use your best endeavours to notify The-Latest. No responsibility is taken for the content of the site to which links are made, and you agree to hold The-Latest harmless in respect of any loss or damage that may be sustained as a result of accessing any site to which a hypertext or other link is given, or from which you download any material as a result of clicking through to the site on a hypertext or other link. You agree that the views expressed on any website or page to which a link is made are not those of The-Latest.</p><p><strong>Your indemnity</strong><br />7.Â Â Â Â You agree to indemnify The-Latest for any losses it suffers as a result of any breach by you of the terms of this agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any defamatory content in any article, material or other posting created by you and any infringement of intellectual property rights in any article, material or other posting created by you. You further agree to indemnify The-Latest for any legal costs and fees and disbursements and expenses that The-Latest may incur in defending any claim, whether or not such claim is meritorious, that arise out of or in connection with any article, material or other posting (whether literary, photographic or visual or otherwise) created by you.</p><p><strong>The agreed purposes for which you access The-Latest</strong><br />8.Â Â Â Â If there is any material on the website which you consider to be defamatory, offensive, an invasion of any individualâ€™s privacy or otherwise to infringe any relevant national laws, and wish to notify someone or some entity of such contentions, you agree first and immediately, before making any other notification to any other person or entity, to notify The-Latest of the material which you consider to offend against any laws to permit The-Latest the opportunity to remove or modify such material, or to append clarificatory wording, as appropriate.</p><p>9.Â Â Â Â If any material to which objection is taken relates to you or a person on whose behalf you are acting, then you agree that you or the person on whose behalf you act will be deemed to have consented to such material if you fail to notify The-Latest of your complaint and fail to give The-Latest a proper and reasonable opportunity to address it.
