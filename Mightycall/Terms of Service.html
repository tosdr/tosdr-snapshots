<h3>Fair Use Policy</h3>
<p>The “Unlimited calling” and “Unlimited messaging” (SMS/MMS) features offered under the Subscription Plans are subject to the Fair Use Policy. The Fair Use Policy depends on the Customer’s Subscription Plan. MightyCall’ service plans may not be exploited for any of the prohibited uses, as defined in the Acceptable Use Policy section.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated on the Sales Order or Sales Quote:</p>
<p>(a) Core Plan: Under the “Unlimited calling”, the Customer has a limit of fifteen thousand (15,000) both inbound and outbound voice minutes for each billing month; Under the “Unlimited messaging”, the Customer has a limit of two thousand (2,000) inbound and outbound messages for each billing month.</p>
<p>(b) Pro &amp; Power Plans: “Unlimited calling”, the Customer has a limit of one hundred thousand (100,000) both inbound and outbound voice minutes for each billing month; Under the “Unlimited messaging”, the Customer has a limit of two thousand (2,000) inbound and outbound messages for each billing month. The voice minutes and messages will be calculated on an account level. For example, for a Customer that is on the Pro Plan with 10 active users, the Customer’s limit for calling will be 100,000 voice minutes, and 2,000 messages.</p>
<p>Both voice minutes, and SMS/MMS messages are subject to the terms and restrictions of the Acceptable Use Policy along with any other restrictions described herein: these features may not be used for Trunking or forwarding calls or messages from a MightyCall number to another phone number capable of handling multiple simultaneous call or to a private branch exchange or a key system; the messages feature shall not apply to bulk messages or messages sent via workflow automation and SMS bots. The SMS/MMS feature is a Third Party Service and the quality doesn’t depend on MightyCall.</p>
<p>In the eventyou’re reaching a threshold of plan minutes per applicable Term included in a particular plan type, you will need to deposit a balance on your account at your service management dashboard, or the Service will be suspended. MightyCall reserves the right to add, modify or amend the Fair Use Policy at any time for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If You use SMS/MMS, including both person-to-person and account-to-person conversational messages, sending it to ten-digit US phone numbers, You are required to comply with the MightyCall’ Messaging Policy.</p>
<p><strong id="messagingpolicy">Messaging Policy</strong></p>
<p>MightyCall treats all messaging transmitted via the Service as Application-to-Person (“A2P”) messaging. All A2P messages originating from MightyCall Numbers are subject to this Messaging Policy. You are responsible for any person to which it provides the ability to send messages through MightyCall.</p>
<p><strong>‍Consent/Opt-in Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Prior to sending the first message to each recipient, You must obtain express written consent from the recipient to communicate with them. This consent must be clear and conspicuous.  You must make clear to the recipient that he/she is agreeing to receive the type of messages You plan to send and from whom. Examples of obtaining consent include using a web form where it is clearly explained that a user is opting into SMS messages, or by having them send a message to Your number.</p>
<p>You must adhere to the National Do Not Call Registry and refrain from calling or texting anyone who has registered their number on the Do Not Call Registry.</p>
<p>Consent is limited to the specific use or campaign to which the recipient has consented, and You may not send additional messages about other uses or campaigns unless You have received consent from the recipient for such additional messages. You must keep a record of each consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Failure to ensure opt-in may result in your number or service being blocked or suspended by mobile carriers or MightyCall.</em> <em>MightyCall reserves the right to suspend or close your account if you violate these Terms or this Acceptable Use Policy.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Opt-out Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The initial message You send to a recipient must include the following language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END or QUIT. You must provide recipients with the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, You may deliver one final message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited campaigns</strong></p>
<p>While SMS provides a great way to engage your opted-in customers, there are limitations and restrictions in terms of what types of messages may be sent, and to the content of the messages. The following campaigns are strictly prohibited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, tobacco, or firearms advertisements</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical, vitamin, or other drug advertisements</li>
<li>Cannabis, and prescription medication that cannot legally be sold over-the-counter</li>
<li>Campaigns that may be similar to the above</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: MightyCall is currently unable to offer exceptions to the above prohibited campaigns.  Messages similar in nature may be blocked by MightyCall or the carriers at their discretion without prior notification. This list of content restrictions is not exhaustive, and telecommunications carriers and industry guidelines and standards may change over time.  MightyCall in its sole discretion will determine whether Your campaign is in violation of applicable content guidelines or standards, and may block a campaign or suspend service for violations of these restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited content</strong></p>
<p>The following message content is also strictly prohibited and may result in your service being blocked or suspended by the carriers or MightyCall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages that engage in any illegal activity or otherwise violate our terms of service, including the acceptable use policy;</li>
<li>Messages that engage in or promote, pornographic or adult entertainment, regardless of legality;</li>
<li>Messages that contain text or references to violence, hate speech, or otherwise engaging in threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive or fraudulent behavior;</li>

<li>Messages that contain third-party affiliate/lead generation links;</li>
<li>Messages that contain obfuscated links for the purpose of misleading the reader, or use links contrary to the expectation of the user based on the message text;</li>
<li>Messages that are structured to evade this policy or the policies of carriers (e.g. misspelling, uncommon capitalization, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>MightyCall reserves the right to add to this list at any time or determine messages are prohibited at its discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Carrier fees and account restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Accounts in violation of MightyCall or carrier rules and regulations may be subject to reduced deliverability of messages, additional campaign registration requirements and fees, suspension of service, or termination of service in addition to fines and other penalties passed through MightyCall by the carriers.</p>
<p><strong><em>It is Your responsibility to be aware of any additional restrictions when sending SMS messages, and to adhere to any and all policies related to the recipient number. </em></strong></p>
<h3>Phone Numbers</h3>
<p>MightyCall will provide telephone numbers to be used in connection with the Service or you may port a number to MightyCall for use within the Service (each, a “Number”). In case, you are on a Trial Period, you’ll be granted access to two (2) trial phone numbers. If you would like to make the switch to MightyCall paid Service plan after the trial, you can keep the trial number or port in your existing number. You will be the owner of the Number, obtained from MightyCall, upon registration on the paid version of the Service plan.</p>
<p>MightyCall may permit you to request a specific telephone number. If you request a specific telephone number, MightyCall will attempt to provide you with that number. However, MightyCall cannot guarantee that requested number(s) will be available. You should not order any printed material, such as business cards or stationary and/or incur any promotional or event costs, or otherwise arrange publicity showing a number until that number becomes active in your Service account. MightyCall will not be liable for reimbursement for business cards, stationary, or press releases under any conditions if we are not able to give you a requested number.</p>
<p>A request by you to port your Number from MightyCall to another provider may be deemed a request by you to terminate your account with us. If you decide to port your Number to another service provider, you remain liable to us for any outstanding balances accrued on your account, all of which must be paid before porting your Number out of the Service. Your account must remain active until the port is complete. When the port out is completed you remain responsible for canceling any Services related to such Numbers or Ported Numbers or service charges will continue. If your service is terminated prior to porting, it will result in the loss of the Number and the Number will not be eligible for porting.</p>
<h3>Service Distinctions</h3>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE SERVICE HAS DIFFERENT TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS AND OTHER TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS AS COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICES. THE SERVICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT REGULATORY TREATMENT THAN TRADITIONAL OR WIRELINE PHONE SERVICE. THIS TREATMENT MAY LIMIT OR OTHERWISE AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BEFORE FEDERAL AND/OR STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES. In addition, you acknowledge that the Numbers you obtain from us may not be listed in any telephone directory (except for Numbers ported to us from your local phone company, which may be listed). One of the consequences of this is that a reverse directory lookup of your Number will most likely not reveal your address.</p>
