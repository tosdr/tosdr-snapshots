                                This Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;TOS&rdquo;) is between AddEvent and the Customer as applicable.

                                        <li><span><strong>Changes to Services.</strong> AddEvent continually changes and improves the Services. The Customer’s use of any new features and functionality added to the Services may be subject to additional or different terms relating to such new features and functionality.

AddEvent will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of the suspension or limitation as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action.</span></li>
