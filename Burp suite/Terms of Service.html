Except as expressly set out in the Licence or as permitted by any local law, the Licensee undertakes:&#xA;&#xA;1.2.1. not to use (or allow to be used) the Software, the Documentation for any unlawful purposes, particularly as the Software contains functionality that can be used to attack and compromise computer systems, and the Licensee shall be responsible for all losses, costs, liabilities or other damages incurred by the Licensor in connection with any claim by a third party in connection with a breach by the Licensee of this obligation;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.2. to keep confidential any credentials provided by the Licensor enabling the Licensee to log in to the Licensor&#x27;s server (for the purposes of downloading product builds and licence keys and to perform product activation, to create Extensions (as defined in section 5);&#xA;&#xA;1.2.3. to obtain all necessary authorisations from system owners prior to using the Software or any Burp Apps thereon;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.4. unless agreed by the Licensor not to copy the Software or Documentation except where such copying is incidental to normal use of the Software, or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.5. subject to the provisions of section 5, not to rent, lease, sub-license, loan, translate, merge, adapt, vary or modify the Software or Documentation;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.6. subject to the provisions of section 5, not to make alterations to, or modifications of, the whole or any part of the Software, nor permit the Software or any part of it to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.7. not to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or create derivative works based on, the whole or any part of the Software nor attempt to do any such thing except to the extent that (by virtue of section 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions cannot be prohibited because they are essential for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the Software with another software program, and provided that the information obtained by the Licensee during such activities:&#xA;&#xA;1.2.7.1. is used only for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the Software with another software program; and&#xA;&#xA;1.2.7.2. is not unnecessarily disclosed or communicated without the Licensor&#x27;s prior written consent to any third party; and&#xA;&#xA;1.2.7.3. is not used to create any software which is substantially similar to the Software;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.8. to supervise and control use of the Software and ensure that the Software is used by the Licensee&#x27;s employees and representatives in accordance with the terms of the Licence;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.9. to replace the current version of the Software with any updated or upgraded version or new release provided by the Licensor to the Licensee via its account or the Software, immediately on receipt (and failure to do so may result in the Licensee&#x27;s ineligibility for support pursuant to this Agreement);&#xA;&#xA;1.2.10. to keep all copies of the Software secure and to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of the number of locations of all copies of the Software;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.11. to include the copyright notice of the Licensor on all entire and partial copies the Licensee makes of the Software on any medium;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.12. not to provide or otherwise make available the Software in whole or in part (including but not limited to program listings, object and source program listings, object code and source code), in any form to any person other than the Licensee&#x27;s employees without prior written consent from the Licensor;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.13. unless specifically authorised by the Licensor in writing, not to use the Software as part of an automated service offering to third parties;&#xA;&#xA;1.2.14. not to engage in any activity, practice or conduct which would constitute an offence under sections 1, 2, or 6 of the Bribery Act 2010, if such activity, practice or conduct had been carried out in the UK; and&#xA;&#xA;1.2.15. to be responsible for all liability claims, actions, or causes of action, together with the legal costs of the Licensor in bringing the same, arising by reason of or in any way relating to the Licensee&#x27;s actions or activities of its employees, agents, or contractors under the Licence.&#xA;&#xA;2. SUPPORT&#xA;&#xA;2.1. The downloading of a licence for the Software entitles the Licensee to free product support provided via the Licensor&#x27;s support centre portal on its website at the Licensor&#x27;s sole discretion. Such support will be subject to any support conditions, guidance or FAQs on https://support.portswigger.net/ from time to time.&#xA;&#xA;3. BURP COLLABORATOR&#xA;&#xA;3.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Collaborator which is a component of the Software&#x27;s automated and manual testing tools available in respect of the Burp Suite Enterprise Edition and Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 3 shall only apply in respect of that Software. Burp Collaborator involves the Licensee deploying a system on the public web (the &quot;Collaborator Server&quot;) which acts as the recipient of third-system interactions that may be triggered by payloads that the Software sends to target systems enabling the detection of certain types of vulnerability. A full description of the functionality of Burp Collaborator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.&#xA;&#xA;3.2. The functionality of Burp Collaborator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the Licensee as fully set out in the Documentation. By utilising any features of the Software that may cause interaction with Burp Collaborator, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality and the alternative methods of utilisation of Burp Collaborator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and as a result of such consideration has decided that Burp Collaborator, in the form utilised by it, is suitable and appropriate for use by it. The Licensor considers Burp Collaborator to be efficacious in identifying vulnerabilities of the target website in connection with third-system interactions, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before using the Collaborator Server in any of the alternative manners set out in the Documentation.&#xA;&#xA;3.3. If the Licensee is permitted by the Licensor to use the Burp Collaborator server as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by doing so the Licensee warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended the client to use the Burp Collaborator server in accordance with the terms of the Documentation and the client has instructed the Licensee to use the same having discussed with the Licensee the contents of the Documentation relating thereto.&#xA;&#xA;3.4. The Licensee acknowledges and accepts that by utilising the Burp Collaborator server either on its own behalf or on behalf of a client pursuant to a bespoke consultancy, the Licensor could be a Sub- Processor of its client&#x27;s personal data under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). If the Licensor does act as a Sub-Processor, it shall handle the Licensee or the Licensee&#x27;s client&#x27;s data in accordance with its Privacy Notice and as set out in the Documentation relating to Burp Collaborator.&#xA;&#xA;4. BURP INFILTRATOR&#xA;&#xA;4.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Infiltrator which is a component of the Software for instrumenting deployed applications in order to facilitate testing using the Software in respect of the Burp Suite&#xA;&#xA;Enterprise Edition and Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 4 shall only apply in respect of that Software. Burp Infiltrator involves the Licensee deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator component within the target system which enhances the ability of the Software to detect certain types of vulnerability. A full description of the functionality of Burp Infiltrator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.&#xA;&#xA;4.2. The functionality of Burp Infiltrator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the user as fully set out in the Documentation. By deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator tool, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality of Burp Infiltrator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and any bespoke consultancy clients of the Licensee and, as a result of such consideration, has decided that Burp Infiltrator is suitable and appropriate for use by it and by any client of the Licensee. The Licensor considers Burp Infiltrator to be efficacious in helping to identify vulnerabilities of the target website, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before utilising Burp Infiltrator in the manner set out in the Documentation.&#xA;&#xA;4.3. If the Licensee causes its client to install Burp Infiltrator as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by so doing it warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended to the client to install Burp Infiltrator on its system and has discussed with the client the contents of the Documentation relating thereto and the potential consequences of such installation.&#xA;&#xA;5. EXTENSIONS&#xA;&#xA;5.1. In the Licence Agreement &quot;Extension&quot; means all programming additions made by a Licensee or on his behalf or with his concurrence to the Software using the Burp Extender API (as hereinafter defined) to either:&#xA;&#xA;5.1.1. extend the functionality of the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor; or&#xA;&#xA;5.1.2. enable the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor to inter-operate with other&#xA;&#xA;software;&#xA;&#xA;but not to copy, clone, reproduce or emulate any existing feature of any software produced by the Licensor; and &quot;Burp App&quot; or &quot;BApp&quot; means an Extension adopted by the Licensor pursuant to this clause.&#xA;&#xA;5.2. &quot;Burp Extender API&quot; means the official Burp Extender application programming interface made available by PortSwigger Ltd and further described as part of the Documentation.&#xA;&#xA;5.3. Extensions may be created for the use of the Licensee provided that if any such Extension is published (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include sharing such Extension with another licensee or a third party unless the party to which the Extension is provided is either a client of the Licensee and the relevant Extension has been created for use on an engagement for that or another client of the Licensee, or another Licensee within the Licensee&#x27;s organisation) the Licensee shall notify the Licensor and provide to it a copy of such Extension and the Licensee agrees that any such Extension shall, at the option of the Licensor, become either:&#xA;&#xA;5.3.1. a Burp App; or&#xA;&#xA;5.3.2. part of the Software.&#xA;&#xA;5.4. When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the option, in its sole discretion, to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having carried out such diligence as it deems appropriate, on the Extension.&#xA;&#xA;5.5. The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where Burp Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an Extension.&#xA;&#xA;5.6. All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive licence free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the Software and to use, copy, modify and adapt it for any purpose at the Licensor&#x27;s option and an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use the Extension free of charge to all third party licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.&#xA;&#xA;5.7. If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that effect.&#xA;&#xA;5.8. The Licensor retains the right, without incurring any liability to the Licensee, to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee where the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that it is necessary to do so for operational, security or quality reasons.&#xA;&#xA;6. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE&#xA;&#xA;The Software may make use of third party technology that is provided with the Software. The Licensor may provide certain notices to the Licensee in the Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology. Third party technology will be licensed to the Licensee either under the terms of this License or, if specified in the Documentation, readmes or notice files, under separate terms or as otherwise notified to the Licensor by the Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;7.1. The Licensee acknowledges that all intellectual property rights in the Software and the Documentation anywhere in the world belong to the Licensor, that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to the Licensee, and that the Licensee has no rights in, or to, the Software or the Documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of the Licence.&#xA;&#xA;7.2. The Licensee acknowledges that it has no right to have access to the Software in source code form.&#xA;&#xA;7.3. The integrity of this Software is protected by technical protection measures (TPM) so that the intellectual property rights, including copyright, in the Software of the Licensor are not misappropriated. The Licensee must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in its possession for private or commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.&#xA;&#xA;7.4. The Licensor will defend Licensee against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Licensee by a third party alleging that any Software or services infringe or misappropriate such third party&#x27;s intellectual property rights (a &quot;Third Party IPR Claim&quot;), and will indemnify Licensee from any direct damages, finally awarded against Licensee as a result of, or for amounts paid by Licensee under a settlement approved by Licensor in writing of, a Third Party IPR Claim, provided that, in each case the Licensee:&#xA;&#xA;7.4.1. promptly gives Licensor written notice of the Third Party IPR Claim;&#xA;&#xA;7.4.2. gives the Licensor, at its sole option, the sole control of the defence and settlement of the Third Party IPR Claim; and&#xA;&#xA;7.4.3. gives Licensor all reasonable assistance, at Licensor&#x27;s expense.&#xA;&#xA;If Licensor receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to the Software or services, Licensor may in its discretion and at no cost to Licensee (i) modify the Software or services so that they are no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, (ii) obtain a license for Licensee&#x27;s continued use of the Software or services in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate Licensee&#x27;s subscriptions for such Software or services upon 30 days&#x27; written notice and refund Licensee any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the terminated licence. The above defence and indemnification obligations do not apply if (1) the allegation does not state with specificity that the Software or services are the basis of the Third Party Claim; (2) a Third Party Claim arises from the use or combination of the Software or services or any part thereof with software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by Licensor, if the Software or Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination; (3) a Third Party Claim arises from Software or services for which there is no charge or has been provided on a free trial or community licence basis; or (4) a Third Party Claim arises from the Licensee&#x27;s or a third party&#x27;s materials or application or Licensee&#x27;s breach of this Agreement. This clause provides the Licensor&#x27;s sole liability to, and the Licensee&#x27;s exclusive remedy against, the Licensor for any Third Party IPR Claim.&#xA;&#xA;8. LICENSOR&#x27;S WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;8.1. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software and the Burp Apps are provided &quot;as is&quot; and have not been developed to meet its individual requirements, and that it is therefore the Licensee&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in the Documentation and the facilities and functions of any Burp App meet its requirements.&#xA;&#xA;8.2. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software and the Burp Apps may not be free of bugs or errors, and agree that the existence of minor errors shall not constitute a breach of the Licence.&#xA;&#xA;9. LICENSOR&#x27;S LIABILITY: ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CONDITION&#xA;&#xA;9.1. Nothing in the Licence shall limit or exclude the liability of either party for death or personal injury resulting from negligence, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other liability that cannot be limited by law.&#xA;&#xA;9.2. Subject to section 9.1, the Licensor&#x27;s liability for losses suffered by the Licensee arising out of or in connection with the Licence (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents and subcontractors), whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation or otherwise, shall not include liability for:&#xA;&#xA;9.2.1. loss of turnover, sales or income;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.2. loss of business profits or contracts;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.3. business interruption;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.4. loss of the use of money or anticipated savings;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.5. loss of information;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.6. loss of opportunity, goodwill or reputation;&#xA;&#xA;9.2.7. loss of, damage to or corruption of software or data; or&#xA;&#xA;9.2.8. any indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind howsoever arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise.&#xA;&#xA;9.3. The Licence sets out the full extent of the Licensor&#x27;s obligations and liabilities in respect of the supply of the Software and Burp Apps. In particular, there are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms, express or implied, that are binding on the Licensor except as specifically stated in the Licence. Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of the Software and Burp Apps which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, the Licence, or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.&#xA;&#xA;10. PUBLICITY AND COMMUNICATION&#xA;&#xA;10.1. By entering into the Licence the Licensee agrees that the Licensor may refer to the Licensee as one of its customers internally and in externally published media and, where relevant, the Licensee grants its consent to the use of the Licensee&#x27;s logo(s) for this purpose, unless the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing that the Licensor may not refer to it for such purpose. Any additional disclosure by the Licensor with respect to the Licensee shall be subject to its prior written consent.&#xA;&#xA;10.2.
