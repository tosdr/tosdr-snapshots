    <strong>7. COOKIES POLICY </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7.1 </strong>
    <strong> What Are Cookies</strong>
</p>

<p>
SMG and our service providers use small text files called cookies.    <strong>“</strong><strong>Cookies</strong>” are small computer files sent
    to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's, mobile device’s or
    tablet’s hard drive that contain information about your computer, such as a
    user ID, user settings, browsing history, and activities conducted while
    using the Services. A Cookie typically contains the domain name (internet
    location) from which the Cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the Cookie
    (i.e., when it expires), and a randomly generated unique number or
    identifier. Cookies may be linked to Personal Data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7.2 How We Use Cookies and Data Collection Tools</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cookies help us improve SMG Services by tracking your navigation habits,
    and customizing your experience with SMG Services. This enables us to
    analyze technical and navigational information about SMG Services and helps
    us to detect and prevent fraud.
</p>
<p>
    We also use Cookies and other Data Collection Tools (such as web beacons
and server logs), which we collectively refer to as “    <strong>Data Collection Tools,”</strong> to help improve your experience
    with SMG Services – for example, by remembering you when you come back to
    visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
    SMG Services also may use Data Collection Tools to collect information from
    the device you use to access SMG Services, such as your operating system
    type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the
    language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your
    device is located.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7.3 Your Control of Cookies</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Web browsers allow some control of most Cookies through browser settings.
    Some web browsers (including mobile web browsers) provide settings that
    allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your
    computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device
    identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device.
    Although you are not required to accept SMG’s Cookies or mobile device
    identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all
    features available through SMG Services. In addition, if you reside in a
    jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our
    websites and/or applications, you will have an opportunity to manage your
    cookie preferences on those websites and/or applications; except that
    certain cookies are required to enable the core functionality of such
    websites and applications and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.

    <strong>8. ONLINE ADVERTISING AND DATA COLLECTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.1 Online Advertising. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our advertising management partners use Data Collection Tools on our site
    to enable them to recognize a unique Cookie that has been placed on your
    browser, which in turn enables us and these ad management partners to learn
    which advertisements bring users to the TrumpetRatings. In addition, we and
    our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Tools to track the
    actions of users of the TrumpetRatings, to measure statistics of our
    marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on the TrumpetRatings that
    may be more relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
    We and our ad management partners also may use Data Collection Tools to
    record the actions of users of the TrumpetRatings, to measure statistics of
    our marketing efforts, to deliver advertisements on the TrumpetRatings that
    may be more relevant to individual consumers and to improve the consumer
    experience on the TrumpetRatings.
</p>
<p>
    We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
    of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>Principles</strong>"). This
    means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of
    information about your online activities over time and across third-party
    websites for online interest based advertising purposes. More information
about these Principles can be found    <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/principles/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.2 </strong>
    <strong>Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertisements</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    If you want to "opt out" of receiving online interest-based advertisements,
please follow the instructions at    <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">
        www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
    </a>
    . An "opt-out" Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do
    not want to receive interest-based advertisements. If you delete Cookies on
    your device generally, you will need to opt-out again.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you
    will no longer see advertisements from us or on TrumpetRatings; rather,
    opting out means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on
    your particular interests.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, when you opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements
    through the links above, Data Collection Tools on TrumpetRatings may still
    collect information about your use of TrumpetRatings for any purpose
    permitted under the Principles, including for analytics, fraud prevention
    and any other permitted purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.3</strong>
    <strong>Data Collection by Third Parties</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Please note that certain third parties that we do not control may use Data
    Collection Tools on TrumpetRatings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
    those third parties or their Data Collection Tools.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. MANAGING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong>

<p>
    SMG Services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to
    children who are under the age at which they may provide consent for the
    processing of their Personal Data in any jurisdiction where we operate. We
    do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such persons. If you become

11. <strong>LI</strong><strong>NKS</strong>    <strong> TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES</strong>
</p>
<p>
SMG Services may contain links to third party websites and services (“    <strong>Third Party Services</strong>”) with which SMG has no affiliation.
    A link to any Third Party Service does not mean we endorse it or the
    quality or accuracy of information presented on it. If you decide to visit
    a Third Party Service, you are subject to its privacy practices and not the
    privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

    <strong>12. </strong>
    <strong>INFORMATION</strong>
    <strong> SECURITY</strong>

<p>
    SMG has an information security program that implements technical,
    physical, and organizational measures designed to assist in maintaining the
    security and confidentiality of Personal Data; safeguarding against
    anticipated threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
    Personal Data; and protecting your Personal Data against loss, misuse,
    unauthorized alteration or destruction, and unauthorized access or
    disclosure.
</p>
<p>
    However, whenever Personal Data is processed, there is a risk that such
    data could be lost, misused, modified, hacked, breached, and/or otherwise
    accessed by an unauthorized third party. No system or online transmission
    of data is completely secure. In addition to the technical, physical, and
    organizational measures that SMG has in place to protect your Personal
    Data, you should use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal
    Data. If you believe that your SMG account or any information you provided
    to us is no longer secure, notify our Data Protection Officer immediately
by email at    <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@smg.com">privacyofficer@smg.com</a> or by
    calling 1-800-764-0439 and asking to speak with SMG’s Data Protection
    Officer.

<p>
    SMG controls and operates SMG Services from the United States of America.
    SMG may transfer, store and process your Personal Data in the United
    States, the United Kingdom, Japan, or another location in Asia or in the
    European Union. Note that data protection and privacy laws of the country
    to which your Personal Data is transferred may not be as comprehensive as
    the laws in your country. For example, Personal Data transferred to the
    United States may be subject to lawful access requests by federal and state
    authorities in the United States.
</p>
<p>

    the oversight of the US Federal Trade Commission, and will remain
    responsible for processing of Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with
    the Privacy Shield Principles by third parties to which SMG has transferred
    personal data unless SMG proves it is not in any way responsible for the
    event giving rise to the damage. Any and all such transfers of Personal
    Data outside the EEA shall be in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
    all applicable laws. If you have a complaint about our Privacy Shield
compliance, contact our Data Protection Officer by email at    <a href="mailto:privacy@smg.com">privacyofficer@smg.com</a> or by writing
