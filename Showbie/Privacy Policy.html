<div class="p-pdf_iframe__page">
<div class="textLayer"><span dir="ltr">Showbie can make available certain AI-features based on services </span><span dir="ltr">from sub-processors, which are third party companies that process </span><span dir="ltr">data to help us provide the core services to the school or district </span><span dir="ltr">that contract with Showbie. The AI-features will pertain to </span><span dir="ltr">generating feedback for completed student assignments, based on </span><span dir="ltr">prompts provided by a teacher. Limited personal data concerning </span><span dir="ltr">the teachers use of the features will be processed on behalf of the </span><span dir="ltr">school or district as part of the service. The AI features will not be </span><span dir="ltr">used for grading student work, and student data will not be </span><span dir="ltr">processed by using the features. The school or district will be the </span><span dir="ltr">controller related to such sub-processors processing of personal </span>data in relation to providing the AI-features. Prior to engaging new sub-processors providing AI services, Showbie will notify the school or district in writing, thereby giving the school or district the opportunity to opt-out the use of such services.</div>
</div>
<h4>If you are a Teacher/Administrator:</h4>
<p>We collect and process your name, address, school/institution name, contact details, and payment information to facilitate payment of our Services; for internal and external auditing and to make appropriate financial returns to revenue; to process payment of invoices etc. Our payment system also collects the IP address of users who pay online to facilitate credit card location verification.</p>
<p>Users can log in to our Services directly using the Showbie app/web page or by using certain specified third-party accounts such as Google and Microsoft. We may add other third-party sign-on functionality in the future. By signing on in using a third-party account, we use your name, profile picture (if available), and email address to authenticate your identity and to pre-populate your profile.</p>
<p>Some third-party services, such as Google, give you the option to post or share information about your use of the services to your third-party account. The settings for that kind of sharing are outside of our Services. It’s up to you to check the sharing and privacy settings on any third-party accounts.</p>
<p>The lawful basis for this processing is the Terms of Use you have agreed to, or our legitimate interest in facilitating the provision of the Applications and Services to our customers, including processing payment.</p>
<p>If you input the Personal Data of others into the application, you are responsible for ensuring that you have obtained any permissions or authorizations for any Personal Data of others that you input or send through the Application.</p>
<p>We will communicate with you regarding our Services and your account. We will do this via the internet and via the email address you have provided. You acknowledge that data and information transmitted over the internet is susceptible to error or security breaches.</p>
<p>The lawful basis for this activity is the agreement you have entered into or our legitimate interests in providing you with important information about the Services and your account.</p>
<h4>If you are a Student:</h4>
<p>Showbie collects limited Personal Data from minor students only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie, and only where that student’s school board, educational institution, or teacher has contracted with Showbie to do so. Showbie collects names, usernames, and, optionally, profile pictures. This profile information collected allows students to interact with other teachers, students, and other users from their school or institution as more particularly described below.</p>
<p>(a) <strong>It is the responsibility of our customers, e.g. the school board, educational institution, or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to our collection of such student Personal Data. If you are a minor student, do not upload or send any Personal Data about yourself or other students to Showbie, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services.</strong> If we discover we have the Personal Data of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us Personal Data without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@showbie.com"><strong><u>privacy@showbie.com</u></strong></a>.</p>
<p>(b) Students can sign up to our Services with a username and password. Your teacher may provide you with a class code which grants you access to that teacher’s virtual classroom, and also the ability to view other users’ profiles and contributions to discussions/groups. Students are unable to see the grades of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on the site.</p>
<p>(c) Students should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their Showbie account, including, but not limited to, messages between other students, teachers, and assignment grades.</p>
<p>(d) The Showbie site allows students and teachers to interact, post information, assignments, grades, and other similar information. This information will also form part of the Personal Data of students. However, Showbie is a Data Processor of this Personal Data on behalf of the students’ school board, educational institution or teacher who has contracted with Showbie, and that school board, educational institution, or teacher is the Data Controller.</p>
<p>(e) Showbie conducts a small number of user research interviews to gather constructive feedback from the users of the Showbie services. The feedback is used to improve and develop the services. Before conducting a user research interview we ask for the consent from those we interview, which are mostly teachers or administrators. When conducting the interview, some student data may be processed. This may occur as a natural part of the interview, e.g., if a teacher shares their Showbie interface with us during the interview. Showbie will make every effort to limit the collection of student data in interviews and the scope of the research is never targeted to student data. The incidental processing of student data may include the following: name of the organization, geographic location, age of students, subjects taught, extracurriculars participated in, example student work (uploaded files, annotated documents, comments), student names, student profile pictures, student class enrolment. For the processing of student data as part of the user research interviews, Showbie is the Data Controller.</p>
<p>When Showbie acts as a Data Controller for the purposes set out above, the lawful basis for the processing is the agreement entered into with us, or our legitimate interests in providing the Application and Services through our agreement with your school board, educational institution, teacher, or the like.</p>
<h4>If you are a Parent:</h4>
<p><strong>Parents</strong> can create a Showbie account using their first name, last name, and email address. A parent account allows a parent to log in and access their child’s work. Parents don’t have access to any other student’s work ,nor any shared/group discussion.</p>
<p>When processing Personal Data about parents, our lawful basis is the agreement we have entered into with the parent.</p>
<h4>Information collected as part of our sales and marketing efforts:</h4>
<p>We collect, use and disclose Personal Data of administrative users or teachers for marketing purposes provided it does <strong>not direct advertising to any student users</strong>, and provided that student Personal Data is not used or disclosed. We collect Personal Data relating to administrative users or teachers for relevant product or marketing communications. We will never direct advertising to students or disclose student Personal Data. Users may unsubscribe from marketing notifications at any time.</p>
<p>We collect, aggregate, and anonymize data for system monitoring, quality control, marketing, and product improvement purposes, provided it does not entail processing of any Personal Data of users.</p>
<p>The lawful basis for this activity is legitimate interest in selling and marketing our services when advertising to existing customers and consent when advertising to new and potential customers.</p>

<p>In our capacity as a Data Controller, we rely on trusted third-party service providers such as for internal business operations, account administration, billing, improvement of services, and marketing. In this respect, our trusted third-party service providers may have access to relevant Personal Data in order for them to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Where the customer is located in the EEA and the service provider is located in a country outside the EEA (&#8220;third country&#8221;) this will involve transferring of Personal Data to such third country.</p>
<p>Transfers to Showbie Inc., located in Canada, are covered by the EU Commissions Adequacy Decision (2002/2 EC). Showbie will not transfer Personal Data to third countries that do not offer adequate protection unless appropriate safeguards are established, such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose your Personal Data to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
<li>If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, information held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;</li>
<li>As part of a project with other companies in the Showbie Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. When acting in the role as a Data Processor we are committed to using reasonable efforts in redirecting any access requests received from governmental authorities or to notify the relevant customer about the request, unless we are prevented by law from doing so. In any case, we will challenge any overbroad or inappropriate disclosure and disclose only the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to satisfy an access request.</p>
<h3>How Long do we Keep Hold of Your Information?</h3>
<p>In our capacity as a Data Controller, the time periods for which we retain your data depends on the type of personal data and the purposes for which we use it. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to provide the Services and to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
<p>Showbie will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Services, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>
<p>Our Data Controller customers, on whose behalf we process Personal Data acting as a Data Processor, collect and keep Personal Data. For further information on this, please contact your school’s Showbie Administrator.</p>
