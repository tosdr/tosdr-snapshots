                                you and we agree otherwise.  For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any

                                If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory 
                                relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and we 
                                submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your 
                                total Claims exceed $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request 
                                (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or 
                                telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.

                            Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information 
                            to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party's identity, the claims being asserted, 
                            the factual allegations on which they are based, and proof that the claimant is a party to this Arbitration 
                            Agreement and to these Terms of Use. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or 
                            counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions 
                            for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in 
                            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a 
                            party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Use.

                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Batch Arbitration</span>. To increase the efficiency of 
                                administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 25 or more arbitration demands asserting 
                                the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar 
                                relief are presented for filing by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or 
                                organization(s) to NAM against Advance Local (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the 
                                Mass Filing in batches of 25 demands per batch (if there are fewer than 25 arbitration demands left 
                                over after the initial batching, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one 
                                batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; 
                                (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its 
                                discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, 
                                processed, or adjudicated until the then-active batch of 25 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) 
                                that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by 
                                Advance Local and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a 
                                set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and 
                                adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 25 
                                demands (or less as above), shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or 
                                otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted in accordance with the 
                                applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, conducted. You agree to cooperate in good 
                                faith with Advance Local and NAM to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to 
                                provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by 
                                NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other, 
                                NAM and the arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that NAM or arbitrator believe will 
                                provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this 
                                provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator 
                                appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number 
                                of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules 
                                and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Advance Local otherwise consents in writing, 
                                Advance Local does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or 
                                arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this 
                                subpart (viii). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain 
                                suspended until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.

                                The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement 
                                insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (viii) is 
                                found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration 
                                Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Advance Local shall be entitled to 
                                arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing</span>. The results of 
                            the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators.  
                            Advance Local and the remaining claimants' counsel may strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators, 
                            with the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution 
                            of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Advance Local, the mediator 
                            and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive 
                            methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the 
                            Mediation Period and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Advance Local 
                            or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of 
                            the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Advance Local 
                            nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through 
                            further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the 
                            arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.

For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any \n                                in-person hearings for the arbitration, shall be held in New York City, New York, unless \n                                you and we agree otherwise.\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory \n                                relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and we \n                                submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your \n                                total Claims exceed $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request \n                                (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or \n                                telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.\n                            </p>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information \n                            to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party's identity, the claims being asserted, \n                            the factual allegations on which they are based, and proof that the claimant is a party to this Arbitration \n                            Agreement and to these Terms of Use.

Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted in accordance with the \n                                applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, conducted.

The parties further agree to cooperate with each other, \n                                NAM and the arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that NAM or arbitrator believe will \n                                provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this \n                                provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator \n                                appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number \n                                of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules \n                                and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Advance Local otherwise consents in writing, \n                                Advance Local does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or \n                                arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this \n                                subpart (viii). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain \n                                suspended until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement \n                                insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing.

The results of \n                            the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators.  \n                            Advance Local and the remaining claimants' counsel may strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators, \n                            with the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution \n                            of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Advance Local, the mediator \n                            and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive \n                            methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the \n                            Mediation Period and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Advance Local \n                            or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of \n                            the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Advance Local \n                            nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through \n                            further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the \n                            arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            As indicated above in <a href=\"#legal_2_3\">Section VIII(C)(3)</a>, this Agreement to Arbitrate shall survive any termination of the Agreement, \n                            including any termination of your relationship with us.\n                        </li>\n                    </ol>\n                </li>\n                <li><a id=\"arbitration_3\"></a>RESTRICTIONS ON CLAIMS:\n                    <ol type=\"i\" class=\"i\">\n                        <li>AN ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE FILED\n                            WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE\n                            TO SUCH CLAIM, OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS BARRED AND THE RIGHT TO PURSUE SUCH CLAIM IS\n                            WAIVED.</li>\n                        <li>BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING\n                            A CLASS ACTION IN COURT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION.
