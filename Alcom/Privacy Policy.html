            <h2 class="topics-item"><a id="cookies_top"></a>Our Use of Cookies and Related Technologies</h2>
            <p><span class="underline">Cookies/Local Device Storage</span>. The Service will at times place and/or store code or other types of 
                information and/or software on your device or within your browser, such as cookies, locally shared objects, and HTML5 (collectively, 
                "Local Device Storage"). We and third party business partners may independently or in conjunction use Local Device Storage in connection 
                with the Service in a way that collects personal information for the purposes described in the respective privacy policies, including 
                without limitation to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before on the same or different device and to otherwise 
                control and tailor the display of ads to you based on your perceived preferences by collecting data to track the movements of individual 
                users through the Service and elsewhere on the internet over time and across unaffiliated websites, apps, and devices, as well as to help 
                diagnose problems with servers, to gather broad demographic information, to conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record 
                registration and personalization information, to inform offers that we may make to you,  and to otherwise administer the Service. For 
                example, if you register on any part of the Service and are given the option to save your username and password, we may provide this 
                convenience to you via Local Device Storage.</p>
            <ul class="list-type-2">
                <li><span>You May Disable Local Device Storage</span>. If you do not want Local Device Storage, your device, browser, or the settings menu within an application may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the Service may not function properly.</li>
                <li><span>Tracking Technologies</span>. In addition to Local Device Storage, we and/or our third party business partners may use web beacons, web bugs, internet or pixel tags, clear gifs, digital fingerprinting (aka "Machine Identification") and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the "Tracking Technologies") on the Service, including in our communications with you, such as within e-mail and text messages, in-application push notifications, videos, and throughout your use of the Services. We and our third party business partners use Tracking Technologies to determine which messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful purposes described above for use of Local Device Storage. For additional information see the Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) section below.</li>
                <li><span>Do Not Track (DNT)</span>. Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus as to what DNT means in this context, and since some browsers apply DNT signals by default it does not necessarily reflect our visitors' choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites, we do not alter our practices when the Service receives a DNT signal from a visitor's browser.

            <ul class="list-type-2">
                <li><span>How OBA Works</span>. We and our third party business partners, use Tracking Technologies on the Service for purposes of "online behavioral advertising" (OBA). OBA allows the serving of advertisements tailored to perceived interests inferred by your browsing on the Service and on other sites, applications, destinations, and services, over time and across unaffiliated websites, apps, and services, using the same or a different device. To enable OBA, we and our third party business partners, independently use Tracking Technologies to collect certain information, some of which may be deemed personal information, including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier, online identifier) and geographic location of your device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. Your email address may also be used by us, in coordination with third party audience authentication service providers to enable OBA.</li>
                <li><span>Opt-Out of OBA</span>. If you do not want OBA, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="https://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>, <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>, and/or by clicking the "Ad Choices" icon that appears in advertising served through OBA. Please note that these opt-out options only apply to tracking by third party business partners using cookie-based OBA across this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Service itself. As may be required under applicable law, to opt-out of OBA enabled by use of your email address in coordination with audience authentication providers, visit <a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out">https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out</a>, or see the <a href="#rights_top">Your Privacy Choices and Rights; Submitting Requests Under Applicable Local Laws</a> section below.</li>

                year 2021, by clicking <a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocal_reporting.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Verification</h3> 
            <p>We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify your identify before fulfilling your requests to know, correct, or delete. For 
                example, we may seek to establish your identity to a reasonable or a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching information that you 
                submit alongside your request with information that we have in our records. We may ask you or your authorized agent for supplemental 
                information as needed to establish your identity. Authorized agents may also be required to provide a copy of the consumer's signed 
                permission authorizing the agent to submit requests on the consumerâs behalf under applicable local law.</p>
            <h3>Appeals</h3> 
            <p>You may have a right to appeal a decision we make relating to requests to exercise your rights under applicable local law. To appeal a 
                decision, please contact us our Privacy Policy Coordinator by <a href="mailto:Privacy_inquiry@advance.net">email</a> or as described at the end of this document.</p>
            <p><strong><i>California Online Erasure.</i></strong> California's "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code Â§Â§ 22580-22582, requires 
                operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to 
                request removal of content they post. If you fit that description and posted content on a section of our Service that is directed to 
                California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content by contacting our Privacy 
                Policy Coordinator by <a href="mailto:Privacy_inquiry@advance.net">email</a> or as described at the end of this document. In response to 
                your request, we may elect to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the 
                content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the content.</p>
