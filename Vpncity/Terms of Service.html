At your individual request and at your sole discretion we automatically provide unsupervised and non-monitored data conduit – virtual private network (VPN) connection – for your exclusive use, at your own risk and responsibility.</p><p>These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of VPNCity services, therefore we kindly ask you to carefully read them when visiting VPNCity website, before you register, download, install and use the VPNCity services, which include the VPNCity software, VPNCity mobile applications and any services that VPNCity (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “VPNCity”) provides through our software, application or otherwise (all of which collectively are referred as the “VPNCity Services”).</p><p>Please note that the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and VPNCity. By visiting the website, registering for, installing and/or using the VPNCity Services on any platform or device you agree to be bound by these Terms. It is only under these Terms that VPNCity allows visitors / users (the “users”) to use VPNCity Services. If you do not agree to these Terms or any provisions hereof, please do not install and do not use our software, our mobile application and/or any of our products or services.</p><p>If you are using the VPNCity Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and acknowledging that you have the authority to act on behalf of that organization and commit to these Terms on behalf of that organization.</p><h2>Membership</h2><p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li>1.1 VPNCity Services are transitory digital network communications services, which enhances internet security and privacy. We do not condone any unlawful use of the VPNCity Services. VPNCity Services shall not be used for any criminal, illicit and illegal acts, and you accept and agree not to violate any law of any jurisdiction that you are originating from and any other applicable law. It is your (user’s) responsibility to know and comprehend any and all relevant laws related to any jurisdiction or venue that concerns you, your actions and your use of VPNCity Services.</li><li>1.2. By using VPNCity Services, you agree to the whole VPNCity Terms of Service including all said general provisions incorporated by reference. VPNCity may modify the Terms from time to time. The Terms are binding from the time that they are updated on our website. It is your responsibility to check and read current Terms periodically. The amendment of Terms may be communicated to you by sending an email and/or by publishing the updated Terms on the VPNCity website.</li></ul></p><h2>Promotional Offers</h2><p>We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by VPNCity at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent VPNCity membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device type, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent VPNCity membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to you.</p><h2>Billing and Cancellation</h2><p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><span>3.1. Billing Cycles: VPNCity Services are subscribed on a service period basis. You choose the service period and the payment method yourself when you sign up for the VPNCity Services. The VPNCity app for any platform or operating system supported by VPNCity can be downloaded free of charge. Users will have to purchase a paid subscription from VPNCity to connect to the VPNCity Service, except in the case of a limited free trial or certain coupon offers.</span><br/><br/><span>Your service will automatically be renewed and your chosen payment method will be charged at the end of each service period, repeating the length of the previous service period, unless you decide to cancel your subscription for the VPNCity Services.</span></li><li><span>3.2. Payment Methods: To use the VPNCity service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorise us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</span><br/><br/><span>Only basic payment information is processed through our payment service providers (e.g. Stripe, PayPal, etc.) and payment processing partners authorized to provide services within the respective country.</span></li><li>3.3. Updating your Payment Methods: You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).</li><li><span>3.4. Cancellation: You can cancel your VPNCity membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the VPNCity service through the end of your billing period. </span><br/><br/><span>Payments outside of the 30 day refund policy are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused VPNCity access. To cancel, go to the "My Account" page and click the ‘Change Plan’ button. You will be presented the option to cancel renewal on the next page. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, this is visible on the "My Account" page. If you signed up for VPNCity using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your VPNCity membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the VPNCity service through that third party.</span></li><li><span>3.5. Refunds: If you wish to claim a refund, you can do so within 30 days following your initial purchase of VPNCity Service. We seek your full satisfaction with our services, however we understand that technical issues arise that may result in a refund request. In these instances we would like to troubleshoot an issue you experience first. There are common VPN service configuration issues that may hinder VPNCity service for you and we are able to resolve most of the user issues encountered.</span><br/><br/><span>Subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store are subject to iTunes/App Store refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds if you purchased an app through iTunes/App Store – you will have to contact store support for that. Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards will not be refunded. VPNCity cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers. In this case, refunds are handled according to the terms of service of the reseller from which the product was purchased. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars will be refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).</span><br/><br/><span>To prevent abuse of the VPNCity refund policy, refunds are limited to one refund per 6 month period and any additional request will be denied. Refund requests are only valid for the initial period and will not be approved for recurrent payment periods. No refunds will be given for accounts terminated for violations of these Terms.</span></li><li>3.6. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans: We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.</li></ul></p><h2>Limitations</h2><p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li>4.1. Minors: VPNCity Services may be used by persons aged at least 18 years old.
