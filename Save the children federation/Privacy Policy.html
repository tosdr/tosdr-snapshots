<p><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>

<p>Cookies and how we use them:</p>

<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer, if you agree. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device and to target the content displayed to the user’s interests.</p>

<p>You can find more information about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" title="All About Cookies">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do we use cookies?</strong></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Types of cookies</strong></p>

<p>There are two broad types of cookies - 'first party cookies' and 'third party cookies':</p>

<p>First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognize your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your preferences as you browse the site. Basically, these are our cookies.</p>

<p>Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognize your computer when you visit other web sites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for web site analytics or advertising purposes.</p>

<p>In addition, cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent cookies'. Your computer automatically removes session cookies once you close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your computer until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached. We use both session and persistent cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Categories of cookies we use</strong></p>

<p>1. Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential for the user to move around the website and to use its features, e.g. shopping baskets and e-billing.</p>

<p>2. Performance cookies: These cookies collect information about how the user makes use of the site, e.g. which pages the user visits most. These cookies do not collect information that identifies the user.</p>

<p>3. Functionality cookies: These cookies remember choices made by or attributes of the user and enhance the features and content you experience during your visit to our website, e.g. language, appeals visited or user’s location. This cookie is also used to remember a user's preferences for a font size, or customizable parts of a web page.</p>

<p>4. Marketing cookies: These cookies collect information about the users' browsing habits. This may also include your use of social media sites, e.g. Facebook, etc. or how you interact with our website which then shows you relevant content elsewhere on the internet. NB. These may also be used to choose the advertisements that are displayed to you on our website and other websites.</p>

<p>We have assessed our cookies based on the ICC Cookie Guide. The majority of our cookies fall into the first two categories. However, we also use cookies on our webpages which are in categories 3 and 4.</p>
