						<ul class="list-regular clr-primary">
							<li><span>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any IPQS API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</span></li>
							<li><span>Interfere with, abuse, or disrupt the IPQS APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.</span></li>
							<li><span>Sublicense an IPQS API for use by a third party without prior written consent. Consequently, you will not create an API service that functions substantially the same as the IPQS APIs and offer it for use by third parties without written approval.</span></li>
							<li><span>Use the IPQS APIs to replicate or compete with core products or services offered by IPQualityScore without written approval.</span></li>
							<li><span>Use the IPQS APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the IPQS APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, emergency services, or life support systems).</span></li>

						<p class="big text-bold">17. Premium Plans &amp; Queries</p>
					
						<p>Each lookup of the IPQS Services will consume a query credit from the user's account balance, with the exception of retrieving historical account data. Eligible user accounts have access to free monthly credits to test IPQS Services before making a purchase. IPQS has a right to deny free credits for any reason, including suspected duplicate accounts or abusive users. Query packs and premium plan purchases are final as we allocate server resources based on the current volume of paid plans. Each premium account plan has tiered limits for viewing historic data from past lookups through the user dashboard. While the limits are very generous and most accounts do not exceed these limits, please inform us if you are interested in preserving historic data for a lengthier time period.</p>
						
						<p class="big text-bold">18. Affiliate Program &amp; Referrals</p>
					
						<p>IPQS makes an affiliate program available for all active users of IPQS. New users that sign up through an existing user's unique referral URL, known as &quot;Referrals&quot;, will be tracked against the referring user's account. Both the referral and referring users' account must be in good standing to qualify for earnings through the IPQS affiliate program. Referral earnings shall be defined in the referral program section of the IPQS dashboard. Duplicate or related accounts are not eligible to receive referral earnings. Referral earnings will be paid on a NET 60 payment schedule. IPQS has the right to deny any affiliate earnings for any reason.</p> 
						
						<p class="big text-bold">19. Data Sharing &amp; Data Processing</p>
					
						<p>
							Clients using our service may provide IPQualityScore with transactional or user information, which may include IP addresses, names, email addresses, billing details, phone numbers, and similar user data. This information is processed through our services to detect behavioral intent and analyze the risk profile of transactions and users. This data is used to identify patterns of fraud within our system and improve your IPQS account's personal machine learning algorithms.
						</p>
						<p>
							With the exception of the IPQS opt-in fraudulent data sharing program (Fraud Fusion&trade;), IPQualityScore does <b>NOT</b> sell your personal data or the personal data of your end users. Any data shared with IPQualityScore will be confidential, securely processed, and maintained with industry security standards.
						</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">20. Fraud Fusion&trade; &mdash; Opt-In Fraudulent Data Sharing</p>
						<p>Client agrees that IPQS may use fraudulent data, voluntarily shared through the "Fraud Fusion&trade;" opt-in reporting program, with other clients that consume IPQS data. This data may also be used to improve machine learning algorithms for other IPQS clients. All reported data and its origins shared with IPQS shall be kept anonymous to prevent identification by third parties (including other IPQS clients). Sharing data through the Fraud Fusion&trade; program is not required and is not enabled by default for new accounts. Submitting data through this program requires using a <a href="https://www.ipqualityscore.com/documentation/fraud-reporting/overview">special reporting API endpoint</a>. Client may request deletion of data stored by IPQS at any time. Sharing data through this program is not required.</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">23. Class Action Waiver</p>
						
						<p>IPQS and Client each agree that both parties waive the right to a trial by jury and may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding.

						<p class="big text-bold">24. Severability</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">26. Failure To Enforce</p>

						<p>(1) Each Party hereby warrants that it shall neither, directly or indirectly, pay any commission, remuneration or kickbacks secretively outside the books to the other party or any third party’s employees or officers, or provide any gifts or hospitality, nor reach any arrangement for any the above issues with the other party or any third party’s employees or officers, except for the inexpensive advertising gifts given according to commercial practices.</p>

						<p>(2) Either party breaching the provision of this Article shall be regarded as material breach. The non-breaching Party has the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching party, and reserves the right to take further legal measures. The breaching party shall be responsible for all the losses encountered by the non-breaching party therefrom.</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">28. Reseller Governance</p>
						<p>If Customer purchases any IPQS Services through a Reseller, this Agreement will govern Customer’s use of such Services, but not the payment obligations. In such case, Customer’s payment obligations for such services will be as agreed directly with the Reseller and not IPQS. Customer warrants that it will timely pay to Reseller all amounts related to this Agreement. Customer expressly waives and agrees not to exercise any right it may have to downgrade a subscription or terminate a purchase of the IPQS Services for its convenience, or otherwise cancel an order under any applicable Reseller, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Any disputes related to the payment obligations shall be handled directly between Customer and the Reseller.</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">30. Miscellaneous</p>
					
						<p>In any action to enforce these Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorney fees. Any cause of action brought by you against us or our Affiliates must be instituted with one year after the cause of action arises or be deemed forever waived and barred.</p>
					
						<p>You may not assign your rights and obligations under these Terms of Use to any party, and any purported attempt to do so will be null and void. We may freely assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Use.</p>
					
						<p>In addition to any excuse provided by applicable law, we shall be excused from liability for non-delivery or delay in delivery of products and services available through our site arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable by either party, including but not limited to, labor disturbance, war, fire, accident, pandemics, adverse weather, inability to secure transportation, governmental act or regulation, and other causes or events beyond our reasonable control, whether or not similar to those which are enumerated above.</p>
					
						<p>If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
					
						<p>Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms of Use or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
