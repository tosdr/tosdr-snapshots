							<li><span>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</span></li>
							<li><span>Interfere with, abuse, or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.</span></li>

						</ul>
						<br />
						
						<p class="big text-bold">15. Free Account Limitations</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">16. Premium Plans &amp; Queries</p>
					
						<p>Each lookup through our tools and services will consume a query credit from the user's account balance, with the exception of retrieving historical account data. Eligible user accounts have access to free monthly credits to test our services before making a purchase. IPQS has a right to deny free credits for any reason including suspected duplicate accounts or abusive users. Query packs and premium plan purchases are final as we allocate server resources based on the current volume of paid plans. Each premium account plan has tiered limits for viewing historic data from past lookups through the user dashboard. While the limits are very generous and most accounts do not exceed these limits, please inform us if you are interested in preserving historic data for a lengthier time period.</p>
						
						<p class="big text-bold">17. Affiliate Program &amp; Referrals</p>
					
						<p>New users that sign up through an existing user's unique referral URL, known as &quot;Referrals&quot;, will generate 25% commission up to $500 per sale for an account's first recurring purchase. Both the referral and referring users' account must be in good standing to qualify for earnings through the IPQS affiliate program. Duplicate or related accounts are not eligible to receive referral earnings. Referral earnings will be paid on a NET 60 payment schedule.</p> 
						
						<p class="big text-bold">18. Data Sharing &amp; Data Processing</p>
					
						<p>
							Clients using our service may provide IPQualityScore with transactional or user information, which may include IP addresses, names, email addresses, billing details, phone numbers, and similar user data. This information is processed through our services to detect behavioral intent and analyze the risk profile of transactions and users. This data is used to identify patterns of fraud within our system and improve your IPQS account's personal machine learning algorithms.
						</p>
						<p>
							With the exception of the IPQS opt-in fraudulent data sharing program (Fraud Fusion&trade;), IPQualityScore does <b>NOT</b> sell your personal data or the personal data of your end users. Any data shared with IPQualityScore will be confidential, securely processed, and maintained with industry security standards.
						</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">19. Fraud Fusion&trade; &mdash; Opt-In Fraudulent Data Sharing</p>
						<p>Client agrees that IPQS may use fraudulent data, voluntarily shared through the "Fraud Fusion&trade;" opt-in reporting program, with other clients that consume IPQS data. This data may also be used to improve machine learning algorithms for other IPQS clients. All reported data and its origins shared with IPQS shall be kept anonymous to prevent identification by third parties (including other IPQS clients). Sharing data through the Fraud Fusion&trade; program is not required and is not enabled by default for new accounts. Submitting data through this program requires using a <a href="https://www.ipqualityscore.com/documentation/fraud-reporting/overview">special reporting API endpoint</a>. Client may request deletion of data stored by IPQS at any time. Sharing data through this program is not required.</p>

						<p>(2) Either party breaching the provision of this Article shall be regarded as material breach. The non-breaching Party has the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching party, and reserves the right to take further legal measures. The breaching party shall be responsible for all the losses encountered by the non-breaching party therefrom.</p>

						<p class="big text-bold">26. Signature</p>
