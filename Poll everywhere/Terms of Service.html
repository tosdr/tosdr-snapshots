You can downgrade at any time, but

<li>The polls you create and answers you submit belong to you, but we can show them to people for you according to our various sharing and privacy features. Anything you input to our site must be legal, so no plagiarism, hate speech, profanity, etc.</li>
<li>Don't rip off our stuff. Some completely unethical overseas competitors did, and we were ruthless with them. Seriously.</li>
<li>You aren't allowed to reverse engineer the site, hack it, or programmatically use anything other than the API. Surprise, surprise.</li>
<li>If we get sued because of stuff you did on our service, you're responsible for defending us. This is called indemnification.</li>
<li>We can (and do) change features frequently. We can change our prices.</li>
<li>Please be respectful, and we will do the same. Poll Everywhere reserves the right to refuse service to anyone. We can block you if your use is considered excessive, and will shut you off if your behavior is toxic. But don't worry, out of the millions of Poll Everywhere presenters, we've only had to do this a few times.</li>
<li>
There's no warranty. We do not guarantee uptime, or that the service is bug-free. If you need a Service Level Agreement (SLA), you can

</p>
<p>
(j) Reselling the Service:
You may "resell" the Service by offering a service to third parties that incorporate the Service, provided that (i) your service includes substantial additional value beyond the Service, such that your customers do not purchase your service primarily to gain access to the features and functions of the Service, (ii) you agree to be responsible for the acts and omissions of your customers' use of the Service, to the extent it is part of your service and (iii) you: (1) must purchase separate Accounts for each client, project, or other use; or (2) must subscribe to a Custom Plan if you want to do multi-tenancy in which a single Account or login is to be used with multiple, separate third parties (see plans and pricing for more details). For the avoidance of doubt, you may not use a single Account or login for multiple, separate third party entities if you have not subscribed to a Custom Plan, and any attempt to do so may result in additional charges to your Account and/or termination of your Account, at the discretion of Poll Everywhere.
</p>
<p>
(k) Educational Institution Subscribers:
Subscribers that are educational institutions or any subdivision thereof, such as an entire department (e.g. Department of Political Science or Science Department, etc.) or school (e.g., Business School, School of Engineering or School of Medicine, etc.), but excluding cases in which teachers or professors open an account for a single class, are charged a subscription fee based on the number of individual students that are eligible to be Poll Participants. Therefore, if Subscriber is an educational institution, each individual student who will be a Poll Participant must register under the applicable Subscriber’s account. Each registered student may access and use the Services as a Poll Participant from an unlimited number of devices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber may, on a student-by-student basis, provide students with the option to not register under Subscriber’s account. The parties agree that for each student that elects not to register under Subscriber’s account, one individual student license will be converted to a license that permits the Service to be accessed and used by 1.5 devices. Teachers, professors and their assistants are not required to register in order to be Poll Participants, but may need to register as Authorized Users in order to configure and conduct polls using the Service.
</p>
<p>
In addition, on a case by case basis and with approval from Subscriber’s account manager at Poll Everywhere, Subscriber may conduct polls for one-off events such as conferences, which include an additional number of Poll Participants that are not registered students that is equal to the number of registered students for which Subscriber has purchased a license. Finally, Subscriber may add and/or remove registered students twice each calendar year, in order to account for turnover in the student population.
</p>

<h3>3. SERVICE FEES PAYMENT AND REFUND POLICY</h3>
<p>
(a) Payment Generally; Taxes:
In consideration of the right to access and use the Service, you agree to pay the applicable fees in U.S. dollars ("Service Fees") as indicated on the Site. Service Fees are billed in advance on a monthly basis and are non-refundable. A valid credit card is required for paying the Service Fees. If you sign up for a paid subscription plan, you will be billed immediately for the first month of access to the Service. You will be billed monthly for the applicable Service Fee starting on the 30th day after your Account was initially created. All Service Fees are exclusive of all sales, excise or use taxes, or any levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding taxes on the income of Poll Everywhere. Service Fees are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Site, or by e-mail.
</p>
<p>
(b) Upgrades and Downgrades:
If you elect to upgrade your subscription, you will be billed a prorated amount immediately upon upgrading. For any upgrade, your credit card will be charged the difference between the price of the upgraded plan and the prorated credit left from the old plan, as allocated by the number of days remaining in the Account billing cycle. Your Account will be billed monthly thereafter for the amount of the upgraded plan. For any downgrade, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the amount of the downgraded plan immediately, and your billing cycle will be set to the current date. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your Account. Poll Everywhere does not accept any liability for such loss. You are solely responsible for properly downgrading your Account in order to terminate recurring charges to your credit card. An email or phone request to cancel your Account is not considered termination. You can downgrade your Account to free at any time by clicking on the "Our Plans" link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
(c) No Refunds:
There will be no refunds or credits of Service Fees (i) for partial months of Service access, (ii) as a result of any upgrade or downgrade of the Service, or (iii) for any period of time during which you do not use the Service, but have not cancelled your Account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
