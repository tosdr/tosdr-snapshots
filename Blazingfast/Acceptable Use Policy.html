<p class="grouping text-gray"><strong>Renewals of Services</strong></p>
<p>IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, ALL SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW. We will notify you of your upcoming renewals at least 15 days in advance and unless you submit a cancellation request using the cancellation form in your HostPapa dashboard the services will be renewed at BlazingFast&rsquo;s then current rates using the payment method you have provided to us.

<p class="grouping text-gray"><strong>Cancellation Process</strong></p>
<p>You may terminate a Service at any time by using the web-based cancellation form in the My Services section of your BlazingFast dashboard OR by submitting a ticket or an email to our billing department from an email address of record on your account with the specific rights and privileges to terminate your Services.</p>
<p>You must clearly state the following information:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">1. the specific Service you intend to cancel;</p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">3. any other instructions required by our billing department.</p>
<p>In addition, your REQUEST MUST BE CONFIRMED BY OUR BILLING DEPARTMENT BEFORE YOUR SERVICES ARE ACTUALLY CANCELLED. We will review your request within 3-5 business days and send you an email to notify you that the cancellation has been processed or to request further information.</p>
<p>We require all cancellations to be submitted in accordance with this process in order to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. confirm your identity;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed from our servers if applicable to the Service you are cancelling; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. document the cancellation request.</p>
