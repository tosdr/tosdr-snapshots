<b>Content Ownership</b></p>

content that you distribute through the BakaSHOTS Website is owned by you, and 
you give BakaSHOTS permission to display and distribute said content exclusively 
on the BakaSHOTS Website.</p>
<p>
You may

All

<b>Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</b></p>
<p>
BakaSHOTS 
is protected under Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>
DMCA Title 
II, the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (&quot;OCILLA&quot;), 
creates a safe harbor for online service providers (OSPs, including ISPs) 
against copyright liability if they adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed 
safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to allegedly infringing 
material (or remove such material from their systems) if they receive a 
notification claiming infringement from a copyright holder or the copyright 
holder's agent. OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers 
OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users upon notice from such users 
claiming that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also 
provides for subpoenas to OSPs to provide their users' identity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">
