    <h2>Disclosure and Sharing of Information</h2>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>The HiNow will set or access HiNow cookies on your computer. The HiNow allows those
        companies that publish advertisements on our webpages to set or access cookies on user computers. Other
        companies will use cookies in accordance with their own privacy policies, and cannot access cookies used by the
        HiNow. In performing operations associated with our products and services, the HiNow uses web
        beacons to retrieve cookies from our website.</p>
    <h2>Web Beacons (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>Our webpages include electronic images (known as a "pixel GIF" or a "beacon") that allow the website to calculate
        the number of webpage users or users that have saved a certain cookie. The ways in which the HiNow uses
        beacons include:</p>
    <h2>Beacons used within the HiNow</h2>
    <p>The HiNow uses beacons on the website to calculate the total number of users and to identify registered
        users using saved HiNow cookies. We are able to provide customized webpage services when you are on
        non-hinow.tv websites by saving HiNow cookies.</p>
    <h2>Web beacons are used outside of the HiNow domain</h2>
    <p>The HiNow uses website beacons to collect data for partner websites; relevant data is also used for
        statistical purposes. The HiNow user data recorded by website beacons are compiled and made available to
        our partners as aggregate data for reference purposes. Aggregate data includes information such as user count
        and usage, but does not include any personally identifiable data. When the HiNow places website beacons
        to collect data for our partners, we require our partners to inform users on their privacy policy page that the
        webpage uses website beacons. N.B. This option will only be recorded in your current browser and will not be
        recorded in your user history. Therefore, to completely block the beacon, you must click on the above link on
        all of your computers and browsers.</p>
    <h2>HTML Emails</h2>
    <p>The HiNow typically adds a beacon when sending emails in HTML format (emails containing images) to count
        the number of opened messages. Typically, electronic images are considered to be part of the webpage and,
        including banner ads, can all be used as beacons. Therefore, beacons can be added to all advertisements placed
        by the HiNow. The HiNow tracks certain usage behavior. Information collected from web beacons are
        used to understand how customers use our products, provide more accurate reports and enhance the effectiveness
        of our marketing.</p>
    <h2>Editing Personal Account Information and Preferences</h2>
    <p>At any time, you have the right to edit your HiNow account information and preferences, including whether
        you would like to receive information on the latest products from the HiNow.</p>
    <h2>Security Safeguards</h2>
    <p>Your HiNow account is password protected to ensure the security of your privacy and information. Under
        certain conditions, the HiNow uses the universally accepted SSL encryption system to ensure the security
        of information transfer.</p>
    <h2>Amendments to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>The HiNow periodically makes changes to the privacy policy. If there are significant changes to the
        privacy policy, we will promptly notify users by posting the relevant terms in a prominent position on the
