<p>Sellers must meet eBay&#39;s <a href="/help/selling/seller-levels-performance-standards/seller-levels-performance-standards?id=4080">minimum performance standards</a>. Failure to meet these standards may result in eBay charging sellers additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.</p>

<p>If we believe you are violating this User Agreement or any of our policies, or abusing eBay and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.&nbsp;We may offer a process allowing users to report claimed violations for us to consider and handle through one or more of these options, all in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>If we believe you are violating our policies prohibiting <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">Offers to buy or sell outside of eBay</a>, you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. Also, as provided below in the Fees and Taxes section, if we believe you are violating our policy on <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">buying or selling outside of eBay</a>, you may be charged final value fees.</p>

<p>We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a substantial period of time. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.</p>

<h2 id="section4">4. Policy Enforcement</h2>

<p>When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user&#39;s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers. The foregoing does not limit or impair our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</p>

<h2 id="section5">5. Fees and Taxes</h2>

<p>We charge sellers for the use of our Services. In some cases, where buyers receive supplemental Services such as authentication or storage Services for items in certain categories, we may also charge those buyers for such supplemental Services.</p>

<p>The fees we charge sellers for using our Services to sell goods and services are listed on ourâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4822">Selling fees</a>â¯pages. We may change our selling fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site fourteen (14) days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.</p>

<p>If you are a seller, you are liable for fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context ofâ¯<a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">buying or selling outside of eBay</a>, you may be liable to pay aâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4822#section2">final value fee</a>â¯applicable to that item, even if the item doesn&#39;t sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer.</p>

<p>You as a seller must have a payment method on file when using our selling Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with your use of our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may place restrictions on your account, or the eBay Payments Entities (as defined below) may collect amounts owed in the manner described in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>, andâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/setting-changing-payment-method?id=4124#requirements">late fees will apply</a>. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., c/o Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729.

<p>When listing an item for sale on our Services, you agree to comply with eBay&#39;s <a href="/help/policies/listing-policies/listing-policies?id=4213">Listing policies</a> and <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/selling-practices-policy?id=4346">Selling practices policy</a> and also agree that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You assume full responsibility for the item offered and the accuracy and content of the listing,&nbsp;including listing content created using tools offered by eBay or third parties such as translation, image editing, and generative artificial intelligence tools;</li>
	<li>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). eBay can&#39;t guarantee exact listing duration;</li>
	<li>Your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the listing is ended by you or eBay, in its sole discretion;</li>

	<li>We may revise listings to supplement, remove, or correct information;</li>
	<li>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
	<ul>
		<li>buyer&#39;s location, search query, browsing site, and history;</li>
		<li>item&#39;s location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;</li>
		<li>seller&#39;s history, including listing practices, <a href="/help/buying/resolving-issues-sellers/seller-ratings?id=4023#section2">Detailed Seller Ratings</a>, eBay policy compliance, feedback, and defect rate; and</li>
		<li>number of listings matching the buyer&#39;s query.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer;</li>
	<li>Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services;</li>
	<li>eBay&#39;s <a href="/help/policies/listing-policies/duplicate-listings-policy?id=4255">Duplicate listings policy</a> may also affect whether your listing appears in search results;</li>
	<li>Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered;</li>
	<li>We may provide you with optional information to consider when creating your listings. Such information may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and/or current listings; results may vary for individual listings. You agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers;</li>
	<li>For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold at certain price points, eBay may require the use of certain payment methods, subject to our <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/accepted-payments-policy?id=4269">Payments methods policy</a>. For example, for inventory covered by authentication or storage services, buyer and sellers may be subject to escrow and/or payment handling requirements;</li>
	<li>You will not sell and will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the product is prohibited by law or regulation or if the product poses a health or safety hazard as specified by any governmental agency. eBay has no responsibility or liability for the safety or performance of any product that you list or sell using our Services, including any product that is subject to a recall. You are solely responsible for any non-conformity or defect in, or compliance with any public or private recall of, any product you list or sell using our Services;</li>
	<li>eBay may publish and promote your listings, including related content such as username, product reviews and feedback, in any format and through any channel, including across any eBay Services, our partners, or third-party property or advertising medium;&nbsp;and</li>
	<li>Selling fees do not purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services. We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, including listings, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section7">7. Purchase Conditions</h2>

<p>When buying an item using our Services, you agree to the <a href="/help/policies/rules-policies-buyers/rules-policies-buyers?id=4206">Rules and policies for buyers</a> and that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or offer, buying, or committing to buy;</li>
	<li>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you buy the item, commit to buy the item, your offer for the item is accepted, you have the winning bid for the item, or your bid for the item is otherwise accepted, regardless of when payment is due or received unless the transaction terms state that you are required to pay for the item before a binding contract is formed;</li>
	<li>For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer&#39;s serious expression of interest in buying the seller&#39;s item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller;</li>
	<li>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to you;</li>
	<li>Utah Code Annotated &sect; 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code &sect; 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section8">8. International Buying and Selling; Translation</h2>

<p>Given the nature of eBay&#39;s global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased by, and shipped to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We offer certain programs, tools, and experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. If, as a seller, you do not want your item to be sold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you don&#39;t want to ship to by adjusting your shipping settings as provided in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.</p>

<p>If you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>.</p>

<p>For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. You may adjust these settings as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>. If you list your items with an international shipping option, the appearance of your listings on sites other than the listing site is not guaranteed.

We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>One of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through the eBay International Shipping Program (&quot;EIS&quot;). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel processing, international shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service providers that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program. By listing your item on eBay.com you agree to the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/internationalshippingprogram/seller/terms/" target="_blank">EIS Terms and Conditions<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.&nbsp;If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can opt out of the program by updating your <a href="/help/selling/shipping-items/setting-shipping-options/ebay-international-shipping-program?id=5348#section9">shipping preferences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section13">13. Additional Terms</h2>

<h3><a id="Returns" name="Returns"></a>Returns and cancellations for sellers</h3>

<p>Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our <a href="/help/selling/managing-returns-refunds/managing-returns-refunds?id=4079">returns policy</a>.</p>

<p>When an item is returned or if a transaction is canceled after payment has been completed, eBay may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller&#39;s behalf and charge the seller for the amount of the refund.</p>

<p>Additionally, eBay may charge sellers for the cost of return shipping labels and/or other reasonable fees from sellers when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;</li>
	<li>Returns have been automated;</li>
	<li>The seller fails to send the buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or</li>
	<li>The item is not as described in the listing and is returned in accordance with eBay Money Back Guarantee or other applicable terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>eBay or eBay Payment Entities may invoice sellers for these charges and collect such charges as described in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<p>All seller cancellations of orders must be in accordance with our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/order-cancellation-policy?id=5298">Order cancellation policy</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Cancel_buyers" name="Cancel_buyers"></a>Returns and cancellations for buyers</h3>

<p>Buyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order. Buyers can request to cancel an order on eBay within the time period and as provided in our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/order-cancellation-policy?id=5298">Order cancellation policy</a>, and the seller will have 3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be permitted to return the item if the item isâ¯<a href="/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210">eligible for return</a>.</p>

<p>In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an eBay-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use an eBay-generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the shipping label from the refund owed to you.</p>

<h3><a id="eBay" name="eBay"></a>eBay Money Back Guarantee</h3>

<p>Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there&#39;s a problem with a purchase covered by <a href="/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210">eBay Money Back Guarantee</a>, buyers can get their money back if an item didn&#39;t arrive, is faulty or damaged, or doesn&#39;t match the listing. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.</p>

<p>If you (as seller)&nbsp;choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay or eBay Payments Entities may invoice you in the amount of the reimbursement, or collect the amount of the reimbursement from you as described in theâ¯<a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.

	<li>In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, Anti-Money Laundering (&quot;AML&quot;) compliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with eBay&#39;s internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of eBay or the eBay Payment Entity, or a policy of one of the Payment Entity&#39;s third-party payment services providers;</li>
	<li>eBay, the eBay Payment Entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered by you on our Services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any other transaction on our Services where card information is entered. Such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for future transactions on our Services. At any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card information shall be stored as your default payment method. You may make changes to your default payment method through the payment section in My eBay. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to eBay updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. You will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use. By placing a payment method on file with us, you authorize eBay Payment Entities to charge your payment method(s) for any and all amounts arising from your use of our Services, including charges to recover the proceeds of any fraud perpetrated by you, or charges necessary to recoup amounts refunded to you in error;</li>
	<li>You may seek <a href="#Returns">returns or cancellations</a> on our Services, or file <a href="#eBay">eBay Money Back Guarantee</a> claims on our Services. If you are entitled to a refund, the eBay Payment Entities will issue the refund if the eBay Payment Entities processed the original payment. Refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks;</li>
	<li>You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of the services provided by the eBay Payment Entities. You understand that some third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in connection with managed payments transactions. Failure to abide by third-party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the eBay Payment Entity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions.</li>

<h2 id="section17">17. Indemnity</h2>

<p>You will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of our Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

<h2 id="section18">18. Legal Disputes</h2>

<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this Legal Disputes section, the term &quot;related third parties&quot; includes your and eBay&#39;s respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, eBay&#39;s, and these entities&#39; respective employees and agents.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all claims or disputes at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes section.</strong></p>

<h3>A. Applicable Law</h3>

<p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>

<h3><a id="B. Agreement" name="B. Agreement"></a>B. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>

<p><strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, subject to any exemptions listed in this section.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;) and, to the extent not inconsistent with the FAA, the law of the State of Utah without regard to principles of conflict of laws govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Exemption - Small Claims Court Claims</strong>

	<p>Notwithstanding the parties&#39; agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#39;s jurisdiction and on an individual (non-class) basis only. If a party initiates an arbitration asserting a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, the other party may, in its discretion, require that the arbitration demand be withdrawn and that the claim be filed in small claims court.</p>

	<p>Any dispute about whether a claim falls within any given small claims court&#39;s jurisdiction will be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such jurisdictional dispute, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until the small claims court issues a decision that the claim should proceed in arbitration.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>
	<p><strong>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE GRANTED TO OR AFFECT OTHER USERS.</strong> If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph&#39;s limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 18.C below), subject to your and eBay&#39;s right to appeal the court&#39;s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
	<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide as set forth under Section 18.C below.</p>

	<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and <a href="https://www.icdr.org" target="_blank">www.icdr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.</p>

	<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;), which may be downloaded at <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf" target="_blank">this link<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.</p>

	<p>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration or small claims proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>

	<p>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend remotely, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p>

	<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
	<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 3 of this Agreement (&quot;Arbitration Procedures&quot;), and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration that have been paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s rules.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Severability</strong>
	<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>
	<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&quot;OPT-OUT&quot;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&quot;OPT-OUT NOTICE&quot;). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

<h2>2. About eBay</h2>

<p>eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell, and buy goods and services in various geographic locations using a variety of pricing formats. eBay is not a party to contracts for sale between third-party sellers and buyers, nor is eBay a traditional auctioneer.</p>

<p>Any guidance eBay provides as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. We may help facilitate the resolution of disputes between buyers and sellers through various programs. Unless otherwise expressly provided, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety, or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users&#39; content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>

<p>Sellers must meet eBay&#39;s <a href="/help/selling/seller-levels-performance-standards/seller-levels-performance-standards?id=4080">minimum performance standards</a>. Failure to meet these standards may result in eBay charging sellers additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.</p>

<p>If we believe you are violating this User Agreement or any of our policies, or abusing eBay and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.&nbsp;We may offer a process allowing users to report claimed violations for us to consider and handle through one or more of these options, all in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>If we believe you are violating our policies prohibiting <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">Offers to buy or sell outside of eBay</a>, you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. Also, as provided below in the Fees and Taxes section, if we believe you are violating our policy on <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">buying or selling outside of eBay</a>, you may be charged final value fees.</p>

<p>We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a substantial period of time. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.</p>

<h2>4. Policy Enforcement</h2>

<p>When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user&#39;s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers. The foregoing does not limit or impair our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</p>

<h2>5. Fees and Taxes</h2>

<p>We charge sellers for the use of our Services. In some cases, where buyers receive supplemental Services such as authentication or storage Services for items in certain categories, we may also charge those buyers for such supplemental Services.</p>

<p>The fees we charge sellers for using our Services to sell goods and services are listed on ourâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4822">Selling fees</a>â¯pages. We may change our selling fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site fourteen (14) days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.</p>

<p>If you are a seller, you are liable for fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context ofâ¯<a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">buying or selling outside of eBay</a>, you may be liable to pay aâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4822#section2">final value fee</a>â¯applicable to that item, even if the item doesn&#39;t sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer.</p>

<p>You as a seller must have a payment method on file when using our selling Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with your use of our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may place restrictions on your account, or the eBay Payments Entities (as defined below) may collect amounts owed in the manner described in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>, andâ¯<a href="/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/setting-changing-payment-method?id=4124#requirements">late fees will apply</a>. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., c/o Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729.

	<li>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). eBay can&#39;t guarantee exact listing duration,</li>
	<li>Your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the listing is ended by you or eBay, in its sole discretion,</li>

	<li>We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct information,</li>
	<li>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
	<ul>
		<li>buyer&#39;s location, search query, browsing site, and history;</li>
		<li>item&#39;s location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;</li>
		<li>seller&#39;s history, including listing practices, <a href="/help/buying/resolving-issues-sellers/seller-ratings?id=4023#section2">Detailed Seller Ratings</a>, eBay policy compliance, feedback, and defect rate; and</li>
		<li>number of listings matching the buyer&#39;s query,</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,</li>
	<li>Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services,</li>
	<li>eBay&#39;s <a href="/help/policies/listing-policies/duplicate-listings-policy?id=4255">Duplicate listings policy</a> may also affect whether your listing appears in search results,</li>
	<li>Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered,</li>
	<li>We may provide you with optional information to consider when creating your listings. Such information may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and/or current listings; results may vary for individual listings. You agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers,</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence-based tools may be used to provide you with content; availability and accuracy of these tools and content are not guaranteed,</li>
	<li>For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold at certain price points, eBay may require the use of certain payment methods, subject to our <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/accepted-payments-policy?id=4269">Payments methods policy</a>. For example, for inventory covered by authentication or storage services, buyer and sellers may be subject to escrow and/or payment handling requirements,</li>
	<li>You will not sell and will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the product is prohibited by law or regulation or if the product poses a health or safety hazard as specified by any governmental agency. eBay has no responsibility or liability for the safety or performance of any product that you list or sell using our Services, including any product that is subject to a recall.

We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, including listings, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.</li>
</ul>

	<li>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to you,</li>

<h2>8. International Buying and Selling; Translation</h2>

<p>Given the nature of eBay&#39;s global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased by, and shipped to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We offer certain programs, tools, and experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. If, as a seller, you do not want your item to be sold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you don&#39;t want to ship to by adjusting your shipping settings as provided in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.</p>

<p>If you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>.</p>

<p>For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. You may adjust these settings as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>. If you list your items with an international shipping option, the appearance of your listings on sites other than the listing site is not guaranteed.

We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>One of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through the eBay International Shipping Program (&quot;EIS&quot;). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel processing, international shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service providers that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program. By listing your item on eBay.com you agree to the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/internationalshippingprogram/seller/terms/" target="_blank">EIS Terms and Conditions<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.&nbsp;If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can opt out of the program by updating your <a href="/help/selling/shipping-items/setting-shipping-options/ebay-international-shipping-program?id=5348#section9">shipping preferences</a>.</p>

<h2>13. Additional Terms</h2>

<h3><a id="Returns." name="Returns."></a>Returns and cancellations for sellers</h3>

<p>Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our <a href="/help/selling/managing-returns-refunds/managing-returns-refunds?id=4079">returns policy</a>.</p>

<p>When an item is returned or if a transaction is canceled after payment has been completed, eBay may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller&#39;s behalf and charge the seller for the amount of the refund.</p>

<p>Additionally, eBay may charge sellers for the cost of return shipping labels and/or other reasonable fees from sellers when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;</li>
	<li>Returns have been automated;</li>
	<li>The seller fails to send the buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or</li>
	<li>The item is not as described in the listing and is returned in accordance with eBay Money Back Guarantee or other applicable terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>All seller cancellations of orders must be in accordance with our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/order-cancellation-policy?id=5298">Order cancellation policy</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Cancel_buyers." name="Cancel_buyers."></a>Returns and cancellations for buyers</h3>

Buyers can request to cancel an order on eBay within the time period and as provided in our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/order-cancellation-policy?id=5298">Order cancellation policy</a>, and the seller will have 3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be permitted to return the item if the item isâ¯<a href="/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210">eligible for return</a>.</p>

<p>In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an eBay-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use an eBay-generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the shipping label from the refund owed to you.</p>

<h3><a id="eBay." name="eBay."></a>eBay Money Back Guarantee</h3>

You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.</p>

<p>If you (as seller)&nbsp;choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay or eBay Payments Entities may invoice you in the amount of the reimbursement, or collect the amount of the reimbursement from you as described in theâ¯<a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.

	<li>You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of the services provided by the eBay Payment Entities.

<h2>17. Indemnity</h2>

<p>You will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of our Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

<h2>18. Legal Disputes</h2>

<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this Legal Disputes section, the term &quot;related third parties&quot; includes your and eBay&#39;s respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, eBay&#39;s, and these entities&#39; respective employees and agents.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all claims or disputes at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes section.</strong></p>

<h3>A. Applicable Law</h3>

<p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>

<h3><a id="B. Agreement." name="B. Agreement."></a>B. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>

<p><strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, subject to any exemptions listed in this section.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;) and, to the extent not inconsistent with the FAA, the law of the State of Utah without regard to principles of conflict of laws govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Exemption - Small Claims Court Claims</strong>

	<p>Notwithstanding the parties&#39; agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#39;s jurisdiction and on an individual (non-class) basis only. If a party initiates an arbitration asserting a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, the other party may, in its discretion, require that the arbitration demand be withdrawn and that the claim be filed in small claims court.</p>

	<p>Any dispute about whether a claim falls within any given small claims court&#39;s jurisdiction will be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such jurisdictional dispute, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until the small claims court issues a decision that the claim should proceed in arbitration.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>
	<p><strong>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE GRANTED TO OR AFFECT OTHER USERS.</strong> If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph&#39;s limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 18.C below), subject to your and eBay&#39;s right to appeal the court&#39;s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
	<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide as set forth under Section 18.C below.</p>

	<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and <a href="https://www.icdr.org" target="_blank">www.icdr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.</p>

	<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;), which may be downloaded at <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf" target="_blank">this link<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.</p>

	<p>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration or small claims proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>

	<p>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend remotely, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p>

	<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
	<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 3 of this Agreement (&quot;Arbitration Procedures&quot;), and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration that have been paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s rules.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Severability</strong>
	<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>
	<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&quot;OPT-OUT&quot;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&quot;OPT-OUT NOTICE&quot;).

Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration.

Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.

Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.
