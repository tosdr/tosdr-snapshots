    <p>WiseGeek takes the privacy of our visitors very seriously. WiseGeek does not share the information it collects, whether general or personal, in any specific way with third parties without visitor consent or as otherwise required by law.</p>
    
    
  
    
    
    <p>WiseGeek may collect (1) personal or (2) general visitor-related information:</p>
    
    
  
    
    
    <h3 id="3102wbdul7wgc8oow8o0w4gk0">(1) Personal Information Including Email Addresses</h3>
    
    
  
    
    
    <p>WiseGeek will never sell, lease or share personal information, including names and email addresses, with any third party.</p>
    
    
  
    
    
    <p>Visitors will not be required to provide personal information for ordinary use of the site. Visitors may have the opportunity to provide WiseGeek with their personal information in response to specific services or tasks (e.g., signing up for WiseGeek's newsletter). In order to receive additional services, visitors may be required to provide personal information such as names and email addresses.</p>
    
    
  
    
    
    <h3 id="ef7wdc8qj94wgow88kg4w8s48">(2) General Information</h3>
    
    
  
    
    
    <p>Like many other web sites, WiseGeek tracks general information tied to our visitors to enhance our visitors’ experiences by analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user’s movement around the site, and gathering demographic information. This information that is tracked, also referred to as log files, includes but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), access times, referring web sites, exit pages, and click activity. This information that is tracked does not identify a visitor personally (e.g., by name).</p>
    
    
  
    
    
    <p>One way WiseGeek collects this general information is through cookies, a small text file with a unique identifying string of characters. Cookies help WiseGeek store information about visitors’ preferences, record user-specific information about the pages users access, and customize web content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends through their browser.</p>
