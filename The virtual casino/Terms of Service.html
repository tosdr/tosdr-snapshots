This means that the Player must wager $200 X 30 = $6,000 before requesting a withdrawal from their account.</p>

<p>An inactive Virtual Account is an account that has not been used within a 2-year period. Virtual reserves the right to delete an inactive Virtual Account and its activity and data if you are inactive across Virtual for at least two years.</p>
<p>Virtual also reserves the right to delete data in a product if you are inactive in that product for at least two years. This is determined based on each product&rsquo;s inactivity policies.</p>
<p><strong>How Virtual defines activity</strong></p>
<p>A Virtual Account that is in use is considered active. The activity might include these actions you take when you sign in or while you&rsquo;re signed in to your Virtual Account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the Virtual Lobby</li>
<li>Play a game at Virtual</li>
<li>Make a deposit at Virtual</li>

<li>Wagers placed in Roulette, Craps, Pai Gow Poker, Baccarat, War, Sic Bo, and 'Shooting games' -e.g. Fish Catch are not allowed with any No Deposit Bonus (unless specifically stated otherwise) and, do not count towards meeting the wagering requirements.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise stated, the maximum withdrawal amount from any No Deposit Bonus is 1 times the face value of the bonus, with a minimum of $50. All free chips valued below $50 will come with a cashout limit of no more than, nor less than, $50.</li>

<li>Once the Player has completed play with the No Deposit Bonus, whether by requesting a withdrawal (with any excess winnings above the maximum allowed cash-out being removed) or by your total balance reaching below $1, we will credit the amount of your deposit back into your casino account along with whatever deposit bonus you would like.</li>
