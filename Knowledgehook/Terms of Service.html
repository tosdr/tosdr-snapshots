<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>‍</p>
<p>Our mission at Knowledgehook is to help engage students with math practice and offer support to teachers and parents/guardians to improve their student or child’s mastery of math.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY KNOWLEDGEHOOK INC., (“KNOWLEDGEHOOK” OR “WE” OR “US”). THIS IS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND KNOWLEDGEHOOK. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND A PARTY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. IF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Agreement. If you don’t get your parent or guardian to read and agree to the Agreement, you don’t have permission to use the Service.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Terms of Use</h3>
<p>Welcome to Knowledgehook. Please continue reading to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern your use of Knowledgehook’s website(s) and all other products, services and applications made available by Knowledgehook from time to time (such as, Knowledgehook’s iOS and Android mobile applications, email and the Knowledgehook services available on SMS) (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement includes the terms in this document, as well as <a href="privacy-policy.html">Knowledgehook’s Privacy Policy</a> , and Copyright Dispute Policy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</strong></p>
<p>Before using Knowledgehook, you need to be at least 18 years old, and agree to these terms. If you’re under 18, a parent, guardian, or teacher needs to agree to these terms for you. By signing up with Knowledgehook, you agree to these terms.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Using the Service</h3>
<p>You represent and warrant to Knowledgehook that: (i) you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent, guardian, or teacher’s permission to use the Services, and that your parent, guardian, or teacher has read and agreed to this Agreement on your behalf); (ii) all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (iv) if you’re agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection and use of and access to the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</strong></p>
<p>By signing up for Knowledgehook, you agree to post truthful and up-to-date information about yourself or your organization. You must be 18-years-old to agree to the Terms, or have a parent, guardian, or teacher agree to them for you.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Will these Terms Ever Change</h3>
<p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this Agreement may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services, sending you a notice via email, and/or by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services, at any time. We’ll do our best to provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</strong></p>
<p>We want to continually improve the Knowledgehook experience for you, so our terms may change from time to time. We will do everything we reasonably can to update you about these changes ahead of time. Before continuing to use Knowledgehook, it will be important to re-review and agree to any changes.</p>
<p>Again, any changes in policy will reflect our mission to make math practice more engaging while respecting privacy principles.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read our Privacy Policy for more information on how we handle privacy and your data.</p>

</ul>
<p>If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 18 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 18 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 18 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#285b5d5858475a5c684346475f444d4c4f4d40474743064b4745"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2a1a7a2a2bda0a692b9bcbda5beb7b6b5b7babdbdb9fcb1bdbf">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>

<p><strong>WHAT THIS IS SAYING</strong></p>

<h4>Subscription</h4>
<p>Your Knowledgehook subscription will continue until terminated. When purchasing a subscription, you must provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time. If we do not receive payment from your Payment Method, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. Should your Payment Method be denied, we reserve the right to recharge the credit card or payment method for any outstanding amounts. You will not be charged more than the amount of the fees for the Service(s) you have purchased. Unless you cancel your subscription before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method.<br><br>We may offer some promotional trials or time-limited discounts for certain Services from time to time.

<li>Tutoring sessions will be recorded for both safety and training purposes.</li>
<li>All of Knowledgehook’s instructors/tutors undergo background checks and training. However, if a parent develops safety concerns regarding an instructor/tutor’s interaction with a student, they should immediately terminate the session and notify Knowledgehook of their concerns via email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0b3b5b0b0afb2b480abaeafb7aca5a4a7a5a8afafabeea3afad"><strong><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="61121411110e1315210a0f0e160d04050604090e0e0a4f020e0c">[email&#160;protected]</span></strong></a>.</li>
<li>The student is not permitted to communicate with the instructor/tutor outside of the scheduled online session. Any communication outside of the scheduled session must occur between the parent and the instructor/tutor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>OVERALL:</h4>
<ul role="list">
<li>We conduct rigorous screening of and training for all of our instructors/tutors to ensure that each student is being taught by the brightest and most skillful instructors available. While the vast majority of our students see improvements in their marks, we make no guarantees with respect to individual performance.</li>
<li>No parent or student who has engaged a tutor through Knowledgehook is permitted to hire or engage their tutor directly for a duration of 5 years from the date of commencement of the first contract.</li>
</ul>
