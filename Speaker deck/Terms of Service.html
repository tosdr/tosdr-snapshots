If we provide a discount for the first subscription period, you must pay the discounted fee; in any renewal, you must pay the full fee.
		<p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, Self-Serve subscribers who purchase plans directly from Speaker Deck may cancel and receive a pro-rated refund of their initial purchase within thirty (30) days after purchasing an annual plan and five (5) days after purchasing a monthly plan. Our refund policy does not apply to:

		<p><strong>How to Cancel Renewal:</strong> Self-Serve subscribers may cancel automatic renewal in their Billing Settings. Any cancellation or notice of non-renewal will not affect the current subscription period. Speaker Deck may decline renewals.
		<p><strong>Lapse Policy:</strong> When a subscription ends, the account will, at Speaker Deck&rsquo;s option, revert to a free membership or be deleted. Any content in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your content. Speaker Deck is not responsible for the loss of any content. We may publish additional guidelines regarding the treatment of lapsed subscriptions. These guidelines describe current practices only and do not require Speaker Deck to provide any level of post-subscription account status.
		<p><strong>Resale:</strong> You may not sell, resell, rent, lease, or distribute any plan or any other aspect of our Services to any third party unless authorized by us in writing.
