                  <li>
                        World Anvil subscriptions are non-refundable. They are considered "used at point of purchase".
                        <br>
                        That said, we are a small team and we care deeply about our community. If there are genuine extenuating circumstances in your case, please contact us, and we will do our best to help you out.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Why do we do that</strong><br>
                        Refunds incur significant charges to us in transaction fees and handling charges from our subscription service.
                  </li>
                                    <li>World Anvil is obliged by law to provide refunds for purchases only if said purchase has been done illegally.</li>
                  <ol>
                        <li>As a digital product a subscription is considered used at the point of activation and you waive your rights to any refund that would have been otherwise related to a physical product.</li>
                        <li>If a subscription has been purchased without your prior knowledge and it is reported  within the first 14 days of the purchase World Anvil will refund the purchase. You will need to provide documentation from the local to you authorities proving that you have been a victim of a scam or other illegal activity.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li> In order to allow the user to test the product, World Anvil provides a free membership and monthly reoccuring subscriptions.</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="p1" id="21"><b>22. Owned Assets & Website Integrity</b></p>
            <p class="p1">Any change done using web or other technologies to the core structure of the website will be frowned upon. Users with access to CSS editing of the website are not permitted to alter the content and/or the design of the header and the footer of World Anvil.

            <p class="p1" id="21"><b>23. Lifetime membership</b></p>
            <p class="p1">
