<li><strong>Subscription Fees:</strong> You understand that certain services require monthly and/or annual payments (&ldquo;Subscription Fee&rdquo;) to continue to use such services. These fees are posted and updated periodically on the Evercoder&rsquo;s Moqups web site (moqups.com).</li>
<li><strong>Payment:</strong> Unless otherwise stated, all fees are in U.S. Dollars. A valid credit card or a PayPal payment validation is required for Subscription Fees and Transaction Fees. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number. An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately be billed to you. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your plan will NOT cause any data/content loss but some features may become unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>General:</strong> You agree to pay all charges that are applicable to you as set forth on the Evercoder website and/or in these Terms of Service. You agree that the address and email address you provide in your account settings are valid addresses and that Evercoder may contact you at such addresses or through other electronic or facsimile communications. Evercoder reserves the right, at any time and at its discretion, to change any fees and any other pricing terms. Any changes shall be posted on the Evercoder website and will be effective after such posting. Evercoder reserves the right but has no obligation to notify you through the contact information you provide of any such changes.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> We will automatically bill your credit card on each periodic renewal subscription term, from the date of your first purchase until you cancel, either by downgrading to a free plan, or by deleting your account. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it&rsquo;s cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, including through a declined credit card transaction, Evercoder reserves the right to suspend your account or reduce your storage to free space levels.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Any fees paid to Evercoder by you pursuant to these Terms of Service are nonrefundable. The Services are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Any exception to this policy is at the sole discretion of Evercoder.</li>
<li><strong>Nonpayment:</strong> If, for whatever reason, your payment method fails, and the payment does not go through, Evercoder reserves the right to suspend your access to the Services. If you fail to pay the applicable charge within five (5) days of the date of suspension, or to otherwise negotiate a payment plan for all amounts then due, Evercoder reserves the right to cancel your account. In the event Evercoder cancels your account for non-payment, all amounts due and unpaid from you to Evercoder for use of the Services shall become immediately due and payable. In the event of non-payment and the exhaustion of the procedures set forth in this section, Evercoder reserves the right to seek payment using any remedies allowed to it by law.
