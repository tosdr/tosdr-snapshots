	</ul>
	<p><strong>Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies</strong>. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (collectively "Cookies") on our websites. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our websites may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our <a href="/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>Analytics</strong>.  We use analytics providers including Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Analytics to collect and process information about your use of our websites. These analytics providers set cookies on your browser or device, and then your web browser will automatically send information to them. They use this information to provide us with reports that we use to better understand and measure how users interact with our websites.</p>
	<p>We may also implement additional add-on services to Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Analytics, such as:</p>
	<ul class="sku-ul ml-4">

	<p>To learn more about how Google<sup>&reg;</sup> uses data, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and Google's page on "<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google<sup>&reg;</sup> uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps</a>." You may download the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools. To learn more about Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Analytics cookies, visit <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" target="_blank">Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>. We use third parties and/or service providers for interest-based or targeted advertising services. These services may serve advertisements on our behalf that are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to websites (including our websites) over time and across different websites. The data collected may be associated with your personal information. These advertisements may appear on our websites and on other websites, and may be sent to you via email.</p>
	<p>We use Google<sup>&reg;</sup> Ads to serve ads across various websites. Google<sup>&reg;</sup> uses Cookies to collect data about your visits to our websites to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit. To opt-out of this type of advertising by Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google's collection or use of such data, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/safetycenter/tools" target="_blank">Google's Safety Center</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google's Ad Settings</a> and follow <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&ref_topic=7048998" target="_blank">Google's personalized ad opt-out instructions</a>.

	<p><strong>Video Content</strong>. Our websites contain videos and embedded content provided by VOXX International and other parties, including visible content and/or feeds scripts embedded in the websites' code. VOXX International and such other parties may collect data about how you interact with such content. For example, YouTube may collect usage data on videos embedded on the websites.

	<p><strong>Maps</strong>. The websites contain maps provided by third parties and/or service providers to help you locate nearby dealers. We and such other parties may collect data about how you interact with the maps. For example, Google<sup>&reg;</sup> may collect usage data on maps embedded on the websites.

California residents have certain rights under the CCPA, such as the right to request certain information or request deletion of their personal information. Subject to certain limitations such as (a) exceptions permitted by applicable law and (b) verification of your identity, California residents may exercise the following rights with regard to their Personal Information:</p>
	<p><u>Right to Access</u>. You have the right to access any of the following which occurred in the prior 12-month period: (a) the categories of Personal Information we collected from you, (b) the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected, (c) the business or commercial purpose for collecting your Personal Information, (d) the categories of third parties with whom we shared your Personal Information, (e) the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected from you (i.e. "data portability"), and (f) a list of categories of Personal Information we disclosed for a Business Purpose in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p><u>Right to Deletion</u>. You have a right to request that we delete Personal Information we collected from you. We will comply with such request, and direct our service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions permitted by applicable law.</p>
	<p>How to Exercise Your Rights of Access and Deletion.  To exercise your California rights described in this Section, you may submit your request to us by contacting us at either of the following:</p>
	<p>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@voxxintl.com" target="_blank">privacy@voxxintl.com</a></p>
	<p><u>Verifying Your Request</u>. In order to verify your request, you must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, and you must describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.</p>
	<p>When we receive your request to exercise your rights under the CCPA: (a) we will acknowledge receipt of your request; (b) we will try to match the information you provide in making the request with information we already maintain about you; (c) if required to verify your identity, we may ask you to provide additional information, including personal information; (d) we will consider various factors when determining how to verify your identity, such as the sensitivity and value of the data, the risk of harm, the likelihood of fraud, etc.</p>
	<p>We will only use personal information we collect during the verification process for the purpose of verifying your identity.  If you maintain an account with us, we may use that account to respond to your request and/or verify your identity.  If we are unable to verify your identity as required by applicable laws and regulations, we will decline to comply with your request, and let you know why.</p>
	<p><u>When We Will Respond</u>. We will try to respond to your request for access or deletion within 45 days. If we require additional time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information to you. We may charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.</p>
	<p><u>Authorized Agent</u>. You have a right to submit requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA through an authorized agent. If you choose to use an authorized agent, you must (a) provide signed permission to that authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf, (b) verify your identity directly with us, and (c) directly confirm that you granted permission to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf. For clarity, you are required to verify the identity of both yourself and the authorized agent.</p>
	<p>We may deny a request from an authorized agent if we do not have proof that they are authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
	<p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>. You have a right to exercise the above requests and we will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights.</p>
	<p><strong>California Shine the Light</strong>. Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a California resident, you have the right to obtain: (a) a list of all third parties to whom we may have disclosed your Personal Information within the past year for direct marketing purposes, and (b) a description of the categories of Personal Information disclosed, by contacting us via our Data Privacy Manager as set forth above.</p>
	<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong>. We do not respond to Do Not Track requests.</p>
