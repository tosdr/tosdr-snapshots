                and present your claim or dispute to allow us the opportunity to resolve the claim or dispute. Similarly, if we believe we have a dispute with you, our customer service representatives will first contact you in an attempt to resolve the
                dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved by customer service and either you or we intend to seek arbitration, the party wishing to initiate arbitration must send to the other party, a written notice of the claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>”).
 Your Notice to us must be delivered by certified mail and addressed to: HD Legal Department, 1 Blue Hill Plaza (21st Floor), Pearl River, NY 10965. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address or other
                contact information you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (a) describe the nature and basis of
                the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or we may
                commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Except in the event of a Coordinated Claim (as defined below), if
                you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000 or the arbitrator determines
                the claims are frivolous, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Hearing</em></span><em>:</em> If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
                through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be
                conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly
                set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Award:</em></span> In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least US$100 greater than our last documented settlement offer, we will pay your awarded damages or US$2,500, whichever
                is greater.

                five (5) cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (“<strong>Test Cases</strong>”). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten (10) have been resolved. If the parties are
                unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five (5) cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined
                an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against Company. Individuals
                bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to US$250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time

                effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach
                or default.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Confidentiality:</em></span> The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct

                arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award
