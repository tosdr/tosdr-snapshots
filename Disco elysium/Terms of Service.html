Purchases are made via permitted third party stores, such as Steam, Apple or Google, and not via ZA/UM. To the extent that this EULA conflicts with such agreement between you and the relevant third party in respect of any purchase of Virtual Items, the terms of your agreement with the third party app store shall prevail.</li><li>To cancel a purchase of any Virtual Items you should contact the platform through which you made that purchase. If you cannot use Virtual Items due to an error or fault, you may still be charged. If this happens, please contact ZA/UM and we will endeavour to rectify the issue and if we are unable to do so you may be entitled to a refund via the platform through which you made that purchase.</li><li>Virtual Items that may be purchased (e.g. through permitted stores such as Steam, Google or Apple) may be advertised in the Game.</li><li>Without limiting Game and Virtual Item purchases from ZA/UM’s permitted stores, it is a condition and fundamental term of this EULA and your use of the Game that you must not buy, sell, barter, swap, exchange, trade, lend, rent or otherwise deal in any way with any Virtual Item outside of the Game (such as on unauthorised item trading sites) or in any way other than as expressly provided above. Virtual Items may only be exchanged for certain other designated Virtual Items in and as part of the Game only and where that functionality is made available by ZA/UM.</li><li>Subject to Clause 4, ZA/UM may manage, vary, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items in its sole discretion, with or without notice (including not supplying Virtual Items if it is reasonable to do so). Subject to clause 4, ZA/UM shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that ZA/UM exercises such rights. Your statutory rights which cannot be limited or excluded are unaffected by this clause 8.7.</li><li>When you submit, or anyone using your device submits, a request to purchase Virtual Items you are offering to purchase them for the price stated and our acceptance of that offer shall only occur once we make the Virtual Items available to you, prior to which your order may be declined for any reason.</li><li>Please notify ZA/UM immediately if you dispute a transaction involving Virtual Items or believe that any transaction is unauthorised.</li><li>Your statutory rights which cannot be limited or excluded are unaffected by this Clause 8.</li></ol></li><li>Consumer Rights AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION<ol><li>This EULA shall not limit any rights you might have as a consumer that may not be excluded or limited under applicable law.</li><li>Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint you may choose to make, you may want to consider an alternative dispute resolution provider. The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution which can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under this EULA, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking of any term of this EULA, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</li><li>We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation (such as, without limitation, in the event of a business restructure or acquisition).
