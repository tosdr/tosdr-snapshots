					<p>Our website uses technologies to collect summary information about how well our site works, what visitors normally click on, what browsers and platforms site visitors use, and the average connection speeds visitors use to connect to the site. Our website may also utilize device identification technologies to assist in detecting and preventing fraud. We use this information to improve the site and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. </p>
					<br>
					<p>In most cases, these technologies do not collect or use personally identifiable information, such as names or address, and do not associate any online actions with a specific identifiable person. However, in the event we detect fraudulent, suspicious or malicious activity, we will disclose all such information to law enforcement and other third parties as may be needed to enforce our rights, protect our assets and protect the privacy and safety of others. (See also the section entitled <a href="#sharingInfo">"Who we share information with"</a>).</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>
					
					<h3><a id="safeguardingInfo">How we help safeguard your information</a></h3>
					<p>When you ask for free credit reports online, programs encrypt the information you provide on the request form before sending it to the nationwide consumer credit reporting company or companies you select. After the credit reporting company gets the information, it decrypts it. We always operate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help guard your personally identifiable information. This site's security protocols and measures protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or alteration. These measures include internal and external firewalls, physical security and technological security measures, and encryption of certain information.</p>

					<h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
					<p>A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may transfer to your web browser when you visit this website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve your experience and to let computer systems recognize your browser. Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot get your email unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can interpret it.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For more information about cookies and how to adjust your settings to choose your cookie preferences, visit your browser's help section.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h4>Can I refuse to allow cookies?</h4>
					<p>You must allow cookies if you want to get credit reports from the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies through this website. If you do not wish to allow cookies, click <a href="/gettingReports.action" >getting reports</a> for alternative methods for requesting your credit report.</p>
					
					<h4>How we use cookies on this website</h4>
					<br>
					<p>This website uses cookies to: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Allow you to ask for a free credit report from more than one nationwide consumer credit reporting company during a visit without re-entering your information more than once</li>
						<li>Allow us to gather collective statistical data to help us manage and develop this website</li>
						<li>Help improve how you navigate this website</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>The cookies on this site collect information only while you are on the site, not after you leave it to go to other sites on the Internet. No one else can read the data our cookies collect unless you give them permission to read them. We may sometimes use other companies to set cookies on this website and collect cookie information for us. We use the cookie information collected by these companies in the same way we discuss above. Those companies may not use these cookies for their own internal purposes or share the information collected with any party except us and the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies and their contractors. </p>
