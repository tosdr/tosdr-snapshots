Unless we have previously been notified by you that the confidentiality of your Credentials has been compromised, we are entitled to treat any use of the Site under your Credentials as being by you.
</p>
<p>
We may disable access via your Credentials at any time if, in our opinion, this is reasonably necessary to preserve the security and proper operation of the Site or Services, if you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering prove to be false.

You acknowledge that pCloud has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Site or Services or to review or edit any User Content, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Site or Services, to ensure your compliance with these Terms, or to comply with the applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body. pCloud reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any content that pCloud, at its sole discretion, considers as objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.

pCloud reserves the right to limit the traffic generated by one or more of the download links you have generated based solely on pCloud’s discretion. In such occurrences, access to content on these links will be restricted for registered Premium and Premium Plus users only.
</p>
<p>
In the case of such a restriction being imposed, users who have subscribed to Premium plans will be given the option to purchase additional traffic for the limited download link(s).

<p>
Once you delete a file from your pCloud account, it will be moved to a section named "Trash" in your account. The file will be stored there for a limited time period that is based on your service plan. pCloud reserves the right to limit the size of the Trash on pCloud's sole discretion. The Trash has a size limit equal to the storage quota, included in your current pCloud account, up to 2 TB. In case the Trash size limit is exceeded, pCloud reserves the right to permanently remove the oldest files from the Trash to fit the preassigned limits.

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>
pCloud respects your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you. By using the Site or the Services, you also agree to our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>
Among other services and applications, <b>pCloud</b> also provides an encryption service under the trademark <b>pCloud Crypto</b>. This app performs client-side encryption, which means that the encryption process is performed on the user’s device and the plain text files never leave the user’s computer. This ensures zero-knowledge privacy for the user’s data, which means that we, as a service provider, have absolutely no information about the content users store in their accounts, such as file names or file types. The user content is stored in their Crypto Folder, which is locked and unlocked using the so-called Passphrase. pCloud has no access to user’s Passphrase, and once lost, it can never be restored.
</p>

<p><li>
Encrypted Content and Ownership
</li></p>

<p>
In these Terms, <b>"Encrypted Content"</b> shall be used to refer to all content and information that you store or upload using the Encryption Service. All Encrypted Content shall be owned by you or the person who made it available to you to store or upload via the Service. You retain full ownership to your files, folders, directories, including their metadata (file names, thumbnails, etc.) and any information you submit to pCloud for encryption purposes. We don’t claim any ownership to any of your content. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your content or intellectual property except for the following limited rights that are needed to run the Service: we may redundantly store or backup your respective data as set below and we might use trusted third parties, like our collocated data center, to provide the Encryption Service. You give us the permission for all and any actions that we need to undertake to provide the Service. In particular, but not limited to, you agree that pCloud may transfer your data to its servers and between its servers. pCloud states that your encrypted content, encryption key, and passphrase used by you or otherwise submitted to the Service, are stored in an encrypted or non-invertible form. Your Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by pCloud or any third party. Your Encrypted Content can only be decrypted or inverted by you. When using our Encryption service, you undertake that:
<ol>
<li>you own all rights to your Encrypted Content and you have the right to give pCloud the rights described above;</li>
<li>you have paid and will pay in full any fees or other payments that may be related to the use of your Encrypted Content and the Service; and</li>
<li>your Encrypted Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><li>
Global Policies on Encryption

</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>
Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow other users to send you such links. A link to a third-party website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any
third-party website. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.
</p>


<h3>Changes to the Site or Services</h3>
