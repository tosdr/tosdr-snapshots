<p>Last modified: May 9, 2022</p>
<p>Muse Software, Inc. (“Muse”, “Company” or “We”) respect your privacy and commit to protecting it through our compliance with the practices described in this notice.</p>

<p>If you delete your User Contributions from the Service, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or because other Service users may have copied or stored them. Our terms of use <a href="https://museapp.com/terms">https://museapp.com/terms</a> govern proper access and use of information provided on the Service, including User Contributions.</p>
