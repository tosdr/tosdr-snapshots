We’re here to create a safer internet by making comprehensive digital security simple to understand and easy to use. In this document, we’ll outline in detail what we provide you, our customers, and each of our legal obligations. The details contained in this document will be collectively referred to as the “Terms.”</p><p>Here is a quick breakdown of the Terms:</p><p>Who is Aura Identity Guard?</p><p>&quot;Aura Identity Guard&quot;, “Aura”, &quot;We&quot; or &quot;Us&quot; means Aura Sub, LLC and certain of our affiliates. These Terms represent a binding contract between you and Aura Identity Guard.</p><p>When do these terms apply?</p><p>These Terms apply to your use of any Aura Identity Guard products or services offered by Aura Identity Guard as described in these Terms (collectively, the “Services”), including all software provided as a part of our Services (the “Software”), whether through the website found at https://www.identityguard.com or a mobile application, or in any other manner. </p><p>These Terms apply anytime you: </p><p>(i) create an account in connection with the Services; </p><p>(ii) download or use any Software in connection with the Services; </p><p>(iii) use the Services or interact with Aura Identity Guard in connection with the Services in any other way.</p><p>If you are accepting these terms as a result of your purchase of a subscription via an Aura authorized reseller (“Aura Authorized Reseller”) (e.g. CenturyLink Cyber Shield Service), you understand and agree that such Aura Authorized Reseller and its affiliates are responsible for the sale of the Services (“Authorized Reseller Services”), and rates, charges, billing, and payment for the Authorized Reseller Services. In the event of any conflict between these terms of service and the Subscriber agreement that you agreed to at the time of purchase of the Authorized Reseller Services, the Subscriber agreement will control for billing and payment related matters, and for all other matters, these Terms will be applicable and binding.</p><p>How do you agree to our terms?</p><p>You are agreeing to these Terms when you sign up for or use the Services and any time you access or use the Services. We encourage you to read our Terms carefully, specifically the automatic renewal terms and mandatory arbitration, which significantly affect your legal rights.</p><p><strong>IN PARTICULAR, THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES U.S. USERS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH AURA IDENTITY GUARD OR ITS AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. SEE SECTION 2.12 BELOW FOR THE DETAILS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></p><p>What is covered by these Terms?</p><p>To make it easier to understand, we’ve divided our legal terms into four parts:</p><p>(1) Billing, Cancellation, and Refund Policies: This covers terms related to billing, automatic renewals, cancellation, and refunds, when billing is handled by Aura Identity Guard. Separate terms may apply if you didn’t purchase the Services directly from Aura Identity Guard. </p><p>(2) General Legal Terms: This covers the general legal terms that make up the contractual relationship between you and Aura Identity Guard such as eligibility, user accounts, binding arbitration, and indemnification.</p><p>(3) Service-Specific Terms: These are terms that apply to the specific Services that Aura Identity Guard is providing to you. You may not receive all Services listed herein if you didn’t purchase the Services directly from Aura Identity Guard.</p><p>(4) License Terms: These are terms that govern how we give you a license to access and use the Services.</p><h3>Part 1. Automatic Renewals And Billing</h3><p>1.1 Subscription</p><p>Our Services are generally billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription”). If applicable and you elect to enroll in a Subscription, you will be billed in advance for your Subscription on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). The length of your Billing Cycle will depend on the Subscription you select. Billing Cycles will typically consist of one (1) month or one (1) year terms (“Subscription Term”). You agree to pay for the Subscription that you select. You also authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file based on the Billing Cycle applicable to your Subscription.</p><p>1.2 Automatic Renewals</p><p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Billing Cycle at the price shown in your account dashboard or otherwise communicated to you by us (“Renewal Price”) unless: (a) you or we have canceled your Subscription at least one (1) day prior to the commencement of your next Billing Cycle or in accordance with Section 1.4 below, or (b) an event under Section 1.6 occurs in which case we will give you prior notice according to that Section. We will email you in advance to let you know your Subscription is due for renewal and provide the renewal price in your account dashboard. You may cancel your Subscription by contacting us via the phone number or email address in your account dashboard which at the time of publishing is 1-855-993-3061 and <a href="mailto:customercare@identityguard.com">customercare@identityguard.com</a>, or by logging into your account.</p><p>Once we or you have canceled your Subscription, your recurring subscription fees for the Services will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your Subscription will remain active only until the end of the current Billing Cycle.</p><p>You may also be eligible for a refund depending on the specific plan and offer you subscribed to in accordance with the applicable section(s) below. </p><p>1.3 Plan Switching</p><p>In the event Aura allows you to switch your Aura Identity Guard Subscription plan and you choose to do so, we will send you an email confirming the plan change, and reflect any credit or amount owed due to the difference in changing plans, and the Billing Cycle for the new plan. Your plan switch will be effective as of the date shown in your account profile and confirmation email, which will generally be tied to the date you elect to switch your plan.</p><p>1.4 Money Back Guarantee</p><p>Certain Services may include a Money Back Guarantee if you are not satisfied for any reason. If a Money Back Guarantee is offered for the Services, the terms of the Money Back Guarantee will be visible in your account profile. </p><p>1.5 Payment Methods</p><p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us or our third-party payment processor with accurate and complete billing information which may include full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p><p>Unless we expressly provide otherwise, all amounts paid are non-refundable. You further agree to be responsible for any applicable state, federal or other taxes that may be associated with the Services, including sales taxes, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars. </p><p>If the billing method you provide is a credit or debit card (“Payment Card”), you: </p><p>(a) represent that you are authorized to use such Payment Card; </p><p>(b) authorize us to charge your Payment Card periodically for the Subscription fees when due, including upon sign up for the Services and each subsequent Billing Cycle; </p><p>(c) agree to keep your Payment Card details valid and current; and </p><p>(d) agree to pay any processing fees that are charged by the third-party payment processors or Payment Card issuer. </p><p>If your Payment Card is declined when we attempt to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If we do not receive payment, we may suspend or terminate your Subscription.</p><p>1.6 Fee Changes</p><p>We may change the fees that we charge for the Services at any time at our sole discretion, provided that we will give you at least thirty (30) days of prior notice of such changes. Unless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the Subscription fees will take effect in the Billing Cycle immediately following our notice to you.</p><p>1.7 Aura Authorized Reseller Refund Policy</p><p>You may cancel your service at any time by calling 1-877-352-0863 or any other number provided to you by Aura Identity Guard or through your online account. If you enrolled in our Services as part of an employee benefits program, the following refund terms apply. </p><p><strong>Employee Benefits Voluntary User Program: </strong>If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits Voluntary User Program (where you are offered to sign up and pay for the Services via payroll deduction), you must contact your employer to cancel the Service.      The disposition of any refunds is between you and your employer.</p><p><strong>Employee Benefits Employer Paid Program:</strong> If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits Employer Paid Program (where the employer pays for the Services to be provided with an option for you to purchase additional Services via credit card purchase), any Services paid for by the employer will not result in any refund to you at time of cancellation.      If you purchased additional Services via credit card, no refunds are provided.  The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle.</p><p><strong>Employee Benefits User Direct Enrollment Program:</strong> If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits User Direct Enrollment Program (where you pay for the Services directly), no refunds are provided.  The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle.</p><p><strong>Other Reseller Programs</strong>: If you enrolled in our Services via Other Reseller Programs, no refunds are provided by Aura. The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle. Should you have questions, please contact your Reseller as any disposition of refunds, if owed, is between you and the Reseller. </p><h3>Part 2.

By downloading, using, or accessing the Services, you represent and warrant that you are Eligible. If you are a parent or legal guardian of either (1) a user under the age of majority or (2) a senior or elderly user (“Senior Member”) with limited use allowed under the Services, by allowing the Child Member and/or Senior Members (together, “Junior Members”) to use the Services on the Family Plan or through Parental Controls, you are acknowledging that you are subject to these Terms and responsible for the Junior Members’ activity on the Services. See more details below for the Family Plan and Parental Controls.

If you do not provide this information, if we cannot verify your identity or if our service providers are unable to successfully provide the features in the Subscription plan you’ve selected based on the information you have provided, we may refuse to allow you to use certain features (for example, some credit based features), and we may automatically enroll you in a version of our Services that has fewer features (for example, only including non-credit features). </p><p>2.2 User Data, Accounts and Passwords</p><p>You are fully and solely responsible and liable for the content and data you enter into our Services. Registration as a user or subscriber with the Services may require both a user name and a password, and certain portions of the Services may require the use of multiple one-time or persistent passwords. You should consider your user names and passwords as confidential information. Anyone with knowledge of both your user name and password can gain access to the restricted portions of the Services and your account. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Services or third-party service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. We reserve the right to block a user’s account and/or prohibit a user from using the Services in the event of any suspected or actual fraud or a violation of these Terms, as determined in our sole discretion.</p><p>2.3 User Submissions, Feedback; Beta Features; Updates</p><p>If you submit to Aura Identity Guard feedback and/or reviews, suggestions, comments, or ideas relating to the Services (“Submissions”), you are granting to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law to Aura Identity Guard and its affiliated companies a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the Submission in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum, now known or hereafter developed, to improve or market the Services or for any other reasonable business purpose.

By providing a Submission to Aura Identity Guard, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission that are necessary for you to provide it, including Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that: (i) all content of your Submissions must be accurate; (ii) you will not provide a Submission that is known by you to be false, inaccurate or misleading and/or may be reasonably considered to be defamatory, libelous, hateful, offensive, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to anyone; (iii) you will not provide a Submission that infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) you will not provide a Submission that violates any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (v) you will not provide a Submission for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third party; (vi) you shall not provide any Submission that includes information that references other websites, addresses, email addresses, contact information, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information for anyone; and (vii) you will not provide a Submission that contains any potentially damaging computer programs or files.</p><p>You are responsible for your Submissions and acknowledge that once published, we cannot always remove them.

The beta features are provided on an “as is” basis and you acknowledge and agree that all use of beta features is at your personal risk.

It affects your rights.</p><p>(A) Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer&#x27;s satisfaction by contacting us via the phone number or email address in your account dashboard which at the time of publishing is 1-855-993-3061 and <a href="mailto:customercare@identityguard.com">customercare@identityguard.com</a>. In the unlikely event that customer service is unable to resolve a complaint you may have with Aura Identity Guard or Aura Identity Guard’s service Provider(s) to your satisfaction (or if Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service Provider(s) have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after attempting to do so informally), you, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, each agree to resolve those disputes under the Arbitration Agreement contained in this Section 2.12. The Arbitration Agreement requires you to resolve all disputes (other than those expressly exempted in this Section 2.12) through binding arbitration on an individual basis, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted by law. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.      Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.      Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.      We will pay all costs of arbitration, no matter who wins, so long as your claim is not frivolous. However, in arbitration, you, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees to the same extent they would be available in court.</p><p>(B) <strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong> – You, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, agree that any claim or dispute (&quot;Claim&quot;) between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules for consumer arbitrations, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA and appear at adr.org. Aura Identity Guard can also help put you in touch with the AAA. The parties intend that this agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) be construed broadly, such that this Arbitration Agreement includes any Claims by you against Aura Identity Guard or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s) as well as their respective corporate affiliates for any claims, disputes, or causes of action related in any way to (i) your use of the Services or (ii) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, applicability, or validity of these Terms or any part of them (including this Arbitration Agreement). </p><p>You agree that, by entering into these Terms or otherwise using the Services, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. At your request, we will promptly reimburse you for the payment of your arbitration filing fee. (The filing fee for consumers currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.  If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request). The arbitrator shall be authorized to award whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, other than relief reserved for the courts by law or statute. YOU, ON ONE HAND, AND AURA IDENTITY GUARD AND/OR AURA IDENTITY GUARD’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Aura Identity Guard agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The parties to these Terms acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement is made according to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (&quot;FAA&quot;), except to the extent state law provides defenses or exceptions not preempted by the FAA. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator shall follow substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA and shall honor any claims or privileges recognized by law.      The terms of this Section 2.12 shall survive any termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement, provided that they are brought and maintained as individual claims and not in any class, consolidated, or representative capacity: (1) claims you may have which relate to your credit report, or any claims arising out of or relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and/or the FCRA’s state law equivalent(s) or (2) claims properly lodged in a small claims court of the United States.</p><p>2.13 Prohibited Conduct</p><p>BY USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE NOT TO:</p><ul role="list"><li>use the Services for any fraudulent, harassing, or abusive purpose, or to damage or cause risk to our business, reputation, employees, subscribers, facilities, or any person;</li><li>use the Services for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law;</li><li>use the Services for any commercial use, it being understood that the Services are for personal, non-commercial use only;</li><li>use the Services if you are not Eligible;</li><li>remove, circumvent, disable, damage, or otherwise interfere or deny service in any way or form with security-related features of the Services, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of the Software, or features that enforce limitations on the use of the Services;</li><li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Services or any part thereof; and</li><li>intentionally interfere with or damage the operation of the Services, by any means, including uploading or otherwise disseminating viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code.</li></ul><p>2.14 Digital Millennium Copyright Act</p><p>It is Aura Identity Guard’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

You are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer reporting agencies free of charge under the following circumstances:</p><p>a. You have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty (60) days as a result of your credit report.</p><p>b. You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the date on which I made the certification.</p><p>c. You are a recipient of public welfare assistance </p><p>d. You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud</p><p>e. Annually at <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank">www.annualcreditreport.com</a></p><p>Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for the disclosure.</p><p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act permits you to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file. You understand that accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from Aura Identity Guard to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in my Experian file or to receive a copy of your Experian consumer credit report. </p><p>Experian’s National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by Aura Identity Guard. The disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian. Consumers residing in the States of Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont may receive a free copy of their consumer credit report once per year and residents of the State of Georgia may receive two copies per year. </p><p>Fraud Alerts are available to any eligible consumers—free of charge—from a national consumer reporting agency.</p><p>NOTICE TO ILLINOIS RESIDENTS: MANY GOVERNMENT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OR AT A NOMINAL COST FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO GIVE YOU A COPY OF YOUR CREDIT RECORD UPON REQUEST AT NO CHARGE OR FOR A NOMINAL FEE.</p><p>The Services are not intended to substitute for any free credit report or disclosure that any credit reporting agency or bureau is required by law to provide to you. Neither you nor anyone else has the right to have accurate and current information removed from your credit report. If information in your credit report is inaccurate, you have the right to dispute it by contacting the credit bureau directly.</p><p>VANTAGESCORE 3.0 CREDIT SCORE: VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian®, TransUnion®, and Equifax®. VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you&#x27;ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p><p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day. Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.</p><p>There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers. Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don&#x27;t be surprised if your lender gives you a score that&#x27;s different from your VantageScore. (And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores). Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender’s score. If the lender&#x27;s score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p><p>Certain Public Records Monitoring: The sex offender (“Offender”) information that is used for a specific feature for the Services to monitor for if your information is added to a sex offender registry is derived from official public records. As such, the accuracy of the information provided through the Services may vary based upon the accuracy of such official public records. In certain cases, we may not obtain all the address information associated with the Offender who is contained in the public record. Aura Identity Guard has no control over the contents of official public records. If you believe the information found using this feature is incorrect, please contact the local police department in the applicable jurisdiction for assistance. That police department will be able to assist you directly or refer you to the appropriate authority. </p><p>3.4 Data Broker Opt Out</p><p>If you sign up for the Data Broker Opt Out Services, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</p><p>(i) On your behalf, Aura Identity Guard will make reasonable efforts to have your personal information that you provided to us removed or suppressed (“opt-out”), in whole or in part, from approximately 20 third party databases and/or websites (the “Data Brokers”), a list of whom is available upon request.  You understand that we will only be able to submit opt outs for the information you provide to us.</p><p>(ii) You expressly authorize Aura Identity Guard, its agents, and its employees, to act as your personal representative or authorized agent to submit opt outs to Data Brokers and otherwise implement the Services, Services and if applicable and available to you, for any Junior Members under the Family Plan, including by acting to:</p><ul role="list"><li>obtain information on your behalf;</li><li>submit your personal information to Data Brokers;</li><li>communicate with Data Brokers or other third parties on your behalf;</li><li>take any other actions that Aura Identity Guard believes is reasonably necessary to opt you out of a Data Broker.</li></ul><p>(iii) The extent of the opt-out will vary based on the Data Broker, and its terms and practices.

A Data Broker’s treatment or use of your information will be subject to the Data Broker’s policies, if any, and not these Terms or the Aura Identity Guard Privacy Policy.</p><p>(viii) While we will make reasonable efforts to remove your information, the success of the Services is ultimately dependent on the cooperation of the Data Brokers.

Use of the Parental Control features may include “reward” activities for users who are seeking to ensure that their children or other dependents are successfully completing tasks. As an example, a user may condition access to web content on the successful completion of homework or chores. Aura Identity Guard does not monitor, nor can it verify, user activity with respect to such reward activities. We make no representations about the effectiveness of such methods.</p><p>3.10 Anti-Virus/Malware Removal</p><p>If your Subscription includes our <a href="https://www.aura.com/legal/aura-antivirus-software-license-and-terms-of-service" target="_blank">Anti-Virus</a> or Malware Removal Services, or a similar service whereby we or one of our partners access your device to attempt removal of malware or perform other specified services, additional terms may apply.
