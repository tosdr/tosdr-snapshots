<h3><strong>10. Indemnification</strong></h3>
<p>You agree that you will be responsible for any damages resulting from your violation of these Terms. You further agree to indemnify and hold us, and by extension our owners, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, contractors, or service providers, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, made by any third party to or arising out of: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) your violation of any law or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of the Services or our social media sites; or (iii) information that you provided to us through the Services.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; and Class Action Waiver</strong></h3>
<p>EXCLUDING DISPUTES ADDRESSED THROUGH ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, OHIO IN RELATION TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF REMOVAL OR TRANSFER WHETHER DUE TO FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR OTHER REASON. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Transaction Act (UCITA) are expressly excluded from these Terms.</p>
<p>We are reachable via the contact information at the end of these Terms to address any concern you may have regarding your use of the Services. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to you initiating a lawsuit or arbitration against us. Any matter or dispute relating in any way to your use of the Services or these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided below.</p>
<p>Excluding claims by us for injunctive or other non-monetary relief, any claims related to the Services and any dispute or controversy arising out of or related to these Terms (including the Website Privacy Policy), including without limitation, any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise) or disagreements concerning the existence, breach, interpretation, application, or termination of these Terms, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Inc. Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment on any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking immediate injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate. The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all confidential information, all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by the other party in the proceedings and not otherwise in the public domain, except to the extent that disclosure may be legally required of a party, necessary to protect or pursue a legal right, or to reinforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall take place in Columbus, Ohio or at the option of the party seeking relief, online, by telephone, via written submissions alone or in your state of residence if requested, and be administered by JAMS; provided however, that in the event that five (5) or more individuals seek to initiate (or do initiate) arbitration proceedings against us in a coordinated or related manner (e.g., coordination among plaintiffs or their counsel with regard to similar claims), then instead of such arbitrations being administered by JAMS, we may elect in our sole discretion to consolidate such arbitrations before an arbitrator mutually agreed-upon by the parties (and terminate any pending administration by JAMS), (i) with such arbitrator being a retired federal or state judge and experienced with the subject matter of the arbitration, and (ii) except with respect to administration of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator shall follow the JAMS Inc. Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or a similar set of procedures from the arbitration organization that the selected arbitrator is associated with.</p>
<p>YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRAIL IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. IN ADDITION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT FOR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED ABOVE, YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY TO A DISPUTE HEREUNDER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and we agree (of for consolidated arbitration as provided above), no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
