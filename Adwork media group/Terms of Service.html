                        <b>Payment</b><br>
                        AdWork Media Group, LLC shall pay any amounts due to the publisher on or about the 30th of every month for the revenue generated between the 1st to 31st of each previous month. AdWork Media reserves the right to reduce any payments owed to Publisher as a consequence of any offsets taken by Advertisers for invalid Events, technical errors, tracking discrepancies, poor click-quality and the like. AdWork Media shall compile, calculate and electronically deliver data required to determine Publishers billing and compensation. AdWork Media will issue to Publisher any positive balance in Publisher's Account for Transactions reported for the previous relevant period. AdWork Media shall have no obligation to make payment of any Commissions for which AdWork Media has not received payment from the relevant Merchant of all monies due to AdWork Media (including for all Commissions owed by such Merchant to all of such Merchant's Publishers) until such payment has been received.<br><br>
                        AdWork Media determines the actual payments to your account.  Any concerns or questions regarding your payout need to be submitted to AdWork Media in writing within (3) business days of your receiving the payment that is in question.  If no question is raised within (3) business days then your payout will be considered fair and accurate by you the Publisher.<br><br>
                        All amounts will be paid in US dollars. No payments will be issued for any amounts less than the "Payment Threshold". All such amounts below the Payment Threshold shall be aggregated and paid when the Payment Threshold has been met. Lead Earnings and Referral Earnings both have separate, independent Payment Thresholds of $35 US Dollars and $5 US Dollars respectively.<br><br>
                        AdWork Media will not pay for any Events that occur before a Program is initiated, or after a program terminates. Invoices submitted to AdWork Media and payments made to Publisher shall be based on the Events as reported by AdWork Media. AdWork Media will not be responsible to compensate Publisher for Events that are not recorded due to Publisher's error or for nonpayment by the Advertiser. AdWork Media may require a Publisher to provide a W-9, and similar such information, as a condition to payment. Adwork Media also reserves the right to deduct commission from any future payments for leads reversed/charged back after they were paid in a previous payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Termination</b><br>
                        AdWork Media reserves the right to terminate any Publisher's relationship with the AdWork Media Network at any time, with or without cause. Termination notice may be provided via email or any other public means and will be effective immediately. Upon receipt of such termination notice, Publisher agrees to immediately remove from his/her website AdWorkMedia.com's HTML/JavaScript code associated with AdWork Media.com's campaigns and tools. Publisher will be paid, in the next scheduled payment cycle, all legitimate earnings due up to the time of termination. Upon termination, and in the event that blatant fraudulent activities have been documented in the AdWork Media server logs, no past or future payments will be made by AdWork Media to the publisher.

                        You may refer others to join AdWork Media as a new Publisher, using a referral link found in the Tools section of your Publisher account. In order for a referred publisher to constitute as a valid referral the following must be true:
                    </p>
                        <ul class="terms">
                            <li> Referred publisher must be new to AdWork Media, applying for an account for the first time. </li>
                            <li>Referred publisher must not be a business partner and must not live with you. </li>
                            <li> Referred publisher account must not be directly or indirectly under your control. </li>

                        </ul>
                    <p>Validity of referrals is at the sole discretion of AdWork Media, and a publisher account may be removed from your referral list at any time if we believe one of these guidelines has been broken. Publishers receive 3% commission on the payable lead earnings of your referrals. We reserve the right to alter this rate at any time. Commissions are paid on a net-30 schedule similar to our Lead Earnings payment schedule. You must meet the minimum Referral Earnings Payment Threshold of $5 US Dollars prior to payment.</p>
                    <p>Referrals must register using your unique referral link to our Publisher application page. Referrals cannot be credited to your account retroactively or manually. Referrals must also be in good standing at the time your referral commissions are paid, in order for you to earn valid commission on that referral. </p>

                        <b>Promotions</b><br>
                        When available, one-time promotions & monthly performance bonuses can be activated through the publisher promotion manager.

If Publisher is notified that fraudulent activities may be occurring on its Media, and Publisher fails to take prompt action to stop the fraudulent activities, then, in addition to any other remedies available to AdWork Media, Publisher shall be responsible for all costs and legal fees arising from these fraudulent activities. In addition, in the event that Publisher has already received payment for fraudulent activities, AdWork Media reserves the right to seek credit or remedy from future earnings or to demand reimbursement from Publisher.

                        <b>Scrubbing Leads</b><br>
                        Each Program shall have its own criteria for determining the validity of a lead (the "Lead Requirements"), which shall be detailed in the section entitled "Campaign Details" included in the on-site offer summary and the offer-specific instructions emailed by an AdWork Media Affiliate Manager. AdWork Media shall only pay for net or billable leads ("Billable Leads"), which are determined by taking the gross leads from a Program and deducting Invalid Leads and Returned Leads. "Invalid Leads" are those leads that do not meet the Lead Requirements or AdWork Media's general quality requirements. Examples include, but are not limited to, leads that are missing data, do not meet filter requirements, are incorrectly formatted or do not meet certain phone, email and CASS (postal address) validations. "Returned Leads" are those that have met the Lead Requirements, but are rejected due to inaccurate data or the inability to verify user information. Examples include, but are not limited to, leads for which the registrant is not at the phone number or address submitted, "unsubscribes" prior to being contacted, is on the "Do Not Call List", replies with "Did Not Request This Information" or the lead is a duplicate in the Advertiser's database. The AdWork Media proprietary lead processing system is responsible for detecting and tracking Invalid Leads. The Advertiser is generally responsible for detecting and tracking Returned Leads. Billable Leads will generally be determined by the 25th of the subsequent month and will be displayed on the AdWork Media site when available. Accordingly, any statistics regarding Billable Leads appearing on the Site during the month in which the Program is running are preliminary and are subject to adjustment as provided herein.

                        AdWork Media routinely audits leads to uphold our quality standards. We evaluate leads based on IP location and header details passed in transit during redirects through our tracking links. While we employ many automated fraud checks, some manual quality checks are required. AdWork Media reserves the right to revoke or decline any lead for lack of quality.

All right, title and interest in the Leads shall vest exclusively in AdWork Media or its Advertisers.
