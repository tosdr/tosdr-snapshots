YOU WILL BE BILLED IN ADVANCE ON          A RECURRING AND PERIODIC BASIS ("BILLING CYCLE"). BILLING CYCLES ARE SET EITHER ON A MONTHLY OR ANNUAL BASIS, DEPENDING          ON THE TYPE OF SUBSCRIPTION PLAN YOU SELECT WHEN PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION. </p>        <p> AT THE END OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNDER THE EXACT SAME CONDITIONS UNLESS          YOU CANCEL IT OR MOD STUDIO CANCELS IT. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL EITHER THROUGH YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT          MANAGEMENT PAGE OR BY CONTACTING THE MOD STUDIO CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM. </p>        <p> Mod Studio, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription          fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. Mod Studio will provide you with          reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription          before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes          into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. </p>        <h3>Digital Items</h3>        <p> The Service may include digital items, such as digital currency (“Coins”) or power-ups, (collectively, “Digital Items”),          which may be purchased from us for real world money, where permitted by law. Digital Items available to you and          the price of Digital Items may be altered at any time, without notice. Upon acquiring Digital Items, you are granted          a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable (except to the extent expressly permitted) right to use such          Digital Items only in conjunction with the Service for which such Digital Items were acquired. Any Digital Items          purchase is final and non-refundable. The determination of Digital Items to credit or debit to you shall be determined          by us in our sole discretion. All Digital Items remain our property. Digital Items cannot be resold online or in          the real world or traded for non-virtual (tangible) goods or services. You agree that resale or attempted resale          of Digital Items will result in our termination of your access to the Service and termination of all accounts related          to the resale or attempted resale, as well as the voiding of related Digital Items. If we terminate your account          and/or access to the Service or cease to offer the Service you agree that you forfeit all Digital Items associated          with your account and use of the Service. Further, we may, in our sole discretion, administer Digital Items and,          in this capacity, control, modify and/or eliminate any or all Digital Items without notice, for which you are not          entitled to any refund, Coin redemption or any other compensation. You acknowledge and agree that there is no value          to Digital Items or time you spend using the Service, for which you will not be compensated under any circumstances          regardless of whether or not you are able to access the Service. We are not responsible for repairing or replacing          any Digital Items lost for any reason whatsoever including, but not limited to, suspension of the Service, technical          issues or as a result of a third party. </p>        <p> If you create Digital Items for sale through the Services, Mod Studio may permit you to set the price in Coins but          will control all other aspects. Upon the sale of Digital Items you create, Mod Studio may award Coins to your account          on the Service. Whether to award Coins is at the sole discretion of Mod Studio. Coins awarded to you are Digital          Items governed by all terms set forth above. </p>        <h3>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions </h3>        <p> Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may          be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the          applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the Promotion          rules will apply. Promotions may be available for a limited time. </p>        <h3>Refunds </h3>        <p> Except when required by law, all fees, including but not limited to Subscription fees, and all other amounts paid          concerning the Service are non-refundable. </p>        <h3>User Generated Content</h3>        <p> The Service allows users to create, upload, post, link to, store, share and otherwise make available to other users          all types of content including, but not limited to, video games created through the Service and content contained          within such games (each a “Mod Game”), Digital Items, computer code, derivative works, characters and character          names, text, data, logos, graphics, sounds, videos and other content ("User Content"). By providing User Content          you represent and warrant that you have all consents, licenses and rights necessary to provide and license the          User Content and you grant Mod Studio a non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable,          transferrable, worldwide license to User Content to use, broadcast, disclose, display, distribute, modify, make          derivative works of, publicly perform, publish, record, reproduce, sublicense (on multiple levels), translate,          transmit or otherwise exploit for all purposes and in all formats and mediums and with any technology now known          or hereafter developed and for all purposes without attribution, notice, permission or payment to you or a third          party. </p>        <p> Mod Games you create may be set as public or private. If a Mod Game is set as public, all User Content contained          within such Mod Game is visible to the public and can be copied and otherwise used by other users. If you set a          Mod Game as public, you grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive, non-commercial, fully-paid, royalty-free          worldwide license to use, display, perform, reproduce and make derivative works of User Content contained in the          Mod Game but only within the Service (for example, allowing another user to add such User Content to their own          Mod Game). The foregoing license does not permit users to copy and use licensed User Content outside of the Service          or for commercial purposes. If you set a Mod Game as private, other users of the Service cannot see User Content          contained within the Mod Game but such User Content is visible and licensed to Mod Studio as set forth above. </p>        <p> You acknowledge that we are merely acting as a passive conduit for the creation and distribution of User Content          and are not undertaking any obligation or liability relating to any contents or activities on the Service or User          Content.

Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account          on our Service. You have no ownership interest in your account and associated data and all rights in and to your          account are our exclusive property.
