						<h4 id="section-8-2">II. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
						<p>We may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for the purposes outlined in Use of Information above. TruthFinder will not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we have collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>

						<h4 id="section-8-3">III. SALES/SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

						<p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, TruthFinder has utilized third-party advertisers who collect cookies, pixels, or other technologies on our sites to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. We may receive consideration for this sharing. To opt out of this data collection, you can change your cookie settings using the controls we make available on our Site, or through your browser settings.</p>

						<p>TruthFinder has also shared the names and email addresses of users with third party affiliates (“Referral Affiliates”) to use for their independent marketing purposes: TruthFinder may receive compensation from these affiliates, including if you use their services. You can opt out of this sharing by clicking <a href="/privacy-center/">here</a> or by contacting us as set forth in "Contact Information".</p>

						<h4 id="section-8-4">IV. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h4>
						<p>Subject to applicable law, if you are a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, or Colorado, you may have the following rights:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>To Know and Access:</strong> to obtain a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to Personal Information relating to you, and not to any other user.)</li>
							<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> to request that TruthFinder delete your Personal Information. This right may be limited to the extent that TruthFinder is permitted or required by applicable law to retain information. (Note that if you request deletion of your Personal Information, you may no longer be able to use or access the Site. If you decide to use or access the Site again, TruthFinder may consider this a new account, and may collect Personal Information associated with that account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)</li>
							<li><strong>Opt-Out of “Sale” and Certain Sharing Practices:</strong> you have the right to opt-out of certain information sharing practices with third parties who do not act as our service providers. In some states, like California, this information sharing may qualify as a “share” or a “sale,” while in other states, like Virginia, this information sharing may qualify as “targeted advertising” (collectively, “personalized advertising”). If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can opt out by using the controls we make available in our cookie banner and/or your browser controls, by by clicking <a href="/privacy-center/">here</a>, or by contacting us as set forth below.</li>
							<li><strong>Correction:</strong> to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Information that we may have on file about you.</li>
							<li><strong>Obtain additional details regarding TruthFinder’s</strong> information practices: You may have the right to request disclosures regarding TruthFinder’ information practices. (Note that this information is generally available in this Privacy Policy).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In addition to the rights you have with respect to you your Personal Information described above, you also have rights with respect to Publicly Available Information that may be obtained through our Site. If you would like to download the Publicly Available Information that we have retained about you, or suppress your information from appearing in others’ searches, you may do so at <a href="/privacy-center/">https://www.TruthFinder.com/privacy-center/</a>.</p>
						<p>We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you exercise any of the rights listed above.</p>
						<p><i>"Do Not Track" / "Global Privacy Control"</i>: Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Additionally, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which you can learn more about at <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/</a>. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as either a Do Not Sell request or a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising depending on the law applicable to your jurisdiction.</p>
						<p><i>Verification and Appeal Process:</i> We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Site, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.</p>
						<p>If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.</p>
						<p><i>Authorized Agent:</i> Depending on where you live, you may have the right to use an authorized agent on your behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a user to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the user. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of an TruthFinder user, then you can make a request on the user’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below in the “Contact Information” section. Such requests must include a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s full name, address, telephone number and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with TruthFinder that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority. Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with TruthFinder. In addition, for a request under the Right to Know, Right to Delete, or Right to Correct, the email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority directly with the consumer.</p>
						<p><i>Refer-a-Friend, Promotions, and Similar Incentive Programs:</i> We may offer referral programs, promotions such as sweepstakes, or other incentivized information collection programs. We may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide Personal Information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Site. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your Personal Information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Site, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Site. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us as described below.</p>
