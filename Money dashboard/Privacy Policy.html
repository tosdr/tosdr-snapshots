You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p>We will respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><p><strong>Access to your information</strong></p><p>You have the right to ask for a copy of the information which we hold on you (commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p><strong>Correcting personal data</strong></p><p>You have the right to request that we correct personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</p><p><strong>Deleting personal data</strong></p><p>You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. This is more commonly known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</p><p>Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request to delete or remove personal data for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p><strong>Objecting to processing</strong></p><p>You have the right to stop us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will always inform you if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes, or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can usually exercise your right to prevent such marketing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a3d0d6d3d3ccd1d7e3cecccdc6dac7c2d0cbc1ccc2d1c78dc0ccce"><strong><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c0b3b5b0b0afb2b480adafaea5b9a4a1b3a8a2afa1b2a4eea3afad">[email&#160;protected]</span></strong></a>.</p><p>You may also object to us processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong>Restriction of processing</strong></p><p>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p><ul role="list"><li>if you want us to establish the data&#x27;s accuracy;</li><li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li><li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li><li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li></ul><p><strong>Transferring your personal data</strong></p><p>In certain circumstances, you may request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p><p>Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p><strong>Withdrawing consent</strong></p><p>Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time.
