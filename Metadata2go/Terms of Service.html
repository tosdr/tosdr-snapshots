(4) The Provider points out to the Customer that personal data (user-related data) and other information concerning its use (connection data) (i.e. access passwords, up- and downloads), will be stored during the lifetime of the contract as far as it is required to fulfil the purpose of the contract, in particular for invoicing. <br/>
<br/>
(5) The Provider is entitled to pass anonymous user information to third parties for demographic purposes. These anonymous data may be used to generate statistics and quality assurance.</p>
<h3>§ 15 Change of the general business regulations</h3>
<p>(1) The Provider reserves the right at any time to make changes of these general terms and conditions under adequate prior notice of at least two weeks. The announcement will be served through publication of the changed general terms and conditions on the Internet indicating the effective date on the website metadata2go.com. <br/>
<br/>
(2) If the Customer does not disagree within two weeks after publication or if the Customer continues using the ordered services offered by the Provider after the expiration of the period, the changed terms of business are considered as accepted. In particular, the change announcement will be pointed out to the two weeks term. In case of objection, the contract remains with no changes in content and with the current terms and conditions. However, the Provider is entitled to terminate the contract.</p>
<h3>§ 16 Applicable law and jurisdiction</h3>
<p>(1) This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods regulations shall not be applied. <br/>
<br/>
(2) If the client is a merchant, statutory juristic person or public law special legal estate, the jurisdiction for all litigations from this contract shall be the Court in which the Provider’s business location has its seat, provided that an exclusive jurisdiction is not given. <br/>
<br/>
The same applies if the client has no general jurisdiction in Germany or residence or usual stay is not known at the time of the filing of the action.</p>
<h3>§ 17 Final Clause</h3>
<p>If any provisions of these Terms and Conditions are found to be partially or totally invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected.</p>
