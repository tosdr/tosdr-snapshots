    <p>We retain your personal information as long as necessary for Us to provide services to you or you ask Us
        to not
        retain your data. If you no longer want Us to use your information then you can request that We erase
        your
        personal information and close your TIL Services account as soon as reasonably possible, based on your
        account
        activity and in accordance with applicable law(s)..</p>
    <p>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for Our legitimate business interests, such
        as
        fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if We suspend the TIL Services account
        for
        fraud or safety reasons, We may retain certain information from that account to prevent that user from
        opening a
        new account in the future.</p>

    <p>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with Our legal
        obligations.
        For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.</p>

    <p>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly
        visible on
        the TIL Services, even after your account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you
        will be
        removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in Our database,
        but are
        disassociated from personal identifiers.</p>

    <p>Because We maintain copies of personal information to protect from accidental or malicious loss and
        destruction, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from Our active servers
        and may
        remain in Our backup systems.</p>

    <p>You can request for deletion of your information by writing to our designated Grievance Officers, via in
        writing or through email signed with the electronic signature. The list of respective grievance officers
        is
        being provided in Terms of Use.</p>

    <p>Please note that if you have multiple accounts with Us, then you will have to raise separate requests for
        each
        of the accounts, along with the associated email IDs or phone numbers.</p>
    <p>Further, We may retain and use Your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with Our legal
        obligations. For example, We may keep some of Your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing
        obligations.</p>
    <p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
    <p>TIL Service is not intentionally designed for or directed at persons less than 18 years of age. TIL does
        not
        knowingly permit any person who is under 18 years of age to register with the services or to provide any
        other
        personally identifying information. If TIL becomes aware or gets notified that any personally
        identifiable
        information of persons less than 18 years of age has been collected on the TIL Services without verified
        parental consent, then TIL will take the appropriate steps to delete any such information.</p>
    <p>However, We consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s use of Our services.
        Nevertheless, it is Our policy not to collect and process any personal information from children below
        18 years
        of age or offer to send any promotional materials to persons in that category. TIL does not seek or
        intend to
        seek or receive any personal information from children. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to
        believe that
        a minor has provided TIL with personal information without their prior consent, please contact the
        Grievance
        Officer to ensure that the personal information is removed from the TIL Services.</p>
    <p><strong>SECURITY MEASURES</strong></p>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
        alteration,
        disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of Our data collection, storage and
        processing
        practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to
        guard
        against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All information gathered is
        securely stored
        within the Company controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall on
        the
        cloud; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as Our
        security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. If you know or have reason to believe that
        your TIL
        account credentials have been lost, stolen, altered, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual
        or
        suspected unauthorized use of your account, please contact Us by contacting Our Grievance officer.</p>
    <p><strong>UPDATES & CHANGES</strong></p>
    <p>We may alter Our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary changes in technology,
        applicable
        law or any other variant. We reserve the right to amend the terms of this Policy from time to time. Any
        changes
        We make will be effective immediately on notice, which We may give by posting the new policy on the
        Site. Your
        use of the Sites or Services after such notice will be deemed acceptance of such changes. We may also
        make
        reasonable efforts to inform you via electronic mail. In any case, you are advised to review this Policy
        periodically on the Sites to ensure that you are aware of the latest version</p>
