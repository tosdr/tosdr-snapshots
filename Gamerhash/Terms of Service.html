begins with the download and launch of the Desktop Application and ends at 23.59 on the
same
day
</li>
<li>The status of Cryptocurrency mining is updated and saved
on
the
User Account after
converting to Bitcoin and deducting the commission due for the conversion at the end of

disclosed on the individual User Account no later than 12:00 am the next day, and from
the
moment of disclosure, the User can dispose of it.
</li>

exceed
0.00001 Bitcoin, the Cryptocurrency is not disclosed on the individual User Account in a
way
that

and is summed up with the Cryptocurrency that will be mined in the next or subsequent
sessions
after the conversion of the Cryptocurrency mined in the next or subsequent sessions into
Bitcoin.

previous sentence exceeds 0.00001 Bitcoin after the session is closed, the sum of the
mined
Cryptocurrencies is converted into Bitcoin and disclosed in the individual User Account
no
later
12:00 am the next day, and from the moment of disclosure the User can dispose of it.

</li>
<li>Details of the task fulfilment, in particular the activity and the maximum duration of
the
task
fulfilment, are described on the Desktop Application screen after clicking on a given
Campaign.
The default time for the task fulfilment is thirty days. The time to fulfil the task may
be
shorter if
this is indicated in the task description.
</li>
<li>The task fulfillment status may be either:
<ol>
<li>“In progress” – the Campaign whose execution has been started by the User but
has
not
been
successfully completed yet and the time for its fulfillment has not expired;
</li>
<li>“Completed” – the Campaign the fulfilment of which was successfully completed by
the
User;
</li>
<li>““Not done” – the task which hasn’t been completed by the User or whose fulfillment has been canceled by a decision of C-Axe or the Portal Partners. The User is informed about the cancellation of the task in the form of a message displayed in the Application for 24 hours from its cancellation. C-Axe or the Portal Partners reserves the right to cancel the task at any time, including before the expiry of the time specified for its fulfillment. In the event of cancellation of the Campaign, the fulfillment of which has been started by the User but has not yet been completed (“In progress”), the User is not entitled to any claims against C-Axe or the Portal Partners.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The User may fulfill maximum of three Campaigns at the same time – status “In progress”
unless
the task description provides otherwise. C-Axe reserves the right to verify the
correctness of
the User’s completion of a given Campaign within three Business Days from the date of
completion of the given Campaign by the User. If C-Axe confirms that the Campaign has
been
correctly completed by the User, the task receives “Completed” status.
</li>
<li>A given Campaign may be fulfilled by the User only once. The User is obliged to provide
C-Axe
with information or documents confirming the proper completion of a given Campaign
within
thirty days from the date of the end of a given Campaign at the latest. Applications
sent by
the
User after this date will be disregarded. C-Axe or the Portal Partners reserves the
right
to
exclude
the User from the fulfilling a given Campaign if the User performs a given Campaign from
a
Device
or an IP Address from which this Campaign has already been completed.
</li>
<li>Starting the fulfillment of a given Campaign excludes the possibility of starting another
(next)
Campaign for 48 hours from the beginning of the first Campaign unless the task
description
provides otherwise. The possibility of proceeding with the fulfillment of the next
Campaign
is
independent of the success of the fulfillment of the first Campaign.
</li>
<li>For the successful completion of the task, the User receives GUSD or GHX in the number
specified
for a given Campaign on the Desktop Application screen.
</li>
<li>GUSD or GHX are not exchangeable for Bitcoin.</li>
<li>GUSD are only an internal accounting measure at Gamerhash Store and are only redeemable
in

</li>
<li>GHX are token which may be either issued by the User at Gamerhash Store or paid to the

of
the
User.
</li>
<li>The assignment of GUSD or GHX for the completion of the Campaign takes place within 72
hours
from the change of the Campaign status from “In progress” to “Completed”.
</li>
<li>The assignment of GUSD or GHX is made by C-Axe independently or after receiving the
approval
of a given Portal Partner (in the case of organizing the Campaign in cooperation with
the
Portal
Partner).
</li>
<li>Until the assignment of GUSD or GHX
the amount GUSD or GHX due for the completion of a given Campaign (“Completed”) will be
displayed with the “Pending
payment”
box.
</li>
<li>. The use of multiple accounts by the User to fulfill the Campaign on the same Computer
or
from
many Computers from the same IP (multi-account) or using a VPN entitles C-Axe to
refuse to
pay GUSD or GHX, to withhold a payment already made or temporary blocking of the
possibility
of participating in the Campaign. If the User does not have enough funds, on his/her account can appear a negative balance. The new funds will be used to repay
this
debt.
</li>
<li>The refusal of assigment GUSD or GHX may take place in any case of breach of these Terms and
Conditions by the User.
</li>
<li>All rights of the Portal Partners described in these Terms and Conditions apply only to
