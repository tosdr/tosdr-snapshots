(“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) collects, uses, and otherwise processes personal data that you provide to us, or that we obtain or generate, to provide you with our messaging services, including our apps, features, software, and website (“<strong>Community</strong>”).<br/></p><h2><strong>1. Our services</strong></h2><p>We issue unique phone numbers (or other communication accounts) (“<strong>Community Numbers</strong>”) to individuals and entities or their designees (collectively, “<strong>Community Leaders</strong>”). A list of promoted Community Numbers is available <a href="https://www.community.com/phone-book">here</a>. Community Leaders can use Community to message with the individuals who have agreed to message with them  (“<strong>Community Members</strong>”).</p><p>Please also read our<strong> </strong><a href="https://community.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> (“<strong>Terms</strong>”), which describe the terms under which you use Community and our <a href="https://community.com/customer-terms">Customer Terms</a>, which applies to Community Leaders and related customers.<br/></p><h2><strong>2. Our collection of information</strong></h2><p>We collect the following when you use Community:</p><p><strong>Messaging Info</strong></p><p>When you interact with Community Numbers (including by sending text messages to or calling a Community Number), we collect your messages, including message-related information (such as the phone number from which the message was sent, when the message was sent, the content of the message, any attached files or media, and data from interactive features such as reactions, effects, stickers, scheduling, polls, and payments). When calling a Community Number, we may also collect additional message information, such as the content of a voicemail, duration of the call, and keys pressed. When you interact with messages sent via Community, we collect information about those interactions too. We refer to all of this as “Messaging Info.”</p><p>Keep in mind that Community Leaders who receive your message info via Community can save a copy and use that information outside of Community. This includes any personal information you send in a message (for example, your address), so be careful with what you choose to share. If you don’t fully complete your registration with a Community Leader via Community, then some or all of your Messaging Info may not be delivered to them.</p><p><strong>Contact Info</strong></p><p>We may collect information, such as your name, email, phone number, and demographic information such as your date of birth, gender identity, location, or interests (collectively, “Contact Info”) from you when you register with Community or from a Community Leader. Once you register your information on Community, you may be able to connect to additional Leaders without reentering your Contact Info again each time. If you start a conversation with a Community Leader from a supported website or Internet-based messaging service, the required Contact Info and signup process may vary (e.g., the registration process may be integrated into their website or email).</p><p><strong>Member Info </strong></p><p>We or the Leader may analyze your activities (including your Contact Info, Messaging Info, and imported data) and generate insights about you (“Member Info”). For example, if you tell a Community Leader that your favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate, the Community Leader may tag you as a “chocolate lover.” Such insights may be manually or automatically generated on Community or imported by Community Leaders from outside of Community. Community Leaders may be able to save or sync their Community address book for use outside of Community, which may include your Contact Info and Member Info.</p><p><strong>Leader Info</strong></p><p>To sign up as a Community Leader, you need to provide intake information and/or set up a Community account. This may involve your name, email address, phone number, business information, and other information. Through that account, you may also provide email addresses and other login information for additional authorized users for the account.  You may customize your account by providing a profile name, profile picture, bio, social media handles, automated responses, branded images, and voicemail messages. If you integrate your Community Leader account with another service, we may receive information from that integration, such as your business information, information about your contacts, or financial information. This includes, for example, syncing your address book, your customer or marketing platform, or other data source. You can disconnect your integrations at any time, which will stop syncing Community with that service going forward (existing data may remain on Community). Collectively, we refer to this information associated with a Community Leader’s account as “Leader Info.”</p><p><strong>Technical Info</strong></p><p>When using Community, including registering to become a Community Member or a Community Leader when using our apps and website, clicking on links or media in messages sent via Community, or using Leaders’ online properties that embed our tags or forms, we collect Internet, electronic activity, and other information automatically from the devices and browsers that you use and from the messages that you send (collectively, “Technical Info”). This includes information about the type of device and operating system you use, your phone number, your IP address and location, cookie and device identifiers, the type and version of browser you use, app version, and your ISP or wireless carrier. We may also collect information about your location, such as by using your IP address to determine your approximate location. When using our apps and website as a Community Leader, we also collect information about the links you send or click on, pages you view, other information about how you use Community, and other standard server log information.</p><p><strong>Payment Info</strong></p><p>In certain situations, you may provide us or our payment processors with payment information, such as your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.</p><p><strong>Correspondence</strong></p><p>When you contact our customer support or sales teams, participate in one of our surveys, contests, or promotions, or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p><p><strong>Other Info</strong></p><p>We may also receive or sync information about you from other sources, including from Community Members, Community Leaders, third-party services, partners, and organizations. We may aggregate or de-identify the information described above. Aggregated or de-identified data (meaning data that cannot reasonably be tied to you or used to identify you) is not subject to this Privacy Policy.<br/></p><h2><strong>3. Our use of information</strong></h2><p>We use the information described above for the following business purposes:</p><ul role="list"><li>to manage and promote Community Numbers, onboard people to Community, and enable messaging with Community Leaders;</li><li>to operate the Community platform for Community Leaders, including by offering our websites and apps, analyzing Messaging Info and Contact Info, automating and scheduling messages, and integrating with external systems and data;</li><li>to market Community to potential and current Community Members and Community Leaders;</li><li>to otherwise develop, operate, improve, deliver, promote, maintain, and protect Community services (including troubleshooting, data analytics, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes) ;</li><li>to send you communications and respond to your communications (for example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about Community);</li><li>to manage our relationship with you (including providing you with the information, products and services that you request from us); and</li><li>to keep Community and our users safe and secure, to enforce our Terms and other usage policies, to comply with legal requirements, and to protect or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li></ul><h2><strong>4.

As a Community Member, you can also view, update, and delete most of your personal information on Community by texting “HELP” to the Community Number and clicking on the link to your member portal. You can also easily unsubscribe from Leaders using this method. If you want to stop receiving messages from all Community Numbers, email <a href="mailto:privacy@community.com">privacy@community.com</a>.

Just double-click and easily create content.</p><h4>Static and dynamic content editing</h4><p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!</p><h4>How to customize formatting for each rich text</h4><p>Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the &quot;When inside of&quot; nested selector <a href="http://google.com">system</a>.</p></div></section></section><div class="footer"><div class="grid-footer"><div class="w-layout-grid grid-3"><div class="footer-logo"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b03728e9361e401b234d0b/6109b7981fe2e4326ba8dbac_Logo-black.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="logo-footer"/></div><div id="w-node-_9a8e7336-7f6a-7902-6353-f0c767e8d38f-67e8d38a" class="footer-menuswrap"><div class="w-layout-grid grid-footer-links"><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Product</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/product/whats-new" class="f-link">What&#x27;s New</a><a href="/product/grow" class="f-link">Grow your Audience</a><a href="/product/manage" class="f-link">Manage your Audience</a><a href="/product/messaging" class="f-link">Messaging</a><a href="/product/results-reporting" class="f-link">Results &amp; <br/>Reporting</a><a href="/product/integrations" class="f-link">Integrations</a><a href="/product/compliance-deliverability" class="f-link">Compliance &amp; Deliverability</a><a href="/product/apps" class="f-link">Web &amp; iOS Apps</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Customers</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/phone-book" class="f-link">See Who&#x27;s Texting</a><a href="/businesses" class="f-link">Businesses</a><a href="/politics-advocacy" class="f-link">Politics</a><a href="/public-figures" class="f-link">Public Figures</a><a href="/entertainment" class="f-link">Entertainment</a><a href="/music" class="f-link">Music</a><a href="/sports" class="f-link">Sports</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Company</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/about" class="f-link">About us</a><a href="/careers" class="f-link">Careers</a><a href="/press" class="f-link">Press</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Resources</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/case-studies" class="f-link">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog" class="f-link">Blog</a><a href="https://incommunity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" class="f-link">Help Center</a><a href="/sms-playbooks" class="f-link">SMS Playbooks</a><a href="/legal-hub" class="f-link">Legal</a></div></div><div class="ftr-btns-wrap mobile"><a href="/get-a-number" class="button ftr w-button">Get Started</a><a href="/get-a-number" class="btn-clear ftr w-button">Log In</a></div></div><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
