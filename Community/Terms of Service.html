Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters will be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</strong></p><p><strong>You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.</strong></p><p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by these Terms. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a>. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other relevant circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the AAA or the arbitrator will determine the location. </p><p>The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. </p><p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at accountservices@community.com with your first name, last name, phone number, and address within 30 days of accepting this agreement to arbitrate, with a statement that you decline this arbitration agreement.</p><p>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will prevent you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.<br/></p><h2><strong>14.

Just double-click and easily create content.</p><h4>Static and dynamic content editing</h4><p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!</p><h4>How to customize formatting for each rich text</h4><p>Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the &quot;When inside of&quot; nested selector <a href="http://google.com">system</a>.</p></div></section></section><div class="footer"><div class="grid-footer"><div class="w-layout-grid grid-3"><div class="footer-logo"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b03728e9361e401b234d0b/6109b7981fe2e4326ba8dbac_Logo-black.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="logo-footer"/></div><div id="w-node-_9a8e7336-7f6a-7902-6353-f0c767e8d38f-67e8d38a" class="footer-menuswrap"><div class="w-layout-grid grid-footer-links"><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Product</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/product/whats-new" class="f-link">What&#x27;s New</a><a href="/product/grow" class="f-link">Grow your Audience</a><a href="/product/manage" class="f-link">Manage your Audience</a><a href="/product/messaging" class="f-link">Messaging</a><a href="/product/results-reporting" class="f-link">Results &amp; <br/>Reporting</a><a href="/product/integrations" class="f-link">Integrations</a><a href="/product/compliance-deliverability" class="f-link">Compliance &amp; Deliverability</a><a href="/product/apps" class="f-link">Web &amp; iOS Apps</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Customers</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/phone-book" class="f-link">See Who&#x27;s Texting</a><a href="/businesses" class="f-link">Businesses</a><a href="/politics-advocacy" class="f-link">Politics</a><a href="/public-figures" class="f-link">Public Figures</a><a href="/entertainment" class="f-link">Entertainment</a><a href="/music" class="f-link">Music</a><a href="/sports" class="f-link">Sports</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Company</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/about" class="f-link">About us</a><a href="/careers" class="f-link">Careers</a><a href="/press" class="f-link">Press</a></div></div><div class="ftr-colwrap"><h4 class="f-nav-title">Resources</h4><div class="f-links-wrap"><a href="/case-studies" class="f-link">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog" class="f-link">Blog</a><a href="https://incommunity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" class="f-link">Help Center</a><a href="/sms-playbooks" class="f-link">SMS Playbooks</a><a href="/legal-hub" class="f-link">Legal</a></div></div><div class="ftr-btns-wrap mobile"><a href="/get-a-number" class="button ftr w-button">Get Started</a><a href="/get-a-number" class="btn-clear ftr w-button">Log In</a></div></div><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
