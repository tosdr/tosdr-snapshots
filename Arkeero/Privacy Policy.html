<p>This Privacy Policy and our <a href="https://arkeero.com/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookies Policy</a> apply to all users, including those who use the Company services without being registered or subscribed to a Company service and those who have registered or subscribed to a Company service.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy is not applicable to data collected by third parties though their websites, even if any of said websites contains links to the Company’s Website.</p>
<p>The Company is not responsible for any content within the privacy policy of third parties and does not give any warranty, explicit or implicit, in relation to the accuracy, legality, exactitude or validity of any website.</p>
<p><strong class="title-h3">2. COMPANY SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>The Website offers you the possibility to manage your user area, configure alerts, receive newsletters, information and advertising about the Company’s and/or third parties’ products and services. The newsletters, information and advertising previously mentioned shall be based on the areas of interest that you may have indicated to us according to criteria of the Website, as well as on your profile. If you wish, you may also join and participate in different promotions, contests and/or raffles.</p>
<p>To use the Company services, you shall register on the Website through the enabled registration form and give your freely and express consent to the processing of your data, as well as to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="https://arkeero.com/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<p>In this regard, you may select through certain check boxes at least three (3) fields of interest among the options provided by the Website.

This procedure shall be carried out though technical means in a totally anonymous and not identifiable manner.</p>
<p>The data transfer aims to match the information with other sources and therefore increase the information on the centres of interest – which may have been defined directly, through browsing or other subscriptions – and refine the advertising campaigns. This is without prejudice to your privacy, which is warranted through the encryption and compartmentation of your data.</p>
