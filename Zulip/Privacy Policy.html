retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our
legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise

Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding
how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of
our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of
certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a
service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal
Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>
<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other
provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident,
the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to
the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this
section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zulip.com">privacy@zulip.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection, use, and
disclosure of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will
provide you with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting, using, or disclosing your
  Personal Data.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data,
  along with a reminder that we do not sell Personal Data.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deletion">Deletion</h3>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have
collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain
exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you
with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested.
If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your
deletion request. Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or
other content that you have sent to another Zulip user. If you request deletion
of your account, all such messages and content will be associated with a
“Deleted User.” In addition, please note that anyone that you send messages or
other content to (or who may otherwise have access to such messages or content
through a Zulip Organization or channel) may have downloaded or copied such
messages or content. Zulip will not be able to delete such downloaded or copied
messages or content.</p>
<h3 id="exercising-your-rights">Exercising Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined
below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow
us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data,
which may include proof of ownership of the email address associated with your
Zulip account, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us
to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these
criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests
that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a
Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need
an account to submit a Valid Request. We will work to respond to your Valid
Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a
Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or
manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we
will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your
request. You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@zulip.com">privacy@zulip.com</a>.</li>
<li>Complete this form on our website: <a href="https://zulip.com/support">https://zulip.com/support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights
on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written
permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may require you to
confirm to us that you did so.</p>

entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties
for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes In order to submit such a
request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zulip.com">privacy@zulip.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom,
Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal
Data, as outlined below.</p>

storage and disclosure. Zulip will be the controller of your Personal Data
processed in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other
provision of this Privacy Policy, the provision or portion that is
more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such
conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any
of the following applies to you, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@zulip.com">privacy@zulip.com</a>. Note that we may also
process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in
connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in
which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the
processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please
contact the controller party in the first instance to address your
rights with respect to such data.</p>

  task carried out in the public interest.</p>

in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a
decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with
additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary
to verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>

  you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement
  such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging
  on to your account in the Zulip web application.</li>
<li><strong>Erasure</strong>:  You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data
  from our systems.  Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or

Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, we will alert you to any such
changes by placing a notice on the Zulip website, by sending you an email and/or
by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal
notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address),
those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are
still responsible for reading and understanding them. We will generally aim to
provide such notice about Privacy Policy changes at least 14 days in advance of
the new Privacy Policy taking effect. If you use the Services after any changes
to the Privacy Policy have come into effect, that means you agree to all of the
changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in
effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
