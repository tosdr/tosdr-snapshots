If Co-Controller cannot reasonably respond to a request by a data subject it may refer the data subject to Controller as appropriate. Co-Controller will provide all other reasonable assistance and execute such agreements as may be necessary to legitimize any Processing or data transfer of Personal Data to Controller or a subcontractor and to ensure an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. In the event that any competent authority holds that a data transfer mechanism relied on by the parties is invalid, or any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data made pursuant to such decision to be suspended, then Co-Controller may, at its discretion, require Controller to cease Processing Personal Data, or co-operate with it to facilitate use of an alternative transfer mechanism.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>7.2 Data Protection Impact Assessments: Co-Controller shall, to the extent required by Privacy and Data Protection Laws, provide Controller with commercially reasonable assistance with any future data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities that Controller is required to carry out under Privacy and Data Protection Laws.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>8.
