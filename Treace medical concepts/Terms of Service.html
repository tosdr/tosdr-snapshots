                            enter, and may or may not be paid consultants of Treace. Treace is not recommending that you
                            utilize any particular surgeon, and you should make an independent determination regarding
                            the qualifications and suitability of a surgeon and any Treace Product.</p>
                        <p>The inclusion of a physician in the Find A Doctor database is not an endorsement or
                            recommendation of that physician, and the fact that a physician is not included in the
                            database does not mean that the physician is not qualified to perform the
                            Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> procedure. Listed physicians have provided the information contained
                            in their profiles, which Treace has not verified. Treace does not verify or monitor the
                            licenses, credentials, accreditations, or qualifications of the physicians listed in the
                            database and is not responsible for the medical advice of any of the listed physicians. You
                            are solely responsible for your communications and interactions with any listed medical
                            professionals, and any information you send to them is not governed by Treace’s Privacy
                            Policy.</p>
                        <p>Some surgeons may represent that they perform the Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> Procedure, but with
                            “alternative instrumentation and implants”. Don’t risk your health, ask your surgeon if they
                            are using the Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> System manufactured and patented by Treace. If they are
                            not, then they are not performing Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> 3D Bunion Correction<sup>™</sup>.
