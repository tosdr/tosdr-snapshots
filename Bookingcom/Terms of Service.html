It&#x27;s your responsibility to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct, and that there&#x27;s enough money available in your account).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5.

Genius rates are for members of the Booking.com Genius programme. There are no membership fees, and it’s easy to become a member - just create an Account. Membership and rates are non-transferable. Membership is linked to a specific Account. Membership can also be linked to specific campaigns or incentives.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. There are different ‘Genius Levels’, based on the number of completed bookings made within a given period for any vertical offered by the programme. Each level provides different travel rewards.

Rewards, Credits &amp; Wallet</h3><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">1. We may issue Rewards to you – at our sole discretion, and subject to (a) the terms here in A13 and (b) any Individual Reward Criteria that apply. If we make a clerical error (i) in calculating your Rewards or (ii) in converting currencies related to your Rewards, we can always change or correct any balances shown.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. <strong>How to get Rewards.</strong> You may, for example, earn and receive a Reward by booking and completing Accommodation stays with participating Service Providers, or by making a certain number of Eligible Bookings in a given time period. Please note that the amount/quantity of Rewards earned will depend on each promotional campaign. We’ll provide details about earning/spending a Reward when it becomes available to earn and/or spend.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. <strong>Where to find your Rewards.</strong> If and when you receive any Rewards, you will be able to manage and spend them from the Wallet, which is automatically created when you create a verified Account. You’ll find the Wallet in your Account menu, and you must be signed in to your Account to access it. If you need to do anything to receive a Reward, we’ll tell you how (through Account notifications, push notifications, and/or emails). Once you have Rewards in your Wallet, we’ll provide any terms and conditions related to spending them. </p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. <strong>Types of Rewards.</strong> Although we only award (a) Credits and (b) vouchers into your Wallet, your Wallet may also help you track the processing of (c) other types of Reward (e.g. Credit Card Cashback) from us. We’ll tell you what you need to know about receiving each Reward at the appropriate time.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. <strong>How to get Credits.</strong> Credits are usually issued as a result of getting a Reward but we may issue Credits for other reasons.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. <strong>Where to find your Credits.</strong> Your Rewards are always stored in the Wallet until they are spent. Your Wallet balance will indicate how much is stored and spendable on Eligible Bookings. You will also be able to access detailed information such as when your Rewards were earned, were awarded, and will expire. If you’re entitled to Cash Credits, you’ll also find out how to transfer them to a credit or debit card (of certain brands). </p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. <strong>Types of Credits.</strong> Each Reward type has its own set of spending and/or usage conditions. In general, all Rewards can only be spent on Travel Experiences that accept Wallet payments. Travel Credits can be spent across different bookings, but vouchers can only be spent on specific Bookings stated within each voucher&#x27;s terms and conditions. Cash Credits can also be spent like Travel Credits or be transferred to a credit or debit card (of certain brands).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">We reserve the right to audit any and all accounts in the Rewards &amp; Wallet programme at any time and without notice to the Member, to ensure compliance with the Rewards &amp; Wallet programme or investigate (alleged) fraud or misuse.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Rewards: eligibility</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8.

When a Reward is available for earning, the Individual Reward Criteria will explain how (and if) you can qualify for it. These criteria may contain and not be limited to:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>time-sensitive restrictions (e.g. offers with expiration dates)</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>platform restrictions (e.g. promotional codes that can only be used in our app)</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>Accommodation service restrictions (e.g. offers that can only be used with specific Service Providers)</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>a minimum spend (e.g. a Reward that you’ll only earn when you spend at least a certain amount on a Booking), and</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>a maximum Reward value (for both monetary and non-monetary Rewards).</div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">10. Rewards cannot be sold, encumbered or transferred in any way to a third party. In the event of an Account holder’s death, their Account will be closed and any Rewards that are pending or available for spending in the Wallet will be cancelled.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Rewards: Credits and vouchers</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">11. You can spend any amount of Travel Credits and/or Cash Credits that you have to offset the cost of an Eligible Booking on participating Platforms (e.g. <a href="https://www.booking.com" class="bf33709ee1 d6d02bd320 af44803caf"><span>www.booking.com</span></a> or a Group Company website). However, you may only spend one voucher on each Booking, and if you have multiple vouchers in your Wallet, their value cannot be combined for spending on any Booking. </p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">12. If that Booking costs less than you have in Rewards, your unspent Rewards will remain available for spending in your Wallet until expiry, unless otherwise stated in each Reward&#x27;s terms and conditions.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">13. If that Travel Experience costs more than you have in Rewards, you must make payment for the remaining amount using a different Payment Method. Failure to do so in time may result in your Booking being cancelled, and your Rewards returned to your Wallet with the original Reward terms and conditions, including expiration dates.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">14. You may spend both Credits and vouchers at the same time on any Eligible Bookings. We do our best to unlock the most savings for you, but it is your sole responsibility to manage how the Rewards are spent. If you have multiple Rewards of a single type, the Reward with the earliest expiration date will be selected for spending by default during payment confirmation. While you may not choose Credits with later expiration dates to spend first, you are free to choose the voucher you prefer to spend first.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">15. If you cancel a Travel Experience that you have already paid for (in part or in full) with Rewards, the Service Provider’s cancellation policy will determine whether or not your money and/or Rewards are refunded. Our Customer Service team will be able to refund any Rewards that you may be entitled to.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">16. You can transfer Cash Credits (but not Travel Credits) to a credit or debit card of certain brands.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">17. Your Wallet’s default currency is determined by your location, residency or another currency we may elect. If you get any Rewards in a different currency, we’ll convert them to your Wallet’s default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">18. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Rewards that haven’t been spent will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">19. We reserve the right to, without notice, cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud or misuse.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">20. If you think you’ve not received a Reward that you should have, please contact our Customer Service team no more than 12 months after you did whatever it was that you believe qualified you for it. Please provide any supporting documentation you have. If you don’t do this within 12 months, you will automatically be ineligible for the Reward and will not be able to claim it.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">21. All Credits have an expiration date, which you’ll find in the Rewards &amp; Wallet activity of your Wallet. If you have any Rewards that may expire soon, we may choose to notify you through emails and push notifications.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">For some products/services, the Service Provider will require an Upfront Payment and/or a payment taken during your Travel Experience. Note that if Wallet payments are involved (for example, when you choose to pay later for an Accommodation Booking), we will charge your Wallet for the selected Rewards during Booking confirmation – so your Rewards will be spent immediately – while any remaining amount will be charged according to the payment policy of your Booking.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Wallet</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">22. All data, including personal data, will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws and regulations. It will be shared with Group Companies or Service Providers as required by the Wallet programme. Lost, stolen or expired Rewards will not be replaced.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">23.

If you don’t follow the rules in this section, we may automatically suspend or cancel your Wallet.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">25. You may not use your Wallet or Rewards in any way that is misleading, unfair, harmful or illegal.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">26. We may set off or settle any or all of your Rewards against any claim we (or a Group Company) have against you. We may do this at any time, and without advance notice.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">27. We may change, suspend or end any aspect of the Wallet or Rewards programme. In particular, we might change:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>these Rewards &amp; Wallet terms</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>eligibility criteria</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>which Rewards we provide</div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">28.

Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4.

In some cases, you’ll find a button marked ‘Request to book’ on the property page.

When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>you should inform the Service Provider</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further.</div></li></ul></div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. Under the damage policy, there’s a limit to how much a Service Provider can charge you through our Platform (the limit is displayed while you’re booking). However, the Service Provider can start a legal claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit doesn’t apply.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">How We Work</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">10.

The company is registered in England and Wales (Number: 05179829) at the following address: 6 Goods Yard Street, Manchester, M3 3BG, United Kingdom. VAT number: GB 855349007. This means that you accept that the process of making a Booking with Booking.com Transport Limited is governed by these Terms – although your actual Rental will be governed by the Rental Agreement with your Service Provider (which you sign at pick-up).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. When you book a Rental, your Booking is either (a) with us or (b) directly with the Service Provider.

If there’s any mismatch between these Terms and the Rental Agreement, the Rental Agreement will apply.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5.

You must check your Rental&#x27;s specific requirements, as many details (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per Rental. So please make sure you carefully read:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>these Terms</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you&#x27;ll see while you’re booking, and</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>the Rental Agreement itself, which you&#x27;ll receive at Pick-up.</div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time (note that some Service Providers have a pick-up ‘grace period’ in case you are delayed). If you arrive after the Pick-up Time (and after the pick-up grace period, if any), the car may no longer be available, and you may not be entitled to a refund from the Service Provider. Please check the Rental Agreement for further information (while you&#x27;re booking your car, please check &#x27;Important info&#x27;, which informs you of any grace period, and which you accept at checkout). If you think you might be late, it&#x27;s vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it&#x27;s because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number. </p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit to drive the car.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. You must show the counter staff each driver&#x27;s full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, let us know as soon as you are aware of this, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence" class="bf33709ee1 d6d02bd320 af44803caf"><span>licence &#x27;check code&#x27;</span></a> no more than 21 days before Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9. You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving licence. Note that all drivers must carry their driving licence (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">10. You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">11.

Price and payment</h3><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">1. Booking.com Transport Limited will arrange the payment for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please refer to ‘Payment’ (A7) above.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Additional costs and fees</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver&#x27;s age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell you if it’s possible, and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it&#x27;s vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They&#x27;ll tell you how much this would cost, and you&#x27;ll enter a new contract with them. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Extras</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. In some cases, you&#x27;ll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. In other cases, you&#x27;ll merely request any extras when you book your car – in which case:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>you&#x27;ll pay for them at Pick-up, and</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>the Service Provider doesn&#x27;t guarantee they&#x27;ll be available for you.</div></li></ul></section><section style="--bui_box_spaced_padding--s:0" class="fa298e29e2 f87c1acc1f"><h3 class="fdd4f3e033" id="terms_cars_amendments_subheading">D6.

If you don’t, the cancellation fee will be the full cost of your Rental - unless you can prove that the situation has cost us substantially less than that.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Amendments (changes to your Booking)</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. You can make changes to your Booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app - or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8.

If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don&#x27;t accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).</p></section><section style="--bui_box_spaced_padding--s:0" class="fa298e29e2 f87c1acc1f"><h3 class="fdd4f3e033" id="terms_cars_know_subheading">D7.

What else do you need to know?</h3><h4 class="e97c03be63">Code share</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">1. Some airlines have ‘code share’ agreements with other airlines. So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’), but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. While you’re booking your Flight, you’ll be informed if it’s a ‘code share’ Flight.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Airline prohibited practices</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter &#x27;point-beyond ticketing&#x27;, &#x27;hidden-city ticketing&#x27; or &#x27;back-to-back ticketing&#x27; into a search engine.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. When you purchase a Flight, you agree not to do this. If you do this in breach of the airline’s terms (provided when you make your Booking), you will reimburse us for any difference between the cost of your actual journey and the cost of the full journey specified on your ticket(s) if the airline claims this from us.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Use of flight segments</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. If your airline does allow you to ‘skip’ any Flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the Flight(s) you don’t want, in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">One-way tickets</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. If you buy two one-way tickets rather than a single round-trip ticket:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>you’ll be making two separate Bookings, each with its own rules and policies</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>any changes to one Flight will not affect the other (for example, if your initial Flight is cancelled, you won’t be guaranteed a refund for your second Flight).</div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. If you’re travelling abroad, you may need to prove to the Check-in and/or Immigration staff that you have a return Flight (see ‘International travel’ below for more on passports, visas, etc).</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Charges, taxes and fees</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9. Your fare will include any taxes and fees charged by an airline or government (except entry/exit fees - see ‘Entry/exit fees’ below). You may be responsible for dealing with any retroactive change in the tax rate.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Service fees</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">10. Depending on which Flight you choose, you may be charged a service fee by us and/or the Third-Party Aggregator.</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>Our service fee (if any) is a fee for using our Platform so you can buy a ticket from a Third-Party Aggregator.

The price of your ticket will include any service fee(s).</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Fees for baggage and other extras</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">12. Your airline may charge for checked baggage, excess/overweight baggage, priority boarding, allocated seating, onboard entertainment, food and drink and/or airport check-in.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">13. If they do, the charge(s) will be on top of the price of your ticket (unless it’s expressly stated that your Flight included the extra(s)).</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">International travel</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">14. It’s your responsibility to:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>carry a valid passport and/or visa if required</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>comply with any entry requirements</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>find out if you need a visa to pass through a country that isn’t your final destination</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>check with the relevant embassy in advance to see if there’s been any change in passport, visa or entry requirements</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>review any warnings or advice from your country of residence/origin before you go to/through a country or region.</div></li></ul><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">15.

It’s not a common practice, but international law allows ‘disinsection’ of aircraft to kill insects. To do this, personnel might spray the aircraft’s cabin with an aerosolised insecticide while passengers are on board, or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they’re not on board. Before you travel, we advise you to find out about disinsection, including where it might happen.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">Entry/exit fees</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">17. Your fare will not include any fee that a country or airport charges people entering/leaving the country and that is collected directly at the airport. Before you travel, we advise you to find out if you’ll have to pay this kind of fee.</p><h4 class="e97c03be63">UK: Your financial protection</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">18. <strong>ATOL Holder:</strong> Booking.com B.V.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">19. <strong>ATOL Licence Number:</strong> 11967</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">20.

You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">23.

It&#x27;s your responsibility to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct, and that there&#x27;s enough money available in your account).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. If you think you&#x27;re not going to arrive on time, please contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you, so they don&#x27;t cancel your Booking. If you’re late, we are not liable for the consequences (e.g. the cancellation of your Booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6.

You’ll see when Credits were received or spent, and when they’ll expire. If you have Cash Credits, you’ll also see a link to cash them out.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. <strong>Types of Credits.</strong> Travel Credits can <strong>only</strong> be spent on certain Travel Experiences.

You can put either Cash Credits or Travel Credits towards the cost of an eligible Travel Experience on a participating Platform (e.g. www.booking.com or a Group Company website).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">12. If that Travel Experience costs less than you have in Credits, your unused Credits will remain available in your Wallet.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">13. If that Travel Experience costs more than you have in Credits, you must make up the rest of the cost in time, using another accepted Payment Method - or your purchase will be cancelled, and your Credits returned to your Wallet.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">14. If you have various Credits with more than one expiration date, the Credits with the earliest expiration date will be used first.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">15. If you cancel a Travel Experience that you’ve paid for (in part or in full) with Credits, the Service Provider’s cancellation policy will determine whether or not your money and/or Credits are refunded. Our Customer Service team will be able to refund any Credits that you may be entitled to.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">16. You can cash out Cash Credits (but not Travel Credits) to a Payment Method.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">17. Your Wallet’s default currency is determined by your location, residency or another currency we may elect. If you get any Credits or Credit Card Cashbacks in another currency, we’ll convert them to your default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">18. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Credits that haven’t been used will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">19. We reserve the right to cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">20. If you think you’ve not received a Reward that you should have, please contact our Customer Service team no more than 12 months after you did whatever it was that you believe qualified you for it. Please provide any supporting documentation you have. If you don’t do this within 12 months, you won’t be able to claim the Reward.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">21.

Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>7. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>8. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>* If there is any damage, the Service Provider can always decide to initiate a (legal) claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit (see 5 above) wouldn’t apply.</div></li></ul><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">How We Work</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9.

You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time: if you’re late, the car may no longer be available, and you won’t be entitled to a refund. If you think you might be late, it&#x27;s vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it&#x27;s because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit (in the Service Provider’s opinion) to drive the car.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. You must have all the documents (such as ID, voucher and driving licence) that you need at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. You must show the counter staff each driver&#x27;s full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, please let us know as soon as possible, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence" class="bf33709ee1 d6d02bd320 af44803caf"><span>licence &#x27;check code&#x27;</span></a> no more than 21 days before Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">10.

Price and payment</h4><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">1. Booking.com Transport Limited is the merchant of record for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please see ‘Payment’ (A7) above.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Additional costs and fees</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver&#x27;s age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell you if it’s possible, and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it&#x27;s vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They&#x27;ll tell you how much this would cost, and you&#x27;ll enter a new contract with them directly. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Extras</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. In some cases, you&#x27;ll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. In other cases, you&#x27;ll merely request any extras when you book your car – in which case:</p><ul class="c01d7b59ed fcbdf16d93"><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>you&#x27;ll pay for them at Pick-up, and</div></li><li class="d044972638 f8e733d28b ea41992eee ef88ed2ec6"><div>the Service Provider doesn&#x27;t guarantee they&#x27;ll be available for you.</div></li></ul></section><section style="--bui_box_spaced_padding--s:0" class="fa298e29e2 f87c1acc1f"><h4 class="e97c03be63" id="nov2021_terms_cars_amendments_subheading">D6.

Otherwise, you won’t be entitled to a refund.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Amendments (changes to your Booking)</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. You can make changes to your Booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app - or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">8. If changing your Booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Changes made by us</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">9. If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don&#x27;t accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).</p></section><section style="--bui_box_spaced_padding--s:0" class="fa298e29e2 f87c1acc1f"><h4 class="e97c03be63" id="nov2021_terms_cars_know_subheading">D7.

What else do you need to know?</h4><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Code share</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">1. Some airlines have ‘code share’ agreements with other airlines. So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’), but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">2. While you’re booking your Flight, you’ll be informed if it’s a ‘code share’ Flight.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Airline prohibited practices</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">3. Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter &quot;point-beyond ticketing&quot;, &quot;hidden-city ticketing&quot; or &quot;back-to-back ticketing&quot; into a search engine.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">4. When you purchase a Flight, you agree not to do this, and to indemnify us against any airline claims for any difference between the cost of your actual journey and the cost of the full journey specified on your ticket(s).</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Use of flight segments</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">5. Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">6. If your airline does allow you to ‘skip’ any Flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the Flight(s) you don’t want, in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">One-way tickets</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">7.

Your airline may charge for checked baggage, excess/overweight baggage, priority boarding, allocated seating, onboard entertainment, food and drink and/or airport check-in.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">13. If they do, the charge(s) will be on top of the price of your ticket (unless it’s expressly stated that your Flight included the extra(s)).</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">International travel</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">14.

It’s not a common practice, but international law allows ‘disinsection’ of aircraft to kill insects. To do this, personnel might spray the aircraft’s cabin with an aerosolised insecticide while passengers are on board, or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they’re not on board. Before you travel, we advise you to find out about disinsection, including where it might happen.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">Entry/exit fees</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">17. Your fare will not include any fee that a country or airport charges people entering/leaving the country and that is collected directly at the airport. Before you travel, we advise you to find out if you’ll have to pay this kind of fee.</p><h5 class="a97e78bbb6">UK: Your financial protection</h5><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">18. <strong>ATOL Holder:</strong> Booking.com B.V.</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">19. <strong>ATOL Licence Number:</strong> 11967</p><p class="eb2c6a4f4b f0a0be55fd">20.

They’re responsible for making sure it’s accurate and up to date.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_we_para_1":"1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Accommodations – and you can search for, compare and book them.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_we_para_2":"2.

Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_you_para_3":"3. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).","nov2021_terms_accommodations_you_para_4":"4. Maintain the security of the Accommodation and its contents during your stay. So don’t, for example, leave doors or windows unlocked.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_price_para_1":"1.

If you cancel a non-refundable booking, or don’t show up, the Service Provider is entitled to a reasonable compensation, being a lump-sum compensation amount of 90% of the price of the reservation. You shall be free to prove that – as a result of such cancellation or no show – the Service Provider has not suffered any loss, or that the loss incurred to the Service Provider amounts to less than the lump-sum compensation claimed.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_1":"1.

Some of the price reductions you see are funded by us, not by the Service Provider. We simply pay some of the cost ourselves.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4":"4. When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4_bullet_1":"you should inform the Service Provider","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4_bullet_2":"instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4_bullet_3":"if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4_bullet_3_sub_bullet_1":"if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4_bullet_3_sub_bullet_2":"if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further*.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_5":"5.

Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_7":"7. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_8":"8. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’.

For the sake of clarity, the fact that we provide you with the means and channels for making inquiries and complaints as described above, and participate in coordinating inquiries or complaints where necessary, does not mean that we have an obligation or responsibility to ensure that you receive a satisfactory answer to your inquiry or that your complaint is resolved to your satisfaction, and we do not assume any responsibility for any rights or obligations arising out of or in connection with any inquiries or complaints between you and the Service Provider.{end_bold}","jan2024_china_terms_of_service_section_a15_title":"A15.

In view of this, it is clear that the rights, obligations and even liabilities arising out of or in connection with your booking and travel experience are between you and the Service Provider.
