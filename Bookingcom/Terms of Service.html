If the Service Provider requires an Upfront Payment, it may be taken or pre-authorised when you make your Booking, and it may be non-refundable.

Some Bookings can’t be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a deadline.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. If you book a Travel Experience by paying in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if applicable), the Service Provider may cancel the Booking without notice if they can&#x27;t collect the balance on the date specified. If they do cancel, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at their discretion. It&#x27;s your responsibility to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct, and that there&#x27;s enough money available in your account).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5.

Rewards, Credits &amp; Wallet</h3><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. We may issue Rewards to you – at our sole discretion, and subject to (a) the terms here in A13 and (b) any Individual Reward Criteria that apply. If we make a clerical error (i) in calculating your Rewards or (ii) in converting currencies related to your Rewards, we can always change or correct any balances shown.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. <strong>How to get Rewards.</strong> You may, for example, earn and receive a Reward by booking and completing Accommodation stays with participating Service Providers, or by making a certain number of Eligible Bookings in a given time period. Please note that the amount/quantity of Rewards earned will depend on each promotional campaign. We’ll provide details about earning/spending a Reward when it becomes available to earn and/or spend.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. <strong>Where to find your Rewards.</strong> If and when you receive any Rewards, you will be able to manage and spend them from the Wallet, which is automatically created when you create a verified Account. You’ll find the Wallet in your Account menu, and you must be signed in to your Account to access it. If you need to do anything to receive a Reward, we’ll tell you how (through Account notifications, push notifications, and/or emails). Once you have Rewards in your Wallet, we’ll provide any terms and conditions related to spending them. </p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. <strong>Types of Rewards.</strong> Although we only award (a) Credits and (b) vouchers into your Wallet, your Wallet may also help you track the processing of (c) other types of Reward (e.g. Credit Card Cashback) from us. We’ll tell you what you need to know about receiving each Reward at the appropriate time.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. <strong>How to get Credits.</strong> Credits are usually issued as a result of getting a Reward but we may issue Credits for other reasons.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. <strong>Where to find your Credits.</strong> Your Rewards are always stored in the Wallet until they are spent. Your Wallet balance will indicate how much is stored and spendable on Eligible Bookings. You will also be able to access detailed information such as when your Rewards were earned, were awarded, and will expire. If you’re entitled to Cash Credits, you’ll also find out how to transfer them to a credit or debit card (of certain brands). </p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. <strong>Types of Credits.</strong> Each Reward type has its own set of spending and/or usage conditions. In general, all Rewards can only be spent on Travel Experiences that accept Wallet payments. Travel Credits can be spent across different bookings, but vouchers can only be spent on specific Bookings stated within each voucher&#x27;s terms and conditions. Cash Credits can also be spent like Travel Credits or be transferred to a credit or debit card (of certain brands).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">We reserve the right to audit any and all accounts in the Rewards &amp; Wallet programme at any time and without notice to the Member, to ensure compliance with the Rewards &amp; Wallet programme or investigate (alleged) fraud or misuse.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Rewards: eligibility</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. To be able to receive any type of Rewards from us, you must, at the time of qualification and spending:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>have a verified Account with us</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>be at least 18 years old</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>meet the Individual Reward Criteria</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>not violate the Rewards &amp; Wallet Terms, and</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>have a valid credit card, if you need to qualify for Credit Card Cashback Rewards.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. When a Reward is available for earning, the Individual Reward Criteria will explain how (and if) you can qualify for it. These criteria may contain and not be limited to:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>time-sensitive restrictions (e.g. offers with expiration dates)</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>platform restrictions (e.g. promotional codes that can only be used in our app)</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>Accommodation service restrictions (e.g. offers that can only be used with specific Service Providers)</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>a minimum spend (e.g. a Reward that you’ll only earn when you spend at least a certain amount on a Booking), and</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>a maximum Reward value (for both monetary and non-monetary Rewards).</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">10. Rewards cannot be sold, encumbered or transferred in any way to a third party. In the event of an Account holder’s death, their Account will be closed and any Rewards that are pending or available for spending in the Wallet will be cancelled.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Rewards: Credits and vouchers</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">11. You can spend any amount of Travel Credits and/or Cash Credits that you have to offset the cost of an Eligible Booking on participating Platforms (e.g. <a href="https://www.booking.com" class="dba1b3bddf d371fb5186 e2ebd44c68"><span>www.booking.com</span></a> or a Group Company website). However, you may only spend one voucher on each Booking, and if you have multiple vouchers in your Wallet, their value cannot be combined for spending on any Booking. </p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">12. If that Booking costs less than you have in Rewards, your unspent Rewards will remain available for spending in your Wallet until expiry, unless otherwise stated in each Reward&#x27;s terms and conditions.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">13. If that Travel Experience costs more than you have in Rewards, you must make payment for the remaining amount using a different Payment Method. Failure to do so in time may result in your Booking being cancelled, and your Rewards returned to your Wallet with the original Reward terms and conditions, including expiration dates.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">14. You may spend both Credits and vouchers at the same time on any Eligible Bookings. We do our best to unlock the most savings for you, but it is your sole responsibility to manage how the Rewards are spent. If you have multiple Rewards of a single type, the Reward with the earliest expiration date will be selected for spending by default during payment confirmation. While you may not choose Credits with later expiration dates to spend first, you are free to choose the voucher you prefer to spend first.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">15. If you cancel a Travel Experience that you have already paid for (in part or in full) with Rewards, the Service Provider’s cancellation policy will determine whether or not your money and/or Rewards are refunded. Our Customer Service team will be able to refund any Rewards that you may be entitled to.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">16. You can transfer Cash Credits (but not Travel Credits) to a credit or debit card of certain brands.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">17. Your Wallet’s default currency is determined by your location, residency or another currency we may elect. If you get any Rewards in a different currency, we’ll convert them to your Wallet’s default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">18. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Rewards that haven’t been spent will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">19. We reserve the right to, without notice, cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud or misuse.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">20. If you think you’ve not received a Reward that you should have, please contact our Customer Service team no more than 12 months after you did whatever it was that you believe qualified you for it. Please provide any supporting documentation you have. If you don’t do this within 12 months, you will automatically be ineligible for the Reward and will not be able to claim it.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">21. All Credits have an expiration date, which you’ll find in the Rewards &amp; Wallet activity of your Wallet. If you have any Rewards that may expire soon, we may choose to notify you through emails and push notifications.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">For some products/services, the Service Provider will require an Upfront Payment and/or a payment taken during your Travel Experience. Note that if Wallet payments are involved (for example, when you choose to pay later for an Accommodation Booking), we will charge your Wallet for the selected Rewards during Booking confirmation – so your Rewards will be spent immediately – while any remaining amount will be charged according to the payment policy of your Booking.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Wallet</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">22. All data, including personal data, will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws and regulations. It will be shared with Group Companies or Service Providers as required by the Wallet programme. Lost, stolen or expired Rewards will not be replaced.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">23. Your obligations:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>You’re responsible for making sure that all information is (and stays) correct, complete and up to date</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>You’re responsible for keeping your Account sign-in details safe and secure in order to safeguard your Wallet.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">24. If you don’t follow the rules in this section, we may automatically suspend or cancel your Wallet.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">25. You may not use your Wallet or Rewards in any way that is misleading, unfair, harmful or illegal.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">26. We may set off or settle any or all of your Rewards against any claim we (or a Group Company) have against you. We may do this at any time, and without advance notice.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">27. We may change, suspend or end any aspect of the Wallet or Rewards programme. In particular, we might change:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>these Rewards &amp; Wallet terms</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>eligibility criteria</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>which Rewards we provide</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">28. We will make reasonable efforts to give you prior notice if we make any changes or we stop providing the Wallet service altogether.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">29. If we stop providing the Wallet service, all Rewards that haven’t expired will be valid for another 12 months.</p></section><section class="e88d6bd51f"><h3 class="b4678dca93" id="terms_all_ipr_subheading">A14.

Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there.

When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you should inform the Service Provider</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further.</div></li></ul></div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. Under the damage policy, there’s a limit to how much a Service Provider can charge you through our Platform (the limit is displayed while you’re booking). However, the Service Provider can start a legal claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit doesn’t apply.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">How We Work</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">10.

Contractual relationship</h3><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. The car rental pages on this Platform are operated by Booking.com Transport Limited. The company is registered in England and Wales (Number: 05179829) at the following address: 6 Goods Yard Street, Manchester, M3 3BG, United Kingdom. VAT number: GB 855349007. This means that you accept that the process of making a Booking with Booking.com Transport Limited is governed by these Terms – although your actual Rental will be governed by the Rental Agreement with your Service Provider (which you sign at pick-up).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. When you book a Rental, your Booking is either (a) with us or (b) directly with the Service Provider. Either way:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>our Terms govern the booking process; when we send you your Booking Confirmation, you’ll enter a contract with us</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the Rental Agreement governs the Rental itself; when you sign this at the rental counter, you’ll enter a contract with the Service Provider (but you’ll see and accept the key terms of it while you’re booking your car).</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">Throughout Section D, ‘Service Provider’ means the rental company that provides the car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. In most cases, you’ll get your Booking Confirmation as soon as you complete your Booking – but if the Service Provider doesn&#x27;t confirm your Rental immediately, we won’t take payment or send you your Booking Confirmation until they’ve done so.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. If there’s any mismatch between these Terms and the Rental Agreement, the Rental Agreement will apply.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. The Main Driver (the person whose details are entered during the booking process) is the only person who can change or cancel the Booking, or discuss it with us - unless they tell us they nominate someone else to do this.</p></section><section class="e88d6bd51f"><h3 class="b4678dca93" id="terms_cars_we_subheading">D3.

We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. We don’t guarantee the precise make and model you’re booking (unless we expressly say so). The phrase ‘or similar’ means you could get a similar car (i.e. the same size, with the same kind of gearbox, etc.). So the car pictures are illustrative only.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3.

What you need to do</h3><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. You must provide all the information we need to arrange your Booking (contact details, Pick-up Time, etc.).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. You must read and agree to comply with these Terms and the Rental Agreement - and acknowledge that if you breach them:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you might have to pay additional charges</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>your Booking might be cancelled</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the counter staff might refuse to hand over the keys at the rental counter.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. You must check your Rental&#x27;s specific requirements, as many details (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per Rental. So please make sure you carefully read:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>these Terms</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you&#x27;ll see while you’re booking, and</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the Rental Agreement itself, which you&#x27;ll receive at Pick-up.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time (note that some Service Providers have a pick-up ‘grace period’ in case you are delayed). If you arrive after the Pick-up Time (and after the pick-up grace period, if any), the car may no longer be available, and you may not be entitled to a refund from the Service Provider. Please check the Rental Agreement for further information (while you&#x27;re booking your car, please check &#x27;Important info&#x27;, which informs you of any grace period, and which you accept at checkout). If you think you might be late, it&#x27;s vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it&#x27;s because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number. </p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit to drive the car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. You must show the counter staff each driver&#x27;s full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, let us know as soon as you are aware of this, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence" class="dba1b3bddf d371fb5186 e2ebd44c68"><span>licence &#x27;check code&#x27;</span></a> no more than 21 days before Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving licence. Note that all drivers must carry their driving licence (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">10. You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">11.

Price and payment</h3><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. Booking.com Transport Limited will arrange the payment for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please refer to ‘Payment’ (A7) above.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Additional costs and fees</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver&#x27;s age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell you if it’s possible, and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it&#x27;s vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They&#x27;ll tell you how much this would cost, and you&#x27;ll enter a new contract with them. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Extras</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. In some cases, you&#x27;ll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. In other cases, you&#x27;ll merely request any extras when you book your car – in which case:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you&#x27;ll pay for them at Pick-up, and</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the Service Provider doesn&#x27;t guarantee they&#x27;ll be available for you.</div></li></ul></section><section class="e88d6bd51f"><h3 class="b4678dca93" id="terms_cars_amendments_subheading">D6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds</h3><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. We go above and beyond our legal obligations. Even though local laws don’t require us to offer specific cancellation rights, we guarantee that we will honour our refunds policy if you cancel your Booking.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2.

If you cancel:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>MORE THAN 48 hours before your rental is due to start, you’ll receive a full refund.</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>LESS THAN 48 hours before, or while you’re at the rental counter, we’ll refund what you paid minus the cost of 3 days of your rental - so there won’t be any refund if your car was booked for 3 days or less.</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>AFTER your rental is due to start (or you just don’t turn up) you’ll receive no refund.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. The counter staff may refuse you the car if (for example):</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>You don’t arrive on time</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>You are not eligible to rent the car</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>You don’t have the documentation you need</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>The main driver doesn’t have a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds for the car’s security deposit.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">For more on your Service Provider’s rules, please refer to the ‘Important Information’ that’s available while booking - or the Rental Agreement that you sign at the counter.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">If they refuse you the car, please call us straight away from the rental counter to cancel your Booking, and we’ll refund what you paid, minus the cost of 3 days of your Rental. If you don’t, the cancellation fee will be the full cost of your Rental - unless you can prove that the situation has cost us substantially less than that.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Amendments (changes to your Booking)</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. You can make changes to your Booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app - or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. If changing your Booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Changes made by us</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don&#x27;t accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).</p></section><section class="e88d6bd51f"><h3 class="b4678dca93" id="terms_cars_know_subheading">D7.

In some cases, they must also be below a maximum age. The limit(s) can vary by Service Provider, by location and by type of car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. Only eligible drivers whose names appear on the Rental Agreement may drive the car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3.

If you pick your car up later (please see D4.4 above) or drop it off earlier than agreed in your Booking Confirmation, the Service Provider will not refund you for the &#x27;unused&#x27; time.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">How We Work</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5.

What else do you need to know?</h3><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Code share</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. Some airlines have ‘code share’ agreements with other airlines. So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’), but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. While you’re booking your Flight, you’ll be informed if it’s a ‘code share’ Flight.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Airline prohibited practices</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter &#x27;point-beyond ticketing&#x27;, &#x27;hidden-city ticketing&#x27; or &#x27;back-to-back ticketing&#x27; into a search engine.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. When you purchase a Flight, you agree not to do this. If you do this in breach of the airline’s terms (provided when you make your Booking), you will reimburse us for any difference between the cost of your actual journey and the cost of the full journey specified on your ticket(s) if the airline claims this from us.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Use of flight segments</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. If your airline does allow you to ‘skip’ any Flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the Flight(s) you don’t want, in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">One-way tickets</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. If you buy two one-way tickets rather than a single round-trip ticket:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you’ll be making two separate Bookings, each with its own rules and policies</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>any changes to one Flight will not affect the other (for example, if your initial Flight is cancelled, you won’t be guaranteed a refund for your second Flight).</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8.

You may be responsible for dealing with any retroactive change in the tax rate.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Service fees</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">10.

Your airline may charge for checked baggage, excess/overweight baggage, priority boarding, allocated seating, onboard entertainment, food and drink and/or airport check-in.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">13. If they do, the charge(s) will be on top of the price of your ticket (unless it’s expressly stated that your Flight included the extra(s)).</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">International travel</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">14.

It’s not a common practice, but international law allows ‘disinsection’ of aircraft to kill insects. To do this, personnel might spray the aircraft’s cabin with an aerosolised insecticide while passengers are on board, or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they’re not on board. Before you travel, we advise you to find out about disinsection, including where it might happen.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">Entry/exit fees</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">17. Your fare will not include any fee that a country or airport charges people entering/leaving the country and that is collected directly at the airport. Before you travel, we advise you to find out if you’ll have to pay this kind of fee.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">UK: Your financial protection</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">18. <strong>ATOL Holder:</strong> Booking.com B.V.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">19. <strong>ATOL Licence Number:</strong> 11967</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">20.

We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">23. If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be reassigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.</p><h4 class="c472f11c0e">EU: Passengers&#x27; rights under EU Regulation 261/2004</h4><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">24.

If you get any Credits or Credit Card Cashbacks in another currency, we’ll convert them to your default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">18. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Credits that haven’t been used will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">19. We reserve the right to cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">20.

Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4.

When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you should inform the Service Provider</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further*.</div></li></ul></div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>5. There’s a limit (which is shown while you’re booking) to how much the Service Provider can charge you under the damage policy through our Platform.</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>6. Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>7. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>8. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>* If there is any damage, the Service Provider can always decide to initiate a (legal) claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit (see 5 above) wouldn’t apply.</div></li></ul><h5 class="aad40553e8">How We Work</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9.

You must read and agree to comply with these Terms and the Rental Agreement - and acknowledge that if you breach them:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>you might have to pay additional charges</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>your Booking might be cancelled</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the counter staff might refuse to hand over the keys at the rental counter.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. You must check your Rental&#x27;s specific requirements, as many details (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per Rental. So please make sure you carefully read:</p><ul class="b3605c5e50 fa5fd89089"><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>these Terms</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you&#x27;ll see while you’re booking, and</div></li><li class="e1fbf4ac86 b6c8e29a53 e8ee0979c2 aac7c904fd"><div>the Rental Agreement itself, which you&#x27;ll receive at Pick-up.</div></li></ul><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time: if you’re late, the car may no longer be available, and you won’t be entitled to a refund. If you think you might be late, it&#x27;s vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it&#x27;s because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit (in the Service Provider’s opinion) to drive the car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. You must have all the documents (such as ID, voucher and driving licence) that you need at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. You must show the counter staff each driver&#x27;s full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, please let us know as soon as possible, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence" class="dba1b3bddf d371fb5186 e2ebd44c68"><span>licence &#x27;check code&#x27;</span></a> no more than 21 days before Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">10. You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving licence. Note that all drivers must carry their driving licence (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">11. You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">12.

For details of our payment process, please see ‘Payment’ (A7) above.</p><h5 class="aad40553e8">Additional costs and fees</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver&#x27;s age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell you if it’s possible, and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it&#x27;s vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">5. The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They&#x27;ll tell you how much this would cost, and you&#x27;ll enter a new contract with them directly. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.</p><h5 class="aad40553e8">Extras</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. In some cases, you&#x27;ll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8.

You can make changes to your Booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app - or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">8. If changing your Booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.</p><h5 class="aad40553e8">Changes made by us</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">9. If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don&#x27;t accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).</p></section><section class="e88d6bd51f"><h4 class="c472f11c0e" id="nov2021_terms_cars_know_subheading">D7. What else do you need to know?</h4><h5 class="aad40553e8">General</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">1. In all cases, drivers must be at least a minimum age to rent or drive a car. In some cases, they must also be below a maximum age. The limit(s) can vary by Service Provider, by location and by type of car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2. Only eligible drivers whose names appear on the Rental Agreement may drive the car.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">3.

When you make a Booking, it’s directly with the airline. We’re not a ‘contractual party’ to your Booking.

So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’), but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">2.

Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter &quot;point-beyond ticketing&quot;, &quot;hidden-city ticketing&quot; or &quot;back-to-back ticketing&quot; into a search engine.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">4.

Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.</p><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">6. If your airline does allow you to ‘skip’ any Flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the Flight(s) you don’t want, in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.</p><h5 class="aad40553e8">One-way tickets</h5><p class="e2585683de c7df4ed226">7.

They’re responsible for making sure it’s accurate and up to date.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_we_para_1":"1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Accommodations – and you can search for, compare and book them.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_we_para_2":"2.

If you cancel a non-refundable booking, or don’t show up, the Service Provider is entitled to a reasonable compensation, being a lump-sum compensation amount of 90% of the price of the reservation.

Some of the price reductions you see are funded by us, not by the Service Provider. We simply pay some of the cost ourselves.","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_4":"4.

The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).","nov2021_terms_accommodations_know_para_8":"8. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’.
