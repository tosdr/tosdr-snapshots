Additional terms and conditions may apply when you use the services of service providers and others. These additional terms will not reduce, diminish, or eliminate any rights Magoosh possesses with respect to these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<h3>16. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Any failure by Magoosh to exercise any rights or enforce any of the terms of these Terms and Conditions of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or terms. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions of Use or its application in a particular circumstance is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of these Terms and Conditions of Use, or the application of such provision in other circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h3>17. Plan Period</h3>
<p>You will be entitled to receive the Service only during the plan period ("Plan Period") specified by your payment confirmation.</p>
<h3>18. Payment Terms</h3>

Fees are non-refundable and non-transferable, unless otherwise stated in our Money Back Guarantee Policy. Accordingly, if you elect to cancel your access to the Service during the Period, you will not receive a refund of the Fee(s) previously paid to Magoosh, unless otherwise stated in our Money Back Guarantee Policy.</p>
<h3>19. Arbitration</h3>
<p>
19.1 Agreement to Arbitrate. This Section 19 is referred to herein as the "Arbitration
Agreement." The parties that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes between you
and Magoosh arising out of, relating to, or resulting from this Agreement, shall be subject
to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement,
and not any court action (other than a small claims court action to the extent the claim
qualifies). The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>
19.2 Class Action Waiver. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
</p>
<p>
19.3 Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") rules and procedures (the "AAA Rules"),
as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA
Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control
unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must
also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including without limitation,
the limitation of liability provisions in Section 8. You may visit http://www.adr.org for
information on the AAA and http://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a
claim against the Magoosh.
</p>
<p>
19.4 Venue. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another
mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or
Magoosh may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
submissions, which election shall be binding on each party, but subject to the arbitrator's
discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any
in-person hearing may be made by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator
requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
19.5 Governing Law. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and
will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Service users, but is bound by rulings in
prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
19.6 Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
(collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA's Rules.  Each party
will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration,
including without limitation, all attorney fees.
</p>
<p>
19.7 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision
or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
</p>
<p>
19.8 Severability. If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
Agreement other than Section 19.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that
any of the provisions of Section 19.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of this Agreement will continue
to apply.
</p>
<h3>20. Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>
<p>The failure of Magoosh to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions of Use remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>21. Electronic Communications</h3>
<p>When you visit this website and when you communicate with us electronically, for example by sending us an email or ordering our products online, you consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on this website. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>
<h3>22.  Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>You consent to the collection, processing and storage by Magoosh of your personal information in accordance with the terms of Magoosh’s Privacy Policy, which is available at www.magoosh.com/privacy. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and the terms of Magoosh’s Privacy Policy, with respect to any access, use and/or submission by you of any personal information in connection with this web site.</p>
