This confirms to the member of staff who raised the matter that their legal obligation to report has been fulfilled.

AC Group’s owner will have the final decision on whether to make a formal disclosure to the authorities.</li><li>All members of staff, anywhere in AC Group, shall respond in full to all enquiries made by the Compliance Officer for the purposes of evaluating a suspicion report.

Neither commercial considerations nor the difficulty in responding to the enquiries of the persons registered on the platform on the matter shall be permitted to take precedence over AC Group’s legal obligations in this regard.</p><h3>CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h3><ul><li>As soon as a member of staff forms or becomes aware of a suspicion of money laundering, the registered account will be blocked.</li><li>If there is any likelihood of the awareness that the registered account has been blocked, for example because an anticipated transaction has not gone through, the member of staff concerned must contact the Compliance Officer for instructions on how to handle the matter.</li><li>On receipt of a suspicion report, the Compliance Officer shall instruct the originator of the report and any other staff involved to block the registered account giving rise to suspicion</li><li>When an registered account has been blocked, the Compliance Officer shall carry out the evaluation of the suspicion report as quickly as possible to decide whether a disclosure must be made to the authorities.</li><li>If the Compliance Officer decides that there are not reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, he or she will give consent for continuing the registered account on his or her own authority.</li><li>If the Compliance Officer decides that a disclosure must be made, he or she will request consent to continue from the AC Group’s owner as quickly as possible.
