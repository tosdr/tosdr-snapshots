This confirms to the member of staff who raised the matter that their legal obligation to report has been fulfilled. (reporting procedure format)</li><li>In the circumstance where any member of staff forms a suspicion of money laundering but the responsible AC Officer does not agree that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, the member of staff forming the suspicion must fulfil their legal obligation by submitting a money laundering suspicion report to the Compliance Officer , in the format specified by the Compliance Officer for that purpose.

This log shall be held securely and shall not form part of the Platform User account.</li><li>Following receipt of a report, the Compliance Officer shall gather all relevant information held within AC Group, and make all appropriate enquiries of members of staff anywhere in AC Group, in order properly to evaluate the report. The Compliance Officer shall then decide whether they personally believe there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, and make a decision on AC Group’s obligation to make a formal disclosure to the authorities.</li><li>Before actually making a formal disclosure to the authorities, the Compliance Officer will have to seek advice from AC Group’s owner. AC Group’s owner will have the final decision on whether to make a formal disclosure to the authorities.</li><li>All members of staff, anywhere in AC Group, shall respond in full to all enquiries made by the Compliance Officer for the purposes of evaluating a suspicion report. Information provided to the Compliance Officer in response to such enquiries does not breach any confidentiality/professional privilege, and no member of staff shall withhold information on those grounds.</li><li>If it has been decided that a formal disclosure to the authorities is required, the Compliance Officer shall make such disclosure by the appropriate means.</li><li>The Compliance Officer shall document in the report log the reasons for deciding to make or not to make a formal disclosure.</li><li>The Compliance Officer shall where appropriate inform the originator of the internal report whether or not a formal disclosure has been made.</li><li>The Compliance Officer shall inform all those, and only those, members of staff who need to be aware of the suspicion in order to protect them and AC Group from possible money laundering offences in connection with any related business.</li><li>Following a formal disclosure, the Compliance Officer shall take such actions as required by the authorities in connection with the disclosure.</li></ul><h2>POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR BLOCKING/CONTINUING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRED ON THE PLATFORM FOLLOWING A SUSPICION REPORT</h2><h3>POLICY</h3><p>It is the policy of AC Group that from the moment a suspicion of money laundering arises, the registered account will be blocked. Neither commercial considerations nor the difficulty in responding to the enquiries of the persons registered on the platform on the matter shall be permitted to take precedence over AC Group’s legal obligations in this regard.</p><h3>CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h3><ul><li>As soon as a member of staff forms or becomes aware of a suspicion of money laundering, the registered account will be blocked.</li><li>If there is any likelihood of the awareness that the registered account has been blocked, for example because an anticipated transaction has not gone through, the member of staff concerned must contact the Compliance Officer for instructions on how to handle the matter.</li><li>On receipt of a suspicion report, the Compliance Officer shall instruct the originator of the report and any other staff involved to block the registered account giving rise to suspicion</li><li>When an registered account has been blocked, the Compliance Officer shall carry out the evaluation of the suspicion report as quickly as possible to decide whether a disclosure must be made to the authorities.</li><li>If the Compliance Officer decides that there are not reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, he or she will give consent for continuing the registered account on his or her own authority.</li><li>If the Compliance Officer decides that a disclosure must be made, he or she will request consent to continue from the AC Group’s owner as quickly as possible.
