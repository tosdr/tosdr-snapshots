      Bit "farming" is considered fraudulent in our virtual economy. Bit "farming" is when users or members create alternative accounts to acquire starting currency from said accounts for personal or non-personal gain. All item sales are reviewed by both automated and human processes to check for fraudulent activity. ALL sales on end-of-day payouts may be indefinitely held if bit farming is detected. This means that all profits from a single item may be indefinitely held regardless of the amount bit farmed. Accounts linked with bit "farming" will be terminated from our website.
