Without them, Forbes may not be able to provide core Property functions and features to you,\n            and the\n            Property would not operate as well as you or Forbes would like. For example, they enable core functions like\n            carrying\n            out network transmissions and enabling you to log in to our systems.

We use industry standard physical,\n    electronic, and organizational safeguards to protect your user information against loss or theft as well as\n    unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy. We employ many different security techniques to protect\n    such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside of the company. We also ensure that, in accordance\n    with good industry practice, we have in place security measures to protect your personal information from\n    interception, including in transit between our different systems and devices. This includes having in place network\n    protection to deny attackers the ability to intercept data and the encryption of your personal information while in\n    transit to deny attackers the ability to read data.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it's important to keep in mind that no data transmission on the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure.\n    If you are concerned that your privacy may have been breached or that your interaction with us is no longer secure,\n    please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as provided below.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"data-retention\">DATA RETENTION</h4>\n\n<p>We will retain your user information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to use your user\n    information (for example you have an active account with us or to comply with applicable tax, legal, or accounting\n    requirements). When there is no longer such a need, we will delete it or, if this is not possible (for example,\n    because your personal information has been stored in back-up archives), then we will securely store your personal\n    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar\n    technologies described above may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a\n    particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with\n    information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called \"targeted advertising,\" \"behavioral\n    advertising,\" or \"cross-context behavioral advertising,\" enables us and our vendors to know your interests in\n    connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see\n    advertisements that are relevant to your interests. We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online\n    Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). If you would like to opt out of\n    these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under <em><strong>Your\n            Choices</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p><strong>Cross Device Matching</strong></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We may use information we have collected to help us, or our third-party vendors, determine if you have interacted\n    with our Properties across multiple devices and to match such devices. To accomplish this, we may rely on\n    information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors,\n    pursuant to their own privacy policies, or we may use information we collect in conjunction with such third-party\n    data. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated\n    and may provide other services to our advertisers to better enable cross-device targeting and analysis. For further\n    instructions on restricting our use of certain cross-device data, please see Your Choices below.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"your-choices\">YOUR CHOICES</h4>\n\n<p>Consistent with applicable law, you may exercise the options described in this section regarding your choices with\n    respect to your personal information and communications from us.

Additionally, be advised that these industry opt-out methods will not prevent the receipt of\n    interest-based advertising\n    from other companies that do not participate in these programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>Cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if\n    you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device, and if you opt\n    out on one of your devices, that opt out may not be effective on all of your devices.</p>\n\n<p>If you are visiting our Properties from a mobile device, the operating system of the device may offer you options\n    regarding how the\n    device collects and uses your information for interest-based advertising.

For targeted advertisements delivered through mobile apps, you can install the DAA's\n    AppChoices app on your\n    device to opt out of targeted advertising by certain providers, and can also select a system-level advertising\n    preference on\n    your device (such as \"Limit Ad Tracking\" on Apple devices or \"Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads\" on Android\n    devices).\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While some browsers have a \"do not track\" (also known as DNT) feature that lets you instruct websites not to track\n    your online activities, we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web\n    browsers. However, in jurisdictions where required, our Properties are designed to honor opt-out preference (aka,\n    Global Privacy Control)\n    signals.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRIVACY DISCLOSURES FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt out of the sale of certain personal information to third\n    parties who intend to license or sell that personal information.

If you submit personal information to Forbes, your personal information may be processed in a foreign\n    country where\n    privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By submitting your personal information to us you\n    agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information in a country other than your country of\n    residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States. Please note that personal information\n    transferred to the United States is subject to access by law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Where applicable, Forbes may use model clauses approved by the laws of your jurisdiction (such as Standard\n    Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission) or other\n    recognized transfer mechanisms for cross-border data transfers. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"law-enforcement-requests\">LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS</h4>\n\n<p>Forbes takes the protection of your personal information very seriously and is committed to acting as a responsible\n    data custodian. If we become aware that any law enforcement, regulatory, judicial or governmental authority\n    (\"Authority\")\n    wishes to obtain access to, or a copy of, the personal information that we hold about you (whether on a voluntary or\n    mandatory basis) (a \"Request\"), then we commit to the following: (1) we will investigate the Request\n    before responding, to ensure that it is a valid request made under applicable law; and (2) we will only disclose\n    personal information to the Authority in response to the Request where we are legally required to do so and in\n    accordance with applicable lawful process. The only exception to these commitments is where we reasonably believe\n    (in good faith) that the urgent provision of the requested personal information per the Authority's Request is\n    necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual. However, in any event, we shall never\n    knowingly disclose personal information in a massive, disproportionate, or indiscriminate manner, which goes beyond\n    what is necessary in a democratic society.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"children-privacy\">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>\n\n<p>The Properties are intended for people who are at least 16 years of age. If you are less than 16 years old, please do\n    not send any personal information to us—including information such as your name, address, or email address. We\n    do not knowingly collect (nor do we wish to collect) any personal information from children under the age of 16. If\n    we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete that\n    information from our database and terminate the corresponding account, if any. We encourage you to discuss the\n    Properties with your parent or guardian.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"notice-of-financial-incentive\">NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE</h4>\n\n<p>We may at times offer our customers programs that provide certain perks associated with us, such as rewards and\n    exclusive offers.\n    We may also provide other programs, such as sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotional campaigns\n    (collectively, the “Programs”).\n    When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such\n    as email address\n    and/or telephone number). If participating in a program that requires signing up or logging in with a digital\n    wallet, we may also\n    require certain public data like your wallet address, the blockchain your wallet is on, your wallet’s transactions\n    and transaction\n    history, and whether your wallet holds a Forbes digital collectible. Because our Programs involve the collection of\n    Personal\n    Information, they\n    may be considered a “financial incentive” program under California law or a “bona fide loyalty program” under\n    Colorado law. The value\n    of your personal information to us is exceeded by or related to the value of the free or discounted products or\n    services, or other\n    benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program, minus the expense related to\n    offering those products,\n    services, and benefits to Program participants. Unless specifically stated otherwise in connection with a potential\n    “financial\n    incentive,” the value of the benefit Forbes may offer to you exceeds the value of the personal information you\n    provide as a\n    participant.</p>\n\n<p>You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth\n    in the\n    applicable Program rules.

This section describes the rights\n    that California consumers have and explains how to exercise those rights. For the purposes of this section,\n    \"<strong>Personal Information</strong>\" does not include: (i) information that is lawfully made available from\n    federal, state or local government records; (ii) de-identified or aggregated data; or (iii) information excluded\n    from the scope of the CCPA. To be clear, these rights are granted only to the extent that you are a California\n    consumer. The rights in this section are not intended to grant you additional rights, but only your rights under the\n    CCPA to the extent that we are considered a CCPA business with respect to the applicable Personal Information.</p>\n\n<p>In order to provide our Services to our clients, we may process Service Data that we receive from or on behalf of our\n    clients. If you are a California resident, you may have certain CCPA rights pertaining to such information. Under\n    the CCPA, when we act as a \"service provider\" (not as a \"business\" or a \"third party\") over such information, we\n    only process your information through our Services as necessary to provide our services to our clients, at our\n    clients' direction. If you wish to exercise any of your rights under CCPA regarding such information, please contact\n    the relevant business that collected the information from you, who controls and determines how your information is\n    processed.</p>\n\n<p><u><em>Information We Collect; How We Collect It; How We Use It</em></u></p>\n\n<p>To the extent that our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information is addressed by a separate privacy\n    notice,\n    please consult the terms of that privacy notice for detailed information about our data practices, including the\n    categories of\n    personal information that we collect and disclose. For all other consumers, general information regarding our\n    collection, use, and\n    disclosure of personal information is set forth in the Privacy Statement, and more detailed information about our\n    data practices in\n    relation to specific categories of personal information can be found in the\n    <b id=\"#personal-information-processing-chart\"><a href=\"#personal-information-processing-chart\">Personal Information\n            Processing Chart</a></b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to service providers for a business purpose, or sell or share your personal\n    information\n    to third parties, subject to your right to opt out (see <b>Right to Opt Out of Selling or Sharing Your Personal\n        Information</b>,\n    below).

Forbes is committed to applying the EU-U.S. DPF's applicable Principles to personal data we\n    receive from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and to personal data we receive from the United\n    Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension. Likewise, Forbes is committed to applying the Swiss-U.S.\n    DPF's applicable Principles to personal data we receive from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. For\n    clarity, Forbes will only rely on the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as transfer mechanisms under the\n    applicable UK and Swiss data protection laws, once respectively (i) the adequacy regulations implementing the data\n    bridge for the UK Extension enter into force; and (ii) the Swiss Federal Administration's recognition of adequacy of\n    the Swiss-U.S. DPF enters into force.\n    If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF\n    Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, and to view\n    our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.\n    Forbes is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each DPF, and subsequently transfers to\n    a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.\n    Forbes complies with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data we receive from the European\n    Union, the UK, Gibraltar, and Switzerland in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the UK Extension and/or the\n    Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In particular, where we have received\n    your personal information in the United States in reliance upon the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the UK Extension and/or\n    the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles and we subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting as an agent, and\n    such third party agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with those Principles, we will\n    remain responsible unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n    With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the DPFs, Forbes is subject to the regulatory\n    enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Forbes may be required to disclose\n    personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law\n    enforcement requirements. Forbes\n    commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in\n    reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an\n    alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be\n            relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have\n            requested information from us or used our services and, in each case, you have consented to our use of your\n            personal data for marketing purposes.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Data Subject Rights</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are situated in the European Union, Switzerland, or the UK, under the GDPR, as a data subject, you have the\n    right to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This\n            enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully\n            processing it.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or\n            inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you\n            provide to us.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where\n            there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or\n            remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see\n            below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your\n            personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your\n            request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of\n            your request.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third\n            party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing\n            on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to\n            object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may\n            demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your\n            rights and freedoms.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing\n            of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;\n            (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold\n            the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or\n            (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate\n            grounds to use it.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third\n            party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that\n            this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where\n            we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this\n            will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you\n            withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
