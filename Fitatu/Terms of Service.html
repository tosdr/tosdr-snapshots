                The creation of an Account requires Registration via the Application or the Website. For Registration,
                the registration form has to be completed by providing email address and password. The email address
                provided by the User will be used as login, and the password will secure access to the Account.
            </li> <li>
                The User may also set up an Account via the Facebook social network by using the login button and
                agreeing to link the Facebook account social network to the Account. On subsequent logins to
                the Facebook social network account, the User will have the option to automatically connect to
                the Account.
            </li> <li>
                The User accesses his/her Account by logging in to the Application or on the Website, i.e.
                by entering his/her login, which is the email address stated during the Registration, and the
                password securing access to the Account.
            </li> <li>
                From the first logging in to the Application or the Website, the User must complete Account data
                about himself/herself (sex, weight, age, physical activity, etc.) necessary for the correct
                performance of the Services. We undertake to protect these data with particular care. The User
                may also block access to them at any time by deleting the Account. Failure to provide certain
                information may result in Fitatu's inability to provide specific Services.
            </li> <li>
                The password securing access to the User Account should not be shared with third parties. All
                activities carried out through the Account shall be deemed to have been carried out by the owner
                of that Account, so in the case of suspicion that the password securing access to the Account
                has been taken by someone else, please inform us immediately.
            </li> <li>
                The use of other Users' Accounts or making an Account available to third parties is prohibited.
            </li> <li>
                We reserve the right to block an Account or access to selected services provided as part of
                the Platforms if we determine that the security of the Account is at risk, the provisions of
                the Rules have been violated or the generally applicable laws have been violated. In some cases,
                we may make the continued use of an Account conditional upon a change of the password securing
                access to that Account. In such circumstances, the User will immediately regain access to the
                Account once the password is changed.
            </li> <li>
                The User can delete the Account at any time via the option to do so in the Platform settings.

                The use of the Platforms for the Free Services does not entail any obligation to pay any fees
                to Fitatu. The costs and detailed rules for the provision of Paid Services are described
                in Section VII.
            </li> <li>
                The User may post Materials on the Platforms. Materials should be accurate, reliable and not
                misleading.
            </li> <li>
                Fitatu reserves the right to moderate and remove Material that does not comply with these Rules,
                in particular when:
                <ol type="a"><li>
                        their content is contrary to the law, ethical standards and good morals,
                    </li> <li>
                        there is advertising content in the Materials, including advertisements for companies,
                        products, websites or other online platforms,
                    </li> <li>
                        they promote sexually explicit content, including by implementing or providing paid
                        functions that mainly encourage the sharing of controversial content,
                    </li> <li>
                        they contain threats, attempts to harass or tease (especially in relation to minors),
                    </li> <li>
                        their main purpose is to harass or isolate a specific person in order to abuse, attack or
                        ridicule them.
                    </li></ol></li> <li>
                The User accepts that he/she is granted access to the Platforms and Fitatu proceeds to provide
                the Paid Services immediately.
            </li> <li>
                As far as Paid Services are concerned, Fitatu provides them immediately, nevertheless receiving
                access to the purchased functionalities involves the necessary time for their generation. However,
                this time does not exceed 3 days.
            </li> <li>
                The User may unsubscribe from the Services at any time without incurring any additional costs.
                The preceding sentence shall not apply to contracts concluded for a fixed period (one-off payment).
                In order to unsubscribe from Paid Services, the User must first unsubscribe from the relevant
                subscription or prepaid service. The deletion of the Account is not the same as the cancellation
                of Paid Services.

            </a></p> <h2>VII. Paid Services</h2> <ol class="digits"><li>
                As part of the Paid Services, Fitatu allows Users to purchase the following Subscription plans:
                <ol type="a"><li>Fitatu Premium or</li> <li>Fitatu Premium + AI</li></ol></li> <li>
                The additional functionalities of the individual Subscription plans are stated each time within the
                offer presented to the User prior to the conclusion of the contract for the provision of Paid Services.
                The current functionalities of the Subscription plans are available in the table in Section III
                of these Terms and Conditions.
            </li> <li>
                The contract for the provision of a Paid Service may be concluded for an indefinite period or for a fixed period.
                Information is available in the Application on the Paid Services offer page and on the Website at
                <a href="/app/order-and-payment" target="_blank" class="link">www.fitatu.com/app/order-and-payment</a>.
                A contract for a fixed period is concluded if a plan with a single payment is selected. A contract for an indefinite
                period is concluded if a subscription plan is selected. Plans with a single payment (contract for a fixed period)
                can only be used by the User via the Website.
            </li> <li>
                The availability of Paid Services depends on the language version of the Google Play platform or AppStore from where
                the App was downloaded and can be verified in the settings.
            </li> <li>
                A contract for the provision of a Paid Service concluded for an indefinite period of time may be terminated
                at any time with effect at the end of the period that has already been paid for at the latest 24 hours before
                the end of the paid period. The notice of termination shall be submitted via the third party
                (i.e. the provider of the Google Play, AppStore or other platform) that mediated the conclusion of the contract
                for the provision of the Paid Service or the processing of the payment.
            </li> <li>
                A contract for the provision of a Paid Service concluded for a limited period of time may not be terminated
                before the end of the period for which it was concluded. The User's submission of a declaration
                to the above effect shall not result in an obligation to refund payments made by the User.
            </li> <li>The preceding provisions do not exclude the statutory right of withdrawal, which is regulated in point XIII below.</li> <li>
                Payment for the use of the Paid Service can be made via Google Play, the AppStore, the Service or Apps provided
                by other intermediaries for the conclusion of the contract for the provision of the Paid Service and the processing
                of payments.
            </li> <li>
                If, for reasons other than solely attributable to the User, the Paid Service Agreement is terminated or
                expires or it is no longer possible to continue to provide the Paid Service, the User shall be entitled
                to a refund of the price paid in proportion to the time of the Paid Service paid for and remaining until
                the end of that Agreement.
            </li> <li>
                Fitatu itself or through a third party, i.e. the Google Play platform provider, AppStore will refund the
                price within a maximum of 14 days from the date such obligation arises.
            </li> <li>
                The User has the option to change the type of Subscription from Fitatu Premium to Fitatu Premium+AI
                and vice versa during the term of one of them. Changing the type of Subscription involves the termination
                of the previous Paid Service Agreement for an indefinite period and the conclusion of a new Paid Service Agreement
                for an indefinite period.
            </li> <li>
                If the User wishes to change the Subscription formula, he/she must do so via the originally selected payment method,
                i.e. via the Google Play app, the AppStore or the Service.
            </li> <li>
                If you change your Subscription type via the Google Play app, unused funds from the previous Subscription type will be recalculated
                according to the new Subscription amount and will adjust the length of the existing Subscription.
            </li> <li>
                With regard to changing the type of Subscription via the AppStore app:
                <ol type="a"><li>in the event of a change of Subscription from Fitatu Premium to Fitatu Premium+AI,
                        the User shall pay for the new Subscription formula and any unused funds from the
                        previous Subscription formula shall be proportionally recalculated and returned to the User,
                    </li> <li>
                        in the event of a change of Subscription from Fitatu Premium+AI to Fitatu Premium, the new Subscription
                        formula will start after the end of the existing period depending on the subscription plan selected by the User.
                    </li></ol></li> <li>
                Fitatu reserves that the method for calculating and crediting the unused credit from the previous Subscription formula
                to the new formula depends on the technical and procedural solutions adopted in this respect in Google Play and the AppStore.
                Nevertheless, the resulting differences referred to in the preceding sentence shall not adversely affect the User.
                Details in this respect are available in Google Play and the AppStore respectively.
            </li> <li>
                In the event of a change of the Subscription formula via the Service by the User, Fitatu shall settle the unused funds
                from the previously used Subscription formula to the new Subscription formula on a pro-rata basis by extending
                the duration of the newly selected Subscription formula accordingly, immediately charging the entire monetary amount
                for the new Subscription formula to the User.
            </li> <li>The change of the Subscription formula referred to in points 11 to 17 above shall not apply to Paid Services Contracts concluded for a fixed period.</li> <li>The Paid Service constitutes a Digital Service and all provisions of section 5b of the Act apply to it.</li></ol> <p><a class="link fl--r">

                The use of the Services available on the Platforms and the published data for purposes other than

                If the Digital Content or Digital Service does not comply with the Contract, Fitatu may make

                value of the Digital Content or Digital Service which is in conformity with the Contract. If the
                Contract provides that the Digital Content or Digital Service is provided in parts or on a
                continuous basis, the reduced price must take into account the time during which the Digital
                Content or Digital Service has remained inconsistent with the Contract.
            </li> <li>
                Fitatu shall reimburse the price due as a result of the exercise of the right of withdrawal or
                price reduction immediately, but no later than within 14 days of receipt of the User's declaration
                of withdrawal or price reduction. The preceding provision shall not apply to payments through the
                Application Distributor in the form of Apple, due to the separate return method that operates at
                this Distributor. Fitatu shall make every effort to ensure Users' rights, but cannot directly
                influence the operation of this method of payment and returns.
            </li> <li>
                The User may not cancel the Contract if the Digital Content or Digital Service is provided in
                exchange for the payment of a price and the non-conformity of the Digital Content or Digital
                Service with the Contract is not material. The non-conformity of the Digital Content or Digital
                Service with the Contract shall be presumed to be material.
            </li> <li>
                If the non-conformity with the Contract relates only to some of the Services supplied under
                the Contract, the User may withdraw from the Contract only in respect of those Services.
            </li> <li>
                Fitatu shall refund the price using the same method of payment used by the User, unless the User
                has expressly agreed to a different method of refund that does not incur any costs for the User.
            </li> <li>
                Fitatu may make a change to the Digital Content or Digital Service that is not necessary to comply
                with the Contract only if the Contract so provides and only for the legitimate reasons indicated
                in the contract. Fitatu shall not make changes to Digital Content or Digital Service provided on a
                one-off basis.
            </li> <li>
                If the change referred to in the preceding paragraph materially and adversely affects the User's
                access to or use of the Digital Content or Digital Service, Fitatu shall inform the User of its
                right to terminate the Contract without notice within 30 days of the change.
            </li> <li>
                The User's entitlement under the preceding paragraph shall not apply if Fitatu has provided the
                User with the entitlement to retain, at no additional cost, the Digital Content or Digital Services
                in an unaltered state.
            </li> <li>
