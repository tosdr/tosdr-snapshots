This is done with the help of Ad Server Cookies, which can be used to measure certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users.

These cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to identify the user personally.

This also revokes consent to its dispatch by the marketing automation provider and ends the statistical analyses. Separate revocation of dispatch or statistical evaluations by the marketing automation service provider is unfortunately not possible. This means that if a user does not wish that its personal data for statistical analysis, the user must terminate the newsletter.

Third-Party Services and Contents</span></b></p><p><span lang="EN-US">On the basis of our legitimate interests (interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website within the meaning of art. 6 (1) lit. f. GDPR), contents and service offers from third parties are used within our website to integrate their contents and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Content”). This always assumes that the third-party providers can see the users’ IP addresses, since they cannot send the contents to users’ browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required to display the contents. However, we endeavour to only use contents from providers who only use the IP addresses to deliver the respective contents. Third-party providers may also use pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as web beacons) for statistical or marketing purposes. Pixel tags allow information, such as our website’s traffic, to be evaluated. In addition, the pseudonymous information may be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and the operating system, referring websites, time of visit, and other information regarding the use of our website and be linked to such information from other sources.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Users who want to avoid that their visits on our website are connected to social media user accounts must log off before they visit our website and delete the cookies from their device.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The following statement provides an overview of third-party providers as well as their contents and links to their privacy statements, which contain further information on the processing of data as well as opt-out options:</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><p><b><span lang="EN-US">11.1 Facebook Social Plugins</span></b></p><p><span lang="EN-US">11.1.1 On the basis of our legitimate interests (interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of art. 6 (1) lit. f. GDPR), we use social plug-ins ("plug-ins") of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). The plug-ins can display interaction elements or content (e.g., videos, graphics or text contributions) and are recognisable by one of the Facebook logos (e.g., white "f" on a blue tile, the terms "Like", "Like" or a "thumbs up" sign) or are marked with the addition "Facebook Social Plug-In". The list and appearance of Facebook social plug-ins can be viewed at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">11.1.2 When a user calls up a function of our online offer that contains a plug-in, their device establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted by Facebook directly to the user's device and integrated into the online offer by the latter. In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. We have no influence on the scope of the data that Facebook collects with the help of this plug-in and therefore inform users according to our own knowledge.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">11.1.3 By integrating the plug-ins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of our online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to their Facebook account. When users interact with the plug-ins, e.g. by clicking the "Like" button or posting a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from the user's device directly to Facebook and stored there and, if the user is logged into their Facebook account, linked to their Facebook profile. According to Facebook, only an anonymised IP address is stored in Germany.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">11.1.4 The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the relevant rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of the users, can be found in the data protection information of Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
