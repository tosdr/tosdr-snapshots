<p>The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services and to protect our services against malicious activity. The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website.

<p>Log files are automatically deleted after 30 days unless needed as evidence during an abuse investigation.</p>
