<h3><a id="Eleven"></a>11. SECURITY</h3>
<p>There is no perfect security. We have implemented appropriate and commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect Personal Information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any credentials that can be used to access any account or service with Newell Brands. If you should suspect any unauthorized activity, please report this to us immediately. You can report suspicious activity or other concerns by contacting us at <span><a href="/forms/data-privacy-enquiry-form">Data&nbsp; Privacy Enquiry</a></span>.</p>
<h3><a id="Twelve"></a>12. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES</h3>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from the Sites, including the information or content contained within them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing Personal Information to third parties, since any Personal Information disclosed will be subject to the applicable third party&rsquo;s privacy policy.</p>
<h3><a id="Thirteen"></a>13. USING MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES</h3>
<p>Newell Brands, our affiliates and third parties that we have engaged, may collect and store unique identifiers matched to your mobile device to deliver customized ads or content while you use our Sites or navigate the internet to deliver location-based services and advertising, or to identify you in a unique manner across devices or browsers. To customize these ads or content, we, or third parties, may collect Personal Information, e.g., your email address, or data passively collected from you such as your device identifier, location, or IP address. Your mobile devices may allow you to turn off location services or otherwise restrict what data is provided when you use our Sites or navigate the internet.</p>
<p><br />By adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device, you can manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information, as well as how your mobile browser handles Cookies and other tracking identifiers.

<h3><a id="Fourteen"></a>14. EMAIL MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
<p>If, where required by applicable law, you have provided consent, or otherwise if you have not directed us not to send you marketing messages, we may send you marketing messages via email and/or mail to keep you updated on our products and services.<br /><br />You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time through the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through your customer account settings/preferences within &ldquo;My Account&rdquo;</li>

<p>We will process opt-out/unsubscribe requests as quickly as possible in accordance with applicable Privacy Laws, and in most cases, within 10 days. However, Newell Brands consists of many entities and associated service providers so it may take time for all our systems to reflect these updates. We ask for your understanding that during this period you may still get messages from us while your request is being processed.&nbsp; Please note that when you unsubscribe from our marketing email there may be a delay in the discontinuation of our ads directed to you on third party sites.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please note that the discontinuation of marketing messages will not stop any service communications such as order updates.</p>
<h3><a id="Fifteen"></a>15. TEXT MESSAGING</h3>
<p>Our Sites may give you the choice to opt-in to receiving text messages and alerts on the mobile phone number(s) you have shared with us. Once you have opted-in, we may send you text messages regarding your account, to investigate or prevent fraud, to alert you in the event of an emergency, etc. We may send you text messages and alerts using autodialing technology. Also, from time to time, we may run certain campaigns that provide you with the ability to send a text message to a specific short code and provide an opt-in to receive future text messages. Your opt-in request provides us with your mobile phone number. If you choose to opt-in, you agree that we may, from time to time, send messages to the mobile device associated with that number about new products, promotions, services, or offers.<br /><br />You may choose to opt-out from our text messages and alerts at any time by replying &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; to the message you received. Once you opt-out, you will not receive any additional text messages via your mobile phone. Please keep in mind that if you opt-out of receiving text messages and alerts we may not be able to contact you with important messages regarding your account or transactions with us. However, if there is an emergency or account question, we will make every attempt to contact you in other ways such as by email or on a landline phone. You do not have to opt-in to text messages and alerts to use our Sites and services. If you opt-in, standard text messaging charges may apply. For more information regarding our text messaging and alerts, please contact us at&nbsp;<span><a href="/forms/data-privacy-enquiry-form">Data Privacy Enquiry</a></span>.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a id="Twenty"></a></span>20. For California Residents Only: Notice of Financial Incentive&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You have the right to receive equal service and price and not be discriminated against for exercising any of your CCPA rights. The CCPA also allows us to offer certain financial incentive programs that may result in different prices, rates, or quality levels when consumers make purchases through these programs. When you sign up for these programs, we will ask you to provide your contact information, email address or phone number to receive messages that include information about the programs. Your contact information, email address and phone number are personal information, and the value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products that you obtain in connection with these programs, and it is based on the expense related to offering those free or discounted products or services. Before we save your contact information, email address and/or phone number to our databases or send you any promotion offer, you will be presented with the opportunity to opt-in to the program. You may withdraw from participating in these programs at any time.</p>
<p>We may from time to time offer rewards programs, benefits, and other offerings to consumers related to the collection, retention, or sale of Personal Information that may be deemed a &ldquo;financial incentive&rdquo; or &ldquo;price or service difference&rdquo; under the CCPA.</p>
<p>We are providing you with this information so that you may make an informed decision on whether to participate in our programs.</p>
<p>Examples of the programs we may offer include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reward Program - </strong>&nbsp;We may offer a program where customers can earn rewards, accumulate points on purchases, and discounts on purchases. As part of the program, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and date of birth.</li>
<li><strong>One-Time Promotions -</strong>&nbsp;We may offer you one-time percentage off coupons, discounts, or other promotions from time to time, such as when you provide us your email address and agree to receive marketing emails in exchange for a one-time coupon or when you provide an email address as a referral. Such offers may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such offers will be presented to you at the time of the offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of the benefits we provide to you via these programs depends on various factors, including the benefits and insights that we realized when you use our services and buy our products, sales generated from participation in our programs, whether the sales generated by our programs exceed the costs to us of offering such programs, how many consumers sign up for our programs, and increased goodwill generated from provision of our programs.</p>
<p>Participation in our promotional programs is always optional, and you can terminate program participation at any time as explained in the applicable program terms, or by contacting us at <span><a href="/forms/data-privacy-enquiry-form">Data Privacy Enquiry</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>We may communicate with you via an automated online account where all or substantially all of the actions or posts of that account are not the result of a person (a &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo;).&nbsp; We may use such Chatbots to help provide you service and address your queries.&nbsp; Such Chatbot features may also record any conversations between you and the Chatbot to help ensure we are best serving you and other users.</p>
