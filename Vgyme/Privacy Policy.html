			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>This Privacy Policy has been created to allow you, the user/visitor, to better understand how the data we collect is used on our website, vgy.me.</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				<strong>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</strong>
			</h4>
			<p>We collect IP addresses and what pages/uploads a user has visited. The purpose of this is to understand where most of our traffic comes from so we can provide a better service in terms of speed, performance and loading times.</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				<strong>When do we collect information?</strong>
			</h4>
			<p>We collect information when you register as a user on our website, where we ask for a username and e-mail address.</p>
			<p>We collect feedback/suggestions which can help improve the website for all.</p>
			<p>Whenever you visit a page on our website, or when you view an upload, either from our website directly or from a 3rd party (such as a hotlinked image on a forum).</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				<strong>How do we use your information?</strong>
			</h4>
			<p>The information is used solely to improve vgy.me, it is never sold or given to 3rd party providers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you register as a user on our website, we ask for your e-mail address, for the purpose of resetting your password if you have forgotten it. You will also receive an e-mail requesting you to activate your account. This is so we can be sure if you need to reset your password, a new password can be sent to you via e-mail securely.</li>
				<li>In some cases, we may use your e-mail address to check against logs with our mail service - this is usually only the case when a user hasn't received their activation/password reset e-mail. We can check to see why the e-mail wasn't sent and let the user know.</li>
				<li>To improve our website in order to better serve you.</li>
				<li>To follow up with them after correspondence (live chat, email or phone inquiries), after which any trace of communication is deleted.</li>
				<li>When moderating our site, we may use your information to link to other pieces of information, such as uploads. This is only if a user/IP address has been caught violating our Terms of Service.</li>
				<li>We never add you to a mailing list upon registering to our website, we never send e-mails for marketing purposes.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h4>
				<strong>How do we protect your information?</strong>
			</h4>
			<p>Nobody else has access to your information other than authorised server and site administrators. None of your personal information is displayed publicly on the website, your information can only be seen if you are logged in.</p>
			<p>We do occasional audits of our site and server security, as well as keeping software as up to date as possible, to ensure any vulnerabilities have been patched.</p>
			<br />
