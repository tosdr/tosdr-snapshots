service.  If you don't accept these terms, you are not permitted to
access this site.  We may revise these Terms of Service from time to time,
so we suggest that you periodically review the most current version.
By continuing to use the service, you accept the terms then in effect.

<p>You may not "hack" the site, violate the copyrights of any of the
material on the site, circumvent or attempt to circumvent passwords or
other technical features meants to protect the site or limit or
control access, harass the site's operators or users, access the site
through automated means that would cause excessive load on our servers
or network connections, or otherwise abuse the site.

<p>We reserve the right to delete user accounts or deny access to any
user, at our sole discretion and without notice.  We may
discontinue the entire service, or any feature of the service, at any
time without notice.

<p>You understand that the site's operators do not routinely review,
filter, or edit the material uploaded by users, and you agree that we
are under no obligation to do so.  The site provides self-serve
publishing features that allow users to post information directly
without any approval or review process.  You agree that any material
you find offensive or objectionable is the sole responsibility of the
user who posted it.  If you encounter material you believe is in
violation of our terms of service, you may report it us (see our
<a href="contact">contact information</a>), but you agree that such a
report creates no obligation of any kind on the site's operators.

<p>The site includes features that let you upload information to be
published on the site. If you use these features, you agree as
follows:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>You retain the copyright to any information you create and upload
to this site.  However, <b>by uploading original material to the site,
you automatically license the material under a <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/"> Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License</a></b>.  (<a
href="whylicense">Why?</a>) You may only upload material that you have
a right to license in this manner.

<li>For the purposes of the Creative Commons license, IFDB will credit
you by your screen name as you set it in your profile, so you should
select a screen name that reflects how you wish to be credited by IFDB
and by anyone who reuses IFDB content under the CC license.

<li>As an exception to the Creative Commons licensing requirement, you
may upload "Cover Art" images without granting the Creative Commons
license described above, <b>provided</b> that the images are otherwise
licensed by their copyright owners in such a way that royalty-free use
of the images on this site is permissible.

<li>You will not upload anything that infringes any copyrights,
trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, anything that's
defamatory or libelous, or anything illegal.  This
includes hyperlinks to illegal material or to sites that traffic in
illegal material.  By uploading information, you warrant that it meets
these requirements and that you have exercised due diligence in
determining that the material is not in violation of these terms.
Furthermore, by uploading information, you <b>indemnify us against
claims</b> arising from our use of the material.

<li>You must not upload images for display on IFDB that are
pornographic, obscene, or indecent. It is permissible to post links
to games containing erotica and images considered legal pornography,
but no pornographic images will be displayed within an IFDB entry,
such as for cover art. The site reserves the right to summarily
remove any media asset violating this rule.

<li>You must not upload information that's inappropriate for the
subject matter of the relevant feature.  You must not upload "spam" or
other off-topic commercial messages, for example.

<li>You agree that we're not obligated to display, publish, or store
anything you upload.  You agree that we may edit, omit, or delete
anything that you upload, at our sole discretion and without notice.

</ul>

<p>Please note that the games cataloged on IFDB are not themselves
within the scope of the Creative Commons license mentioned above.
IFDB doesn't host any games - it only stores metadata (such as
bibliography, reviews, comments, and news items) about games.  The
Creative Commons license only applies to things uploaded to IFDB itself.
The games are covered by their own individual
copyrights and license terms as set by their respective authors.
Inclusion of a game in IFDB in no way affects the game's own copyright
or license terms.

<p>We hope that these terms are fair, reasonable, and easy to understand,
but if you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
