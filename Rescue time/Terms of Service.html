    <h3>1. ACCEPTANCE</h3>
    <p>RescueTime provides its service (&rdquo;Service&rdquo;) to you, subject to  the following Terms of Service (&rdquo;TOS&rdquo;). The TOS tell you what you can  expect from the Service, and what RescueTime expects of you. RescueTime may amend the TOS at any time by posting an amended TOS on our  website.</p>
    <h3>2. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>You must register for a membership in order to access the Service.  When completing the registration form, you will provide true, accurate,  and complete information, and maintain and promptly update this  information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,  or incomplete, or RescueTime has reasonable grounds to suspect that  the information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, RescueTime  has the right to suspend or terminate your membership and access to the  Service. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, which  access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider  charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all  equipment necessary to access the Service. You will enter a password  and login name during the registration process. You are responsible for  maintaining the confidentiality of your password and login name, and  are responsible for all activities that occur with your password and  login name, including fees incurred and all purchases made by your  membership on the Service. This means that, unless your password and  login name, or credit card information is obtained unlawfully or  fraudulently, you will be responsible for all fees incurred and  purchases made by your membership. You will immediately notify RescueTime of any unauthorized use of your membership or any other breach  of security. </p>
    <h3>3. MEMBERSHIP, FEES</h3>
    <p>Individuals may obtain a membership with the Service without paying  a fee. RescueTime will charge fees to access certain components of  the Service. If you must pay a fee to access a component of the  Service, this information will be posted by RescueTime on the  Service. You may use a credit card to pay these fees. When you use a  credit card for payment, you represent to RescueTime that you are  the authorized card holder. For recurring fees, RescueTime will  charge your credit card each month. For one-time fees, RescueTime  will charge your credit card once. RescueTime reserves the right to  change its fees or billing methods. If any change is unacceptable to  you, you may cancel your membership, but RescueTime will not refund  any fees that may have accrued to your membership before you cancel it.  RescueTime may also charge you for any sales or use taxes to which  the Service is subject. </p>
    <h3>4. PROHIBITED USES</h3>
    <p>You agree that you will not:<br>
    impersonate any person, including a  RescueTime employee or agent on the Service; violate any local,  state, or national law through or on the Service; harass people through  or on the Service; collect or store data about other people using the  Service; use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to  interfere with the proper working of the Service; take any action that  imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the  infrastructure of the Service; use the Service in any manner other than  as expressly authorized in the TOS; reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell,  resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the  Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service. </p>
    <h3>5. OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS</h3>
    <p>The license granted in these TOS does not constitute a transfer or  sale of RescueTime&rsquo;s ownership rights in the RescueTime  Database. RescueTime retains all right, title, and interest in and  to the RescueTime Database including all related intellectual  property rights. You will use your best efforts to prevent and protect  the contents of the RescueTime Database from unauthorized use or  distribution. You must not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan,  distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer any content of the service,  including the RescueTime Database, or your rights and obligations  pursuant to the TOS. You must not copy, reproduce, alter, modify,  create derivative works, or publicly display any content of the  Service, including the RescueTime Database, unless expressly  authorized in the TOS. </p>
    <h3>6. CHILDREN</h3>
    <p>By registering, installing, and accepting these TOS you represent to RescueTime that you are at least 13 years old. RescueTime’s policy is to prohibit children under the age of 13 from purchasing, accessing, registering, or using any of RescueTime’s products and services unless under the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. We rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use RescueTime products and services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in this TOS and our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>For teachers or parents, if you want children under the age of 13 to create their own RescueTime accounts, then you (or your school) assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). This means you must notify childrens’ parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the RescueTime products and services the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the RescueTime products and service. Teachers may, under appropriate, circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.</p>
    <h3>7. RescueTime PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <p>Certain registration information and other information about you may  be collected by RescueTime and through the Service. RescueTime&rsquo;s use of this information is governed by the <a href="/privacy">RescueTime  Privacy Policy</a>. </p>
    <h3>8. USER WARRANTY</h3>
    <p>You represent and warrant to RescueTime: (a) that you have full  power, authority, and legal capacity to enter into the Agreements and  follow its obligations, and if you are registering on behalf of a  company or other entity, you have the authority to bind your principal  or employer company; (b) you will provide complete and accurate  information to RescueTime; and (c) you will pay all charges that  you incur at RescueTime&rsquo;s then-current rates. </p>
    <h3>9. INDEMNITY</h3>
    <p>You will indemnify and hold RescueTime, and its subsidiaries,  affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, harmless from any claim or  demand, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, made by any third party  due to or arising out of your use of the Service, your violation of the  TOS, or your violation of any rights of a third party. </p>
    <h3>10. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE</h3>
    <p>RescueTime reserves the right at any time to modify or  discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service or any part of it  with or without notice. RescueTime will not be liable to you or to  any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of  the Service. </p>
    <h3>11. TERMINATION</h3>
    <p>You have the right to terminate or cancel your membership at any  time. You understand and agree that the cancellation of your membership  or a particular component of the Service is your sole right and remedy  with respect to any dispute with RescueTime. This includes, but is  not limited to, any dispute related to or arising out of: (a) any term  of the TOS or RescueTime&rsquo;s enforcement or application of the TOS;  (b) any policy or practice of RescueTime, including the Privacy  Policy, or RescueTime&rsquo;s enforcement or application of these  policies; (c) the data available through the Service; (d) your ability  to access and use the Service; or (e) the amount or type of fees,  surcharges, applicable taxes, and any RescueTime billing methods.  RescueTime, in its sole discretion, may terminate your membership  and remove and discard any of your Recommendations without notice if  RescueTime believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently  with the TOS. RescueTime will not be liable to you for termination  of your membership to the Service. Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16,  and 17 will survive the termination of the TOS and your membership. </p>
    <h3>12. LINKS</h3>
    <p>The Service may provide links to third party web sites. RescueTime has no control over these sites and is not responsible for their  availability, does not endorse them, and is not responsible or liable  for any content, goods, or services available from these sites. RescueTime will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for  any damage or loss caused by or in connection with use of or reliance  on any content, goods, or services available through these sites. </p>
    <h3>13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
    <p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS  PROVIDED ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; BASIS. RescueTime  EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT  RELATED TO THE SERVICE. ANY MATERIAL OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE  OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION  AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS OF  DATA OR EMAIL THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR  INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM RescueTime OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT  EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE  DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER MAY NOT  APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY  ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. </p>
    <h3>14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
    <p>RescueTime WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT  NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR  OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF RescueTime HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RescueTime&rsquo;S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL  KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,  OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY YOU  TO RescueTime IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO  LIABILITY, AND (B) $100. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED  REMEDY IN THE TOS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE  LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </p>
    <h3>15. TRADEMARK INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>RescueTime, the RescueTime logo, and other RescueTime  logos, products and service names are trademarks of RescueTime. You  must not display or use them in any manner. </p>
    <h3>16. ARBITRATION</h3>
    <p>Any legal controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to  the TOS or the Service, excluding legal action taken by RescueTime  to collect fees or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction  relating to, RescueTime&rsquo;s intellectual property or the Service,  will be settled by binding and final arbitration in accordance with the  commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Any controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and  will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or  controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in  King County, Washington, and judgment on the arbitration award may be  entered into any court having jurisdiction. Either you or RescueTime may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of  competent jurisdiction in King County, Washington necessary to protect  the rights or property of you or RescueTime pending the completion  of arbitration. Should either party file an action contrary to this  provision, the other party may recover attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs up to  $1000.00. </p>
    <h3>17. GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>RescueTime may provide notices to you pursuant to the TOS  through email, regular mail, or by displaying conspicuous notices or  links to notices to you on the Service. The TOS constitutes the entire  agreement between you and RescueTime and governs your use of the  Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and RescueTime. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that  may apply when you use other RescueTime products or services. The  TOS and the relationship between you and RescueTime will be  governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its  conflict of law provisions. You consent to the jurisdiction of the  state and federal courts located in King County, Washington. The  failure of RescueTime to exercise or enforce any right or provision  of the TOS will not constitute a waiver of the right or provision. If  any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid, the other provisions  of the TOS will remain in full force and effect. Any claim or cause of  action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must  be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose  or be forever barred.</p>
