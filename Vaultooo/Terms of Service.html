Please note that the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Vault.ooo. By visiting our websites or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read the Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and acknowledging that you have the authority to act on behalf of that organization and commit to these Terms on behalf of that organization. If you do not agree with these Terms or any provisions hereof, please do not install and do not use our Services.<h4 class="heading-4">Updates to Terms</h4>Vault may modify the Terms from time to time. The most recent version is the version that applies to your use of the Services. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the website or via email. Unless it is stated by us otherwise, each update of the Terms comes into force as of the moment when amended Terms are published on this web page. You understand and agree that any continued use and access to the Services after any updates to these Terms are published, means that you voluntarily agree to be bound by the updated Terms.<h4 class="heading-4">Privacy</h4>For information about how we process information about you and your use of our Services, please see our <a href="https://vault-m0h1.pages.dev/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> .<h4 class="heading-4">Risk</h4>Your use of the Services is at your own risk. The Services may be modified, updated, interrupted or suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability for any harm or other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. Vault, its owners, employees, agents and others that are involved with the Services are not in any way or form liable for any harm of any kind executed or intended, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any account registered with Services.<h4 class="heading-4">Payments and Refund</h4>All our paid Services are subscribed on a service period basis. You choose the service period and the payment method yourself when you sign up for the paid Services. We determine your free trial eligibility at our sole discretion, and to the extent permitted under applicable law we may limit or withdraw a free trial option at any time without prior notice. You acknowledge and agree that we will automatically charge you for our paid Services at the end of the free trial period on a recurring basis. If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel the paid subscription before the end of the free trial by contacting our support team. If you received a free trial from a third party, you may also cancel the paid subscription through that third party.<br>If you wish to claim a refund, you can do so within 14 days following your purchase of our Services if you have not uploaded a single file. We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, we would like to troubleshoot an issue you experience first. There are common service configuration issues that may hinder the Services for you, and we resolve most user issues encountered.<br>You can only get a refund for our Services twice. If you buy any of our Services again after that, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation. We do not grant refunds for recurring subscription payments if you cancel the Services after the renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise.
