We take reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of any and/or all personal data that we process. <br/><br/>We regularly review and enhance our technical, physical and managerial procedures to ensure that your personal data is protected from:<br/>• unauthorised access<br/>• improper use or disclosure<br/>• unauthorised modification<br/>• unlawful destruction or accidental loss.<br/><br/>To this end we have implemented security policies, practices, and technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data that we may have under our control. All our members, staff and data processors (including specific subcontractors, including cloud service providers, who may have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data, are further obliged (under contract) to respect the confidentiality of our users’ or clients’ personal data as well as other obligations as imposed by the GDPR. Despite all our efforts, we cannot guarantee that a data transmission or a data storage system can ever be 100% secure. For more information about our security measures, please contact us in the manner described below. <br/><br/>Authorised third parties, and external/third party service providers, with permitted access to your information (as explained in this Privacy Policy) are specifically required to apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures that may be necessary to safeguard the personal data being processed from unauthorised or accidental disclosure, loss or destruction and from any unlawful forms of processing. <br/><br/>These service providers (our data processors) are also bound by a number of other obligations in line with the GDPR (in particular, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/">Article 28</a> of the GDPR). For the avoidance of all doubt, these are the same obligations that we are bound by when acting as data processor on behalf of one or more data controllers.</p><h2 class="heading_h2-legal">Sharing of Personal Data with Third Parties</h2><p class="copy_legal">Relevant data will also be disclosed or shared as appropriate (and in all cases in line with the GDPR) to/with members and staff of Chromatic, to/with affiliated entities and/or subcontractors if pertinent to any of the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy (including to/with our services providers who facilitate the functionality of the site and/or any service you may require). <br/><br/>Personal information will only be shared by us to provide the services you request or for any other lawful reason (including authorised disclosures not requiring your consent). Any such authorised disclosures will be done in accordance with the GDPR (for example all our processors are bound by the requirements of GDPR, including a strict obligation to keep any information they receive confidential and to ensure that their employees/personnel are also bound by similar obligations). <br/><br/>The said service providers (our processors) are also bound by a number of other obligations (in particular, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/">Article 28</a> of the GDPR). Your personal data will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes (unless you explicitly authorise us to do so). The list of third parties to whom we may disclose to and/or share your personal data with is available on request.</p><h2 class="heading_h2-legal">Retention Periods</h2><p class="copy_legal">We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary (taking into consideration the purpose for which it was originally obtained). The criteria we use to determine what is ‘necessary’ depends on the particular personal data in question and the specific relationship we have with you (including its duration).<br/><br/>Our normal practice is to determine whether there is/are any specific EU and/or Estonian law(s) (for example tax or corporate laws) permitting or obliging us to keep certain personal data for a certain period of time (in which case we will keep the personal data for the maximum period indicated by any such law). <br/><br/>For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’ must be kept for at least six years (plus current year). We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or contractual provisions that may be invoked against us by you and/or third parties and if so, what the prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually 6 years, plus current year). In the latter case, we will keep any relevant personal data that we may need to defend ourselves against any claim(s), challenge(s) or other such action(s) by you and/or third parties for such time as is necessary.<br/><br/>Where your personal data is no longer required by us, we will either securely delete or anonymise the personal data in question.</p><h2 class="heading_h2-legal">Processing for Statistical Purposes</h2><p class="copy_legal">We use research and statistics data based on user or client information to better understand our users’ and clients’ needs, to develop and improve our services, our marketing and other operational activities.

Should you exercise your right to withdraw your consent (by writing to us at the physical or email address below), we will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing your data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which we are subject) where we would be legally authorised or required to process your personal data without needing your consent and if so, notify you accordingly.<br/><br/>When we ask for such personal data, you may always decline, however should you decline to provide us with that necessary data we require to provide the services you require, we may not necessarily be able to provide you with such services (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to us).</p><h3 class="heading_h3-legal">Your Right to Object to Certain Processing</h3><p class="copy_legal">We only process your personal data when this is <br/>1.) necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or <br/>2.) when processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. You have the right to object to processing of your personal data by us. <br/><br/>Where an objection is entered, the processing of data shall cease, unless we as data controller provide compelling and legitimate grounds requiring the continuation of the data processing which outweigh the objections you may have raised. When your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. <br/><br/>Please note, that this general right to object does not subsist when we process your personal data because it is necessary for the performance of a contract, when necessary for legal compliance or when processing of the data is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another natural person.</p><h3 class="heading_h3-legal">Your Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3><p class="copy_legal">You also have the right to lodge complaints with the appropriate Data Protection Supervisory Authority.
