                        (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (optout.aboutads.info). Users of our App may opt-out of receiving targeted

                <u>For California Residents</u>
                <p>
                    This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share personal information of California residents when we act as a
                    “business” as defined under California privacy laws, and their rights with respect to their personal information. For purposes of this section, “personal
                    information” has the meaning given under California privacy laws but does not include information exempted from the scope of such laws. In some cases we may
                    provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Personal Information That We Collect, Purposes of Collection and Use, and Disclosures, “Sales,” and “Sharing” of Personal Information</b><br />
                    We describe the categories of personal information we collect and may have collected about you in the preceding 12 months, and the categories of sources from
                    which we collect such personal information, in the section above called “Personal Information We Collect.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The specific business and commercial purposes for which we collect and use this information are described in the section above called “Use of Personal
                    Information.” To the extent that we collect personal information that qualifies as “sensitive” under California privacy laws, we only use or disclose it
                    for purposes permitted under those laws (e.g., to perform the Services, detect security incidents and prevent fraud, and to verify and maintain the quality
                    of the Services). We do not collect or use sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about California residents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Personal Information Disclosed for Business Purposes, “Sold,” or “Shared”</b><br />
                    Each category of personal information listed above may be disclosed, and has in the preceding 12 months been disclosed to the categories of third parties
                    set out in the section above called “Sharing of Personal Information” for the business purposes described in the Privacy Policy, such as to provide the
                    Services or for research and development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, when we provide personal information to certain third parties or permit them to automatically collect personal information on the Services
                    (such as our advertising partners like Google), California privacy laws may define this type of disclosure as a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.
                    Specifically, when we “sell” personal information, that means we are disclosing a California resident’s personal information to a third party for monetary
                    or other valuable consideration. When we disclose personal information to third parties for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not
                    for monetary or other valuable consideration, it qualifies as “sharing” under California law. <br />
                    We may “sell” or “share,” and in the preceding twelve months may have “sold” or “shared,” (1) Individual Identifiers, and (2) Internet or Network Activity,
                    in each case for purposes of advertising our Services, identifying new customers or potential customers, and the other purposes described above under the section
                    titled “Use of Personal Information.” We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of California residents under 16 years of age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Retention of Personal Information</b><br />
                    We will retain each of the categories of personal information listed above for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose of collection, including for the purposes
                    of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish and defend legal claims, for fraud prevention purposes, or as long as required to meet
                    our legal obligations. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
                    information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information
                    and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

                    When exercising your rights or otherwise assisting you, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. This is a
                    security measure to ensure we do not, for example, disclose personal information to any person who is not entitled to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
                    you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. The identity verification process may vary based on the type of request and
                    how it is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If you do so, we may require your proof of identification, the authorized agent’s proof
                    of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify your request, including evidence of valid permission for the authorized agent
                    to act on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, we will not be able to process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to
                    comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

                    <b>California Notice of Financial Incentive</b><br />
                    We may offer certain financial incentive programs that can result in different price, rate,  level, or quality of goods or services, provided that such programs are 
                    reasonably related to the value of your personal information to us. For example, we may offer additional content to users who sign up for our mailing list, or giveaways, 
                    sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotional campaigns. We typically ask you to provide your email address or other contact information in order to participate 
                    in these programs or campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer these programs and campaigns because, among other things, the value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted 
                    services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable program or campaign. This value is based on the expense related to 
                    offering those services and benefits to participants, along with other factors such as whether and to what extent you take advantage of (or opt-out from) any offerings 
                    and whether we are able to use the data we collect from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we offer any program or campaign, there is no obligation to opt-in, and you may withdraw at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the 
                    applicable program rules or in the “Contacting Us” section below. Please review the applicable program or campaign offering or terms to view full details, including how 
                    to join.
