<div class="f4">Last Updated: January 1, 2023</div>
<p class="lh-copy">Welcome to Chartable. By accessing the Chartable website ("Site") or using the services offered by Chartable ("Services") you agree and acknowledge to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms or to our Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site or use the Services. Chartable reserves the right to change these Terms at any time. We recommend that you periodically check this Site for changes.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Changes to the Terms of Service</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We reserve the right to update and revise these Terms at any time. We’ll make sure to also change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page so you can tell if these Terms have changed since your last visit. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Please review these Terms regularly because once we post any changes, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Usage of the Site and Services</p>
<p class="lh-copy">Chartable grants you limited, revocable and non-transferable permission to access the Site and use the Services in accordance with these Terms and the instructions and guidelines posted on the Site. Chartable reserves the right to terminate this agreement including your right to use the Site and Services at any time and for any reason or in the future charge for commercial usage.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Eligibility; User Restrictions</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We only permit individuals who are at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your province, territory or country, and who can form legally binding contracts with us to use the Services. Individuals under the age of 18, or the applicable age of majority, (“Minors”) may utilize the Services only with the consent and support of a parent, legal guardian or other qualified adult. If you are a parent or guardian and you allow your Minor to use the Services, you agree to be bound by the Minor’s use of the Services and by these Terms. If you are a Minor and do not have the requisite parent or guardian consent, please do not attempt to access or use the Services.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">You can only use or receive the Services to the extent the laws of your jurisdiction or the United States do not bar you from doing so. Please make sure these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to you. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Access to Services; Account Registration</p>
<p class="lh-copy">By accessing the Services, you warrant that:</p>
<p class="lh-copy">(i) You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts;</p>
<p class="lh-copy">(ii) All registration information you submit is truthful and accurate;</p>
<p class="lh-copy">(iii) You will maintain the accuracy of such information; and</p>
<p class="lh-copy">(iv) Your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">To access our Services, you may be required to register with the Site and create a user account (“Account”). If you create an Account, you are solely responsible for any activity that occurs through your Account. In order for us to provide you the best possible service, you agree to provide us with complete, accurate, and updated information for your Account at all times. You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your Account is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the content on the Service and grant a license to Chartable. If any information is incorrect or outdated, it can lead to errors or delays, for which we will not be responsible.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">You should not share your Account information. You should not use another person’s Account or registration information for the Services without permission. Similarly, no one else should be able to use your Account without permission. You are solely responsible for keeping your Account and Account password secure and for any consequence resulting from your failure to do so. You should never publish, distribute, or post login information for your Account.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms. You can always delete your Account by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="97fff2fbe7d7f4fff6e5e3f6f5fbf2b9f4f8fa">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Payment Terms</p>
<p class="lh-copy">All invoices are payable by you to Chartable net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. All amounts owed by you to Chartable for the Services (“Service Fees”) are in U.S. Dollars. Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is higher. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all Service Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. To the extent Chartable requires payment via credit card for any Services, you hereby authorize Chartable to charge such credit card on the above basis for amounts due. You agree to maintain its credit card in an active status, and/or provide updated credit card and billing information to Chartable to allow for the payments. You agree to pay for all charges for Services if charges made to your credit card are unsuccessful for any reason. Chartable currently uses a third party payment processor to process credit card payments. The processing of credit card payment will be subject to the third party processor’s privacy policy.</p>
<p class="f4 lh-copy">Taxes</p>
<p class="lh-copy">Unless stated otherwise, the amounts that the parties must pay under this agreement are exclusive of VAT, GST, HST, sales taxes or other similar taxes, duties, charges or assessments ("Indirect Taxes"). Chartable reserves the right to collect any Indirect Taxes that may become due in accordance with applicable law in connection with the Services. Where required by the law of a jurisdiction, each party will provide the other with a valid VAT registration number and if requested, a declaration as to VAT registration status. Each party will fulfill its obligations relating to Indirect Taxes including any obligation to pay Indirect Tax where applicable. The parties will use their best efforts to ensure the correct Indirect Tax outcomes. You will provide all information requested by Chartable from time to time to ensure the proper tax reporting and treatment of payments contemplated herein. Each party shall be solely responsible for the payment and reporting of all taxes applicable to its own income and activities in each jurisdiction where applicable. Chartable assumes no liability or responsibility for any of your tax obligations and related compliance and filings arising as a result of this agreement or otherwise. Digital service taxes (“DST”) will be added on top of agreed amounts for all jurisdictions where DSTs are enacted. The parties agree that, to the best of their knowledge, there is no withholding tax applicable to payments due to Chartable under this agreement; however, if tax must be withheld, you are required to gross up the payment to Chartable, so that the amount received by Chartable is the same amount as Chartable would have received if no tax was withheld.</p>
