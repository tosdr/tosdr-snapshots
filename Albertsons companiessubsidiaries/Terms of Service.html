<p>The Online Ordering Services Terms - Additional Terms Applicable to Users Who Place Online Orders</p>
<hr>
<!-- <p class="bold">Part Two Additional Terms Applicable to Users Who Place Online Orders</p> -->
<div id="section-2-1">
    <h2>1. The Online Ordering Services Terms <strong>Apply to Online Orders.</strong></h2>
    <p>These Online Ordering Services Terms, in addition to the Terms, apply to users who order Offerings from Company
        or products from Seller (as defined below) through the Online Grocery Ordering Service for delivery or pickup,
        where we offer such Offerings. Certain third-party sellers ("Sellers") operate storefronts and sell products
        through a third-party seller hub on the Online Grocery Ordering Service (the "Safeway Marketplace"). If you
        purchase any Seller(s) products via the Safeway Marketplace, you are purchasing directly from those Sellers, not
        from Company. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings and/or
        products of any of these Sellers (including the content of their sites). To the fullest extent provided by
        applicable law, Company has no responsibility or liability for any Seller, their products, or representations.
        Company does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and/or content of or for any
        of these Sellers.</p>
    <p>The Online Grocery Ordering Service may be accessed through our Sites; please note, however, that certain
        features available on a Company website for the Online Grocery Ordering Service may not be accessible via the
        mobile App and vice-versa. In addition, portions of these Online Ordering Services Terms apply to users who
        order Special Order Items, such as deli platters, custom cakes and bakery items, or holiday meals, from certain
        stores that have implemented a separate Catering Order Service specifically for Special Order Items. These
        Online Ordering Services Terms do not apply to purchases you make as a shopper at any of our physical stores or
        to our in-store promotions, programs, and offers (e.g., Monopoly Game), which may not be available to our Online
        Grocery Ordering Service customers.</p>
    <p>If you place an order for Offerings via any third-party website or mobile application, whether or not we direct
        you to the third-party site or application, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third
        party service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third
        party service provider. If you access the third party's site or application to place your order, your order will
        be subject to the terms, policies, actions, or inactions of such third party.</p>
    <p>References on our Sites to any names, marks, Offerings, or services of third parties, or links to third-party
        sites or information, are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or its
        information, Offerings, or services. Company is not responsible for the content of any third-party linked site
        or any link contained in a linked site, including any third-party social media or mobile app platform with which
        our Sites operate or otherwise interact, nor is Company responsible for the acts or omissions of any operator of
        any such site or platform. Your use of any such third-party site or platform is at your own risk and will be
        governed by such third party's terms and policies (including its privacy policy).</p>

<div id="section-2-2">
    <h2>2. You Must Be 18 Years Old or Older to Order.</h2>
    <p>You must be age 18 or older and a resident of the United States in order to use either the Online Grocery
        Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service; provided, however, that you must be 21 or older to accept
        delivery/pickup of any alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings.</p>

    </p>
</div>
<div id="section-2-3">
    <h2>3. You Must Create an Account for the Online Grocery Ordering Service.</h2>
    <p>To use the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you must create an Account, as provided in the Terms. Please note, if
        your Online Grocery Order includes a Seller or other third-party service provider (such as last-mile delivery
        provider), the personal information necessary will be disclosed to that party for the purpose of fulfilling your
        order. Company may use third party service providers to perform Offerings at its discretion, with no notice to
        you.</p>
    <p>During the registration process, you may be asked to provide information (or confirm information that auto-fills)
        about your participation in Company Loyalty Programs, such as a whether you have a club card or telephone number
        you already use in-store to receive Offering price discounts or accrue rewards program benefits. If this
        information is provided during the registration process, any loyalty benefits that you may earn on orders placed
        online, such as rewards points that can be redeemed for gas or groceries, or discount offers based on your
        shopping behavior, typically will be available when using that Company Loyalty Programs card or telephone number
        in-store and vice-versa. If you are participating in an existing Company Loyalty Program at the time you
        register for an Account in the Online Grocery Ordering Service, but such information is not filled in, the
        Online Grocery Ordering Service will assign the Account a virtual Company Loyalty Programs number. This virtual
        Company Loyalty Programs number will enable you to receive Offering price discounts available to participants in
        Company Loyalty Programs if and when those discounts are provided through the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
        However, other benefits that may be earned for orders placed online, such as rewards points ordinarily
        redeemable for grocery or gas rewards, will not be available when using your existing Company Loyalty Programs
        number in-store.</p>
    <p>In addition, in some areas, different Company banners will partner with each other to deliver online orders. In
        those cases, the pricing, rewards programs and discounts applicable to your order placed through the Online
        Grocery Ordering Service will be that of the Company banner fulfilling the order. You may apply for the
        partnering banner's Company Loyalty Programs for use with your Online Grocery Ordering Service Account. For
        questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service,
        contact Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.</p>

    <h2>4. Additional Disclaimers.</h2>
    <p><strong>Important: In addition to the disclaimers set forth in the Terms and solely except as set forth in our
            Satisfaction Guarantee in Section 10 of these Online Ordering Services Terms, the Online Grocery Ordering
            Service and Catering Order Service are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties
            of any kind, and to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Company disclaims any and all
            warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement, with respect to the Online Grocery Ordering Service
            and Catering Order Service, any Offerings or Special Order Items purchased through the Online Grocery
            Ordering Service or Catering Order Service, and any delivery or pickup service. Company does not warrant
            that the Online Grocery Ordering Service or Catering Order Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, that
            defects will be corrected, or that the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service will be
            free of viruses or other harmful components. Company does not make any representations or warranties
            regarding the access to or use of, or the results of the access to or use of, the Content on the Online
            Grocery Ordering Service or Catering Order Service in terms of their correctness, accuracy, validity,
            completeness, usefulness, timeliness, suitability, reliability, or otherwise.</strong>&nbsp;Applicable law
        may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you.</p>

    </p>
</div>
<div id="section-2-5">
    <h2>5. Placing an Order in the Online Grocery Ordering Service.</h2>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>You Must Make a Minimum Purchase.</strong>&nbsp;The minimum purchase amount shown in the Online
        Grocery Ordering Service must be met to place an order. The minimum purchase amount is shown as the "Subtotal of
        All Items" (which we refer to as the "Subtotal" of the order in these Online Ordering Services Terms), and is
        the sum total of the order calculated from the quantities and online prices for the Offerings selected, but
        excluding all other charges, fees and discounts, such as any applicable taxes, service or delivery fees, bag
        fees, bottle/container deposits, promotional discounts not reflected in the online prices for the Offerings, and
        in certain jurisdictions alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy Offerings. In addition, certain offers may
        specify a potentially different minimum purchase amount to receive a discount. In those cases, the Subtotal of
        All Items, minus certain Offerings such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy must equal the stated
        minimum, in order for you to receive the discount or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you. We may
        change the minimum purchase amount at any time, without notice to you.</p>
    <p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>We May Limit Quantities.&nbsp;</strong>We reserve the right to limit the quantity of any
        particular Offering ordered in our discretion, including without limitation, due to inventory control or other
        reasons. Offering availability is subject to the inventory on hand and may vary geographically or change without
        notice. Please note that we reserve the right to source the Offerings from any of our stores in any location (or
        the stores of any of our affiliated companies or Sellers in any location).</p>
    <p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>You Agree to Pay for Your Order.</strong>&nbsp;By submitting an order via the Online Grocery
        Ordering Service, you offer to purchase the Offering(s)specified in your order. We will send you an electronic
        confirmation that your order has been received and the offer accepted, subject to our final confirmation of
        Offering availability and price; however, we also reserve the right to cancel your order, in whole or in part,
        at any time in our sole discretion, and to refuse to provide delivery/pickup service for any order, in whole or
        in part. Subject to the foregoing, if your order is accepted by Company, and not cancelled prior to delivery,
        Company will provide the Offering(s) ordered in return for your payment and deliver the ordered items to the
        delivery address or pickup location you designate in your order, subject to the provisions of the Terms and
        these Online Ordering Services Terms.</p>
    <p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>We Accept Major Credit and Debit Cards and Certain Other Payment Methods.</strong>&nbsp;You must
        select one of the payment methods identified in the Online Grocery Ordering Service and provide accurate and
        complete information for us to charge your payment method for orders you place. By providing payment card
        information, you consent to and authorize storage of your card data (name, credit/debit card number, expiration
        date) for purposes of future online transactions, all transactions made via the Sites and the Company charging
        your selected payment method in the amount of each such transaction. Order processing will not occur until
        authorized. When processing credit or debit card payments, we will run a temporary pre-authorization hold. Your
        bank may take up to 5 business days after delivery/pickup to release the hold and display your final charge.</p>
    <p>In addition to major credit and debit cards, we accept Electronic Benefit Transfer (“EBT”) as a method of
        payment, which is a PIN-based transaction. Upon entry of the correct PIN, we assume the person entering the PIN
        is authorized to make SNAP and/or EBT Cash purchases with the card used for SNAP or EBT Cash payment at our
        Sites. When you enter EBT card details, we will store a tokenized version of your card number for future
        transactions. You may choose to not have your EBT card number stored by unchecking the box.</p>
    <p>Only one EBT card may be associated with your account number pursuant to United States Department of Agriculture
        ("USDA"), Food and Nutrition Service ("FNS"), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") regulations.
    </p>
    <p>SNAP benefits may not be used to pay for any items or charges that are non-SNAP eligible. Non-SNAP eligible
        charges include, but are not limited to, tips, delivery fees, service fees, ordering fees or convenience fees
        that may apply to online orders while using the Site. For complete details on what are eligible items using SNAP
        funds, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items">https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items</a>.
    </p>
    <p>EBT Cash may be used the same as cash to pay for SNAP eligible items, non-SNAP eligible items, fees, other
        charges, and taxes, as permitted by the laws of your state. Several states have laws placing restrictions or
        prohibitions on the use of EBT Cash. Please consult your state's EBT guidelines on what may be purchased using
        EBT Cash.</p>
    <p>Customers who use EBT as a form of payment may choose to allocate how much in funds to apply across SNAP, EBT
        Cash and other payment types. Customers who have a valid EBT card number saved as a payment type with us are not
        subject to meet minimum dollar amounts in order to checkout. The maximum amount applied to SNAP is limited to
        the SNAP-eligible total amount of the order, or the account holder’s balance, whichever is the lower. If your
        order is canceled after your EBT card has been debited, we will promptly issue a refund back to the EBT account
        type you used, and you will receive an email notification within twenty-four (24) hours of the cancellation
        event.</p>
    <p>Because random weight items (such as meat and produce) may vary in weight and price, in accordance with the SNAP
        Online Purchasing Pilot guidelines, we apply a 10% surcharge at checkout on such items. At the day and time your
        order is fulfilled and processed, if the actual price of the random weight item is less than what you paid at
        checkout when you placed the order with the surcharge, we will refund the difference to you.</p>
    <p>You represent and warrant to Company that your use of your selected payment method(s) for Online Grocery Ordering
        Service transactions is authorized and legal. It is your responsibility to promptly notify your bank, financial
        institution, or other responsible party of any changes to your billing information, or the loss, theft, or
        unauthorized use of your payment method. You are responsible for updating your payment information with Company
        whenever it is no longer current/accurate.</p>
    <p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Your Total at Checkout Is an Estimate.</strong>&nbsp;The dollar amount displayed prior to order
        completion is only an estimate, based on Offerings selected and prices at the time of ordering, and estimated
        product weights for certain Offerings in your order, as adjusted by some (but not all) potentially applicable
        additional charges and fees and potentially applicable discounts and other deductions (collectively, the
        "Estimated Total").&nbsp;<strong>The actual amount that you will be charged for the order will be based on the
            prices, charges, fees, offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to the
            order at the time of online checkout, regardless of the date of the scheduled
            delivery/checkout</strong>&nbsp;(collectively, the "Final Total"). The Final Total cannot be determined
        until the day and time the order is sourced and processed for multiple reasons, including without limitation:
        (i) the availability of the Offerings selected and the need to substitute different priced Offerings cannot be
        confirmed until the day and time that they are prepared for delivery/pickup, (ii) Offering weights and prices,
        as well as available promotions, may vary between the date you submit the order and the date and time that the
        order is prepared for delivery/pickup, and (iii) certain charges, such as any applicable taxes, bottle deposits,
        and bag charges, cannot be determined until the order is prepared for delivery/pickup. In addition, even though
        we make an effort to describe and display our Offerings accurately on the Sites, Offerings on the Site may be
        mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable and we may experience delay in updating information on the
        Sites and in our advertising on the Sites.&nbsp;<strong>The Final Total that you will be charged for your order
            upon sourcing and processing likely will not equal exactly the Estimated Total.</strong></p>
    <p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>When the Final Total Is Due.</strong>&nbsp;Your payment of the Final Total amount for each
        order, including all applicable fees, taxes, and charges, will be charged as part of the order sourcing and
        processing procedure, but in any event is due no later than when the order is delivered or picked up. Company
        will charge the Final Total amount for the order to the payment method you selected during the order submission
        process. You authorize Company to make and collect such payment and charge. You acknowledge that if we cannot
        collect the charge for any reason, we may elect to turn the matter over to a collection agency.</p>
    <p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Changing or Canceling Your Order.&nbsp;</strong>Typically, you may cancel or change your order
        made on the Online Grocery Ordering Service up until the date and time noted in the Online Grocery Ordering
        Service. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper
        functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. All times listed are in the
        local time zone for your specified delivery/pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when
        placing the order. Note that any changes you may make to orders may affect whether your order continues to
        qualify for the same prices, discounts, promotions, or Promo Code Deals as your original order. If your changed
        order will qualify for a Promo Code Deal that your original order did not and you are unable to enter the Promo
        Code during the Order Edit process, make a note of the Promo Code Deal(s) and call our Customer Service line
        toll-free at (877) 505-4040 after your order is delivered/picked up, if the discount has not been applied. You
        may also change the delivery/pickup day and time after submitting your order, subject to order cut off times and
        the availability of your desired delivery/pickup time at the time you request a change. This ability may be
        suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online
        Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. Please note that changing your delivery/pickup date, if
        allowed, may affect Product prices and availability, as well as the availability of certain offers, discounts,
        and promotions.</p>

    <h2>6. Offering Pricing, Fees and Other Charges.</h2>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Prices, Fees and Other Charges</strong>.</p>
    <p>(1)&nbsp;<strong>Online Prices. Prices for Offerings you order for delivery or pickup through the Online Grocery
            Ordering Service may be higher than the prices for such Offerings in our physical
            stores.&nbsp;</strong>Pricing may differ depending on the fulfillment method you select, e.g., delivery,
        pickup, rush delivery. In addition, in some locations, order fulfillment and delivery may be provided by another
        of the Company's banners or affiliates or an independent third party service provider that provides selection
        and/or delivery services to consumers. In those cases, the availability, fees, and pricing of the partnering
        banner may apply to your order. For Offerings sold by weight, a representative cost per unit may be used to
        calculate the Estimated Total. The actual cost will be determined when the order is prepared for pickup or
        delivery and that cost will be reflected in the Final Total, which may be higher or lower than the estimate.
        Offerings offered with a price discount for participants in Company Loyalty Programs online may differ from
        Offerings offered with such a price discount in our physical stores.</p>
    <p>(2)&nbsp;<strong>Delivery Fees.</strong>&nbsp;We charge a non-refundable delivery fee on all delivery orders
        through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, unless expressly stated with a particular order, which will be
        included in both the Estimated Total for your order and the Final Total charged for that order. A delivery fee
        helps operate our fleet of trucks that transports your order from our store to your delivery address (or in the
        case of Safeway Marketplace, helps our Sellers to deliver products directly to you). From time to time, we may
        waive or provide discounts off our regular delivery fees for certain delivery times, which you may obtain by
        selecting such delivery time. We may also make other discounts available in certain locations via a Promo Code,
        in which case, you must enter the required Promo Code when you place your order and your order must meet any
        conditions of the offer, such as a minimum purchase amount. Service fees still apply. Promo Code offers for
        discounted or free delivery/pickup orders are not valid in Lake Powell. In some locations, we may also offer a
        subscription to delivery services on a recurring monthly or annual fee-paid basis, which may reduce or eliminate
        delivery or delivery and service fees on individual orders. The delivery fee does not constitute a tip to the
        delivery person.</p>
    <p>(3)&nbsp;<strong>Service Fees.</strong>&nbsp;We may charge a non-refundable service fee on all delivery/pickup
        orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, which will be included in both the Estimated Total and the
        Final Total for the order. A service fee helps operate our in-store processes for picking and preparing online
        orders, as well as operate our online processes and platforms. The service fee does not constitute a tip to the
        delivery person.</p>
    <p>(4)&nbsp;<strong>Governmental Fees and Taxes.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the fees and charges stated above, all
        governmental fees and taxes, including without limitation, sales tax, sweetened beverage taxes, bottle and
        container deposits, bottled water charges, and bag fees, which apply to your order will be included in the Final
        Total amount.</p>
    <p>(5)&nbsp;<strong>Tax Exempt Orders.</strong>&nbsp;The Online Grocery Ordering Service cannot verify documentation
        that certain organizations may normally present during in-store transactions to avoid the collection of sales
        tax due to their nonprofit nature.</p>
    <p>(6)&nbsp;<strong>Fee Changes.</strong>&nbsp;Company reserves the right to add, delete or change any fees or other
        charges applicable to the Online Grocery Ordering Service at any time.</p>
    <p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Price Changes.</strong>&nbsp;Please note that Offering prices are subject to change without
        notice and may vary geographically.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-2-7">
    <h2>7. Availability of Promotional Offers and Coupons on the Online Grocery Ordering Service.</h2>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong>&nbsp;Discounts available through some, but not all, promotional
        offers will appear in your Estimated Total at checkout. However, all discounts for which your order is eligible
        will be reflected in the Final Total for such order. Note that to be eligible for ‘for U™ Program’ promotions,
        you must have provided/confirmed information about your participation in the for U™ Program at the time you
        registered for your Account or through Customer Service. In addition, some for U™ Program promotions are valid
        in a limited geographic area and the store fulfilling your order may not fall within the applicable zone, in
        which case, you will not receive affected for U™ Program offers. To be eligible for promotions that require
        entry of a Promo Code, you must have entered the applicable Promo Code. To be eligible for promotions that
        require a minimum purchase amount, you must have met the minimum purchase amount. Note that some items are
        excluded from the calculation of the minimum purchase, such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and fluid dairy.
        All promotional offers are valid through their stated expiration dates, may be limited to specific quantities,
        are valid while supplies last and are limited to quantities on hand. You agree to abide by the terms and

    <h2>8. Delivery/Pickup Options.</h2>
    <p>In locations where delivery or pickup service is offered, one or more fulfillment options may be available. The
        fulfillment options that are available to you will be displayed in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. We may
        add, modify, or discontinue any delivery, pickup, and/or other fulfillment services at any time, or increase or
        decrease features related thereto, with or without notice. In addition, in some cases, we may transfer your
        order to be fulfilled or delivered by a third party fulfillment partner. Please note, pickup and/or delivery
        options may be available through third-party platforms, websites, applications, or marketplaces, and in some
        cases, we may direct you to the third party’s website to place your order. If you place an order for Offerings
        via any third-party website, marketplace, platform, or application (collectively, "third party sites"), whether
        or not we direct you to the third-party site or application, or otherwise use any services provided by a third
        party, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third party service provider and we are not
        responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third party service provider. Company does not
        assume any responsibility for the (i) content of, (ii) technology implemented by, or (iii) privacy practices of
        third party sites and all use is at your own risk. You should review the privacy policy and terms of use for
        each third party site and confirm they are acceptable prior to registration on or use of the site. Links to
        third party sites do not imply endorsement of the sites by Company. In no event shall Company be liable,
        directly or indirectly, to anyone for any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by the use of the linked
        sites or the information or material accessed through such sites including, without limitation, any incidental,
        special, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, attorneys' fees and lost profits or savings.</p>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Delivery/Pickup Service Times.</strong>&nbsp;Available delivery or pickup dates and times, and
        associated fees, delivery/pickup offers and promotions, will be shown during the ordering and checkout process.
        Times are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
    <p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Ordering Deadlines.</strong>&nbsp;The date and time by which you must place your order for the
        type of service and delivery/pickup time you have selected will be shown in the Online Ordering Grocery Service.
        Note that cut-off times for different fulfillment methods, for example delivery, pick up, rush delivery, may
        differ. Cut-off times may vary by Offering and by store location. All times are listed in the local time zone
        for your specified delivery or pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when placing the
        order. Special Order Items, such as a deli platter or custom cake, which are ordered less than 24 hours prior to
        planned pick up or delivery are not guaranteed. You may contact our Customer Service line toll-free at (877)
        505-4040 to learn if your request can be accommodated.</p>
    <p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>Responsibility for Delivery Address.</strong>&nbsp;We will deliver your order to a single
        delivery location you designate that is within the applicable delivery zone serviced by Company. You are
        responsible for verifying that the delivery address is correct, current, and accessible to our delivery drivers.
        We have no liability for orders that cannot be delivered due to address error or inaccessibility. You are
        responsible for verifying that the delivery location is one that is permitted to receive deliveries of the type
        of Offerings you purchased through the Online Ordering Grocery Service.</p>
    <p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>Picking Up a Pickup Order.</strong>&nbsp;Your order confirmation will include instructions about
        where to go to pick up your order. Plan to pick your order up at your selected time on the day it is ready for
        pickup. Any pickup orders not claimed by 8 PM local time on the day they are ready for pickup will be canceled
        and the Offerings restocked. We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee for orders that are restocked. We
        reserve the right to request that valid (non-expired, government issued) photo identification, the credit card
        used to place the applicable order, or other personal information be provided and/or presented to the store
        attendant upon arrival to the designated pickup location for verification purposes. If you send a person other
        than the individual whose name is on the order to pick up a pickup order, the person must either be designated
        in your order or from your household, and you consent to them receiving a copy of your receipt, if a receipt is
        provided by a store attendant. All information provided is subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Receiving a Delivery or Pickup Order.</strong>&nbsp;Someone over the age of 18 must be present
        to accept delivery or pickup orders. If your order contains alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other
        age-restricted Offerings, someone over the age of 21 must be present to accept and/or sign for delivery or
        pickup. By placing an order through the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service, you
        represent and warrant to us that a person age 18 or older, or age 21 or older in the case of orders containing
        alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings, will be present to receive the order,
        whether it be delivered or picked up. Valid (non-expired, government issued) identification confirming the
        identity and age of the person accepting and signing for the delivery or pickup order will be required,
        regardless of age, where age-restricted Offerings are in the order. The Offerings will be retained by the
        delivery driver or by the store attendant for pickup orders, unless someone over the required minimum age is at
        the delivery address when the delivery or pickup is attempted. You may contact our Customer Service line
        toll-free at (877) 505-4040 to arrange for re-delivery or to reschedule pickup of any Offerings retained in
        accordance with the foregoing. Please note that we may charge you an additional fee, or we may elect not to
        fulfill your request and cancel the order for the Offerings retained. We reserve the right to charge a
        restocking fee for orders that are restocked. We are now practicing contact-free social distancing for delivery
        and pickup, except in the case. If there are no age-restricted items in your, the delivery driver will leave
        them at your doorstep. Albertsons Companies is not responsible for the times in your order once bags are left on

    <p>From time to time, certain Company banners and store locations may offer in-home delivery of items ordered
        through the Online Grocery Ordering Service of the Catering Ordering Service. If you place an order for in-home
        delivery of Offerings, you are: (i) authorizing Company, its employees, or its independent contractors,
        (“Delivery Personnel”) to access and enter your home in the manner you designated at time of order or via
        communication with Company or Delivery Personnel for the purpose of delivering your order, and (ii) confirming
        that you have the right to authorize Delivery Personnel to access and enter your home as you have designated.
        Company reserves the right to decline to deliver your products in its sole discretion. You represent and warrant
        that your home will be safe and free of any hazards. You represent and warrant that you will make any and all
        other occupants within the home aware that an in-home delivery will be performed, and that Delivery Personnel
        are authorized to enter the home. You are responsible for compliance with the Terms and these Online Ordering
        Services Terms by other occupants within the home. You agree that you will contain any and all pets during any
        such in-home delivery.</p>
    <p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>Unattended Delivery.</strong>&nbsp;Where available, this option may not be used for any orders
        containing alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings. If you select this option, the
        delivery driver will leave the Offerings in your order at your doorstep, in which case unrestricted access to
        your doorstep is required.</p>
    <p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Responsibility for Items After Delivery/Pickup.</strong>&nbsp;Company is not responsible for the

        refrigerate or freeze perishable Offerings as soon as possible after pickup/delivery but no more than one hour
        after pickup/delivery.</p>
    <p>(h)&nbsp;<strong>Inclement Weather or Unforeseen Complications.</strong>&nbsp;In the case of inclement weather or
        unforeseen delivery or pickup complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery or pickup
        schedule which cause us to suspend chosen delivery or pickup dates and times. If there will be a significant
        delay in delivering or preparing your order for pickup, we may (but are not obligated to) call, email or text
        you to let you know the status of your order. If your designated delivery location is inaccessible on the date
        and time specified for delivery (such as due to a street closure or other complications), we will provide you
        with a full refund of your order. We will have no liability for any delay in delivery or pickup orders.</p>
    <p>(i)&nbsp;<strong>No Other Offerings.</strong>&nbsp;Neither our delivery driver nor the store attendant assisting
        you with your pickup order are able to supply, retrieve or purchase on your behalf any Offerings that you did
        not order when placing your order. That said, you are welcome to enter into a store location to purchase
        additional products or place an additional order for a later pickup or delivery.</p>

<p>FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. </p>
<ol><li><b>Claims Subject to this Section</b>. These Dispute Resolution Terms apply to all Claims between you and the Company. A “Claim” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed in Section 4) between you and <span>the Company</span>, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, as permitted by law, that arises from or relates to your Account; access to or use of the Company’s Services; purchases from the Company; the use of your information by or for the Company; any aspect of your relationship or interactions with the Company as a consumer or potential consumer; the arbitrability, validity, enforceability, or scope of these Terms or any portion of them.</li><br><li><b>Customer Service Resolution.</b>Our Customer Support Center is available to address any concerns you may have regarding your Account, access to or use of the Company’s Services, purchases from the Company, the use of your information by or for the Company, or any aspect of your relationship or interactions with the Company. You may contact them by phone at 877-723-3929; on-line at <a href="https://www.albertsons.com/inquiry/contact-us.html" style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;">https://www.albertsons.com/inquiry/contact-us.html</a></li><br><li><b>Required Informal Dispute Resolution.</b> Except as permitted under Section 4, if you have a Claim against the Company or if the Company has a Claim against you, you and the Company must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally before either party may bring the Claim in arbitration. You and the Company will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for 45 days the resolution of any Claim or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by you and the Company (“Informal Resolution Period”) from the day you or the Company receive a written notice of a Claim from the other party (a “Claimant Notice”) in accordance with this Section 3.<p>You will send any Claimant Notice to the Company by certified mail addressed to Customer Support Center, Albertsons Companies, Inc., M/S 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038-9093.&nbsp;The Company will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to the Company, including the email address associated with your Account or the Company. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i)&nbsp;include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant Account or purchase information; (ii)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii)&nbsp;set forth the specific relief requested.</p><p>The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of resolution if it chooses to do so. You or the Company cannot file a Claim in arbitration (or court in accordance with Section 4) before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or the Company file a Claim in arbitration or court without complying with all the requirements in these Dispute Resolution Terms, including waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court to enjoin the filing and seek damages from the party who has not followed the requirements in this Section 3, including to reimburse that party for any costs and fees—including arbitration fees, attorney fees, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.</p><p>The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim will be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that Claim so that you and the Company can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.</p></li><li><b>Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions.</b>Except for Claims (i) exclusively related to the intellectual-property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights) of you or the Company, including any disputes in which you or the Company seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or the Company’s intellectual property or other infringement of your or the Company’s intellectual-property rights (“IP Claims”) or (ii) that are properly asserted in small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property or intellectual-property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 3 will only be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Such Claims include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the arbitrability, validity, enforceability, or scope of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.</li><br><li><b>Binding Individual Arbitration.</b>&nbsp;Subject to the terms of this Section 5, a Claim not excluded under Section 4 may only be resolved by binding individual arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), https://adr.org/, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”). For Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” meaning that you only use an Account and/or the Services for personal, family, or household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are the rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Terms (the “Rules”). For Claims that must be arbitrated by the AAA, if you are not a Consumer, the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Dispute Resolution Terms.<p>If the AAA notifies the parties in writing (email suffices) that it is not available to arbitrate any Claim, that Claim may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator of National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), www.namadr.com/, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”). For Claims arbitrated by NAM, the then-current version of NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Dispute Resolution Terms.</p><p>This agreement to arbitrate affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of these Terms will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Dispute Resolution Terms, and the applicable Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim in arbitration and to grant any remedy or relief that would be available in a court under law or in equity, including the power to determine all questions of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or the Company to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. </p><p>You or the Company may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA in accordance with the Rules (or with NAM in accordance with the Rules if applicable pursuant to this Section 5). Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, and instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling NAM at 800-358-2550. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to the Company by certified mail addressed to Customer Support Center, Albertsons Companies, Inc., M/S 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038-9093. The Company will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to the Company, including the email address associated with your Account. You and the Company both agree that the arbitrator must follow the terms of this agreement to arbitrate.</p><p>Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration agreement set forth in these Dispute Resolution Terms shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims. Any such claims so released from arbitration must be resolved in accordance with Section 13.</p></li><li><b>Arbitration Fees.&nbsp;</b>Except for the circumstances outlined in Sections 7 and 8 and for Mass Arbitrations (as defined in Section 10), to the extent the initial-filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial-filing fee for a lawsuit, the Company will pay the difference in fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you and the Company have 90 days from receipt of an arbitration-fee invoice to pay the invoiced arbitration fees.</li><br><li><b>Frivolous or Improper Claims.&nbsp;</b>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs incurred by the responding party, including any attorney fees, related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument or (ii) the Claim was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or increase the cost of dispute resolution.</li><br><li><b>Offers of Settlement.&nbsp;</b>Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer for a Claim. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable to a party than the last written offer of settlement that party did not accept, that party must pay all costs and fees—including arbitration fees—incurred by the other party after the written settlement offer was made.</li><br><li><b>Confidentiality.&nbsp;</b>If you or the Company submits a Claim to arbitration, you and the Company agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade-secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of any discovery in the arbitration. You and the Company agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.</li><br><li><b>Mass Arbitration.&nbsp;</b>If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel as other Claimants, these will be considered “Mass Arbitrations” and will be treated as mass arbitrations according to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (or if filed with NAM, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), if and to the extent Mass Arbitrations are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Dispute Resolution Terms. You or the Company may advise the other if you or the Company believe that Claims are Mass Arbitrations, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Mass Arbitrations” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. To the extent either party is asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, that party waives any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. The following procedures are intended to supplement the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (or if filed with NAM, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them.<p><b>Mass Arbitrations may only be filed in arbitration as permitted by the process set forth in the applicable Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and as supplemented below. Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for Claims asserted in a Mass Arbitration from the time a compliant Claimant Notice has been received by the Company until these Dispute Resolution Terms permit such Mass Arbitration to proceed in arbitration or court.</b></p><p><u>Initial Bellwether:</u> The bellwether process set forth in this section will not proceed until counsel representing the Mass Arbitrations has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Mass Arbitrations in their existing inventory have been submitted to the arbitration provider.</p><p>After that point, counsel for the parties will select 20 Mass Arbitration claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its arguments. Each side will select 10 claimants who have submitted compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may proceed to be arbitrated by the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Mass Arbitration claims will be delayed by this bellwether process. Any remaining Mass Arbitration claims that are not selected for the bellwether shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and until they are selected to proceed in individual arbitration proceedings as set out in this Section 10.</p><p>A single arbitrator will preside over each individual arbitration in the Mass Arbitration chosen for a bellwether proceeding, however up to three individual arbitrations in the bellwether group of 20 may be arbitrated by the same arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.</p><p><u>Mediation:</u> Early mediation and dispute resolution of the Mass Arbitrations is encouraged.  Consequently, in addition to an early mediation that shall take place within 90 days the filing of the Mass Arbitrations, once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the Company agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining claims in the Mass Arbitrations with the mediator’s fee paid for by the Company. Counsel for the claimants and the Company must agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the Company cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate to ensure that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as possible after the mediator is appointed.</p><p><u>Remaining Claims:</u> If after the initial set of bellwether claims are arbitrated and the subsequent mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining claims that are part of the Mass Arbitrations, the arbitration requirement in these Dispute Resolution Terms will no longer apply to Mass Arbitrations for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Mass Arbitrations released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with Section 13.</p><p>Courts will have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this section and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.</p></li><li><b>30-Day Right to Opt Out.&nbsp;</b>You have the right to opt out this arbitration provision within 30 days of your first purchase from the Company after the date of these Terms of Use. You can opt out by going online at <a href="https://www.safeway.com/inquiry/contact-us.html">https://www.safeway.com/inquiry/contact-us.html</a> and selecting “Other” in the Topic drop down and typing “Arbitration Opt-Out” in the comments, or by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: M.S. 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038. Such notice must include the name of each person opting out and contact information for each such person and any relevant Membership or purchase information. If you send timely written notice containing the required information, then the arbitration requirement in these Dispute Resolution Terms will not apply to you or the Company. If you do not send such notice, you agree to arbitrate in accordance with these Dispute Resolution Terms.</li><br><li><b>Enforcement.&nbsp;</b>If any part of these Dispute Resolution Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will no longer apply to the parties, but all other parts of these Dispute Resolution Terms will remain in effect unless otherwise provided herein. If the Company does not enforce any provision of these Dispute Resolution Terms, that will not be considered a waiver of the Company’s rights. Any waiver of these Dispute Resolution Terms must be obtained in a written document signed by an authorized representative of the Company.<p>Except as otherwise provided in these Dispute Resolution Terms, if a Claim does not proceed in arbitration, the class-action waiver shall remain in effect, and a court may not preside over any action joining, coordinating, or consolidating the claims of multiple individuals in a single proceeding, except that you and the Company may participate in a classwide, collective, and/or representative settlement of Claims.</p></li><li><b>Governing Law; Venue.&nbsp;</b>These Dispute Resolution Terms, all Claims, and any matter related to or arising from your Account, access to and use of the Services, and the relationship and interactions between you and the Company shall be subject to and governed by, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. except for its conflict of law rules.<p>All Claims not subject to arbitration pursuant to these Dispute Resolution Terms and that cannot be heard in small-claims court will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Boise, Idaho.</p></li></ol>
