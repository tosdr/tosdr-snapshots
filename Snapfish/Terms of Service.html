<div><p>Last Updated: October 21, 2019</p></div>
<div><p>Welcome to Snapfish! Snapfish provides you with a fun, safe, and easy way to process, print, digitize, store, share and otherwise use (collectively "Process") photographs and other content offered to you on our website. Before you use or access our services, you must carefully review the Terms and Conditions set out below (the "Terms"). Specific pages on our website or mobile application (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) may set out additional terms and conditions, all of which are incorporated by reference into these Terms. We may be change or update these Terms at any time in accordance with Section XVII, but you can always find the most recent version <a href="https://www.snapfish.com/tac-overlay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. You should periodically check this page to make sure you have read the current version of these Terms.</p>
<p>Your use of the Services indicates your acceptance of these Terms and agreement to be bound by them. Acceptance of these Terms creates a binding contract between you and Snapfish whereby you agree to use the Services only in accordance with these Terms. If you have questions about these Terms, please contact <a href="https://support.snapfish.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Support</a>. Your use of the Services is entirely conditioned on and subject to your compliance with these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not access or use the Services.</p>
<p>Please read and carefully review these Terms, as they form a legally binding agreement between you and Snapfish. You should pay special attention to the arbitration provision set forth below which, except and to the extent prohibited by law, requires you to arbitrate any claims you may have against Snapfish on an individual basis. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p></div>
<h6 class="text-center">I. Your Account</h6>
<div class="row-gutter-2"></div>
<div><p>The Services are intended for adults. This means you must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. You can create a Snapfish account if you are at least 18 years old and submit certain requested information to Snapfish, including your name and correct email address. As a customer, you must provide Snapfish with true, accurate, and complete information about yourself when requested (whether by questionnaires, surveys, registration forms, or other informational requests), and must keep that information updated so it is current and accurate. You are responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your account and password, for restricting access to your account, and for all activities that occur under your account or password. You will immediately notify Snapfish of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>Your Snapfish account credentials will work across all Snapfish websites. However, while the majority of your data is accessible in your account across all websites, certain information, such as your projects and order history, may not be accessible because our service providers and product offerings vary between regions, and a project you start in one region may not be available for purchase in another. When you switch between regions for the first time, you will be given an opportunity to provide certain consents, as appropriate, for that region.</p>
<p><strong>For French residents only,</strong> if you provide your phone number, you have the right to object to being contacted by phone for direct marketing purposes at any time, by registering free of charge on <a href="http://www.bloctel.gouv.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.bloctel.gouv.fr</a>.</p>

<h6 class="text-center">II. Digital Image Storage</h6>
<div class="row-gutter-2"></div>
<div><p><strong>&ldquo;Active Participation&rdquo; Required</strong></p>
<p>Snapfish offers free, unlimited storage of online photos to customers who maintain Active Participation. &ldquo;Active Participation&rdquo; is defined as purchasing or ordering product through the Services at least once every 365 days. Purchases through Snapfish third-party advertisers do not count towards Active Participation. If you cease Active Participation for any reason, Snapfish reserves the right to terminate your account (or any part thereof) and your use of the Services, subject to the Termination provision in Section XIV of these Terms, and may remove and discard all information, communications, postings, albums, image files, creative material, photographs, videos, links, comments, and other content (collectively "Content") uploaded by you or otherwise made available by you via the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Termination of Services in Certain Locations</strong></p>
<p>If Snapfish decides to discontinue the Services in your country, your account will be automatically terminated when the Services discontinue. Snapfish will notify you at least thirty (30) days before any termination of Services in your country. Any unused free product credits will expire on the date Services end in your country.</p>
<p>Video storage may be provided depending on the Services you subscribe to. When you upload Content to the Services, the original resolution and format of your Content may be modified depending on the upload speed you choose. If you upload Content with very high resolution or bitrate Snapfish may, in its discretion, down-sample the Content regardless of the upload speed you choose.</p>
<p>You should always preserve your original Content, or make back-up copies of your Content, on your personal computer system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not use the Services as the only repository or single source for your Content</span>. The Services are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available,&rdquo; and Snapfish will not be liable for the loss of any Content.</p>
