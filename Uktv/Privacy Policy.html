We encourage you to contact us using the contact details provided below to let us know if any of your personal information is not accurate or changes, so that we can keep your personal information up-to-date. You can also review and correct/update some of your personal information by logging-in to your account and going to your Profile, if you have registered on one of the UKTV Digital Services.</li><li><strong>Objecting:</strong> In certain circumstances you also have the right to object to processing of your personal information: (i) which is based on our legitimate interests; (ii) for direct marketing purposes; and (iii) for profiling to the extent that it is related to direct marketing. If you would like to object to (i), please contact us using the contact details provided below. Please see the How We Use Your Personal Information section above for information on how to object to (ii) and (iii).</li><li><strong>Erasing and Restricting:</strong> You have the right to ask us to erase or restrict your personal information. If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below. Please note that there are exceptions to these rights, if, for example, we are under a legal obligation to continue to process your personal information.</li><li><strong>Porting:</strong> You have the right to request that your personal information is ported to you.</li><li><strong>Complaints:</strong> If you believe that your data protection rights may have been breached, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the country of your habitual residence, place of work or of the potential breach, or to seek a remedy through the courts. The supervisory authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, whose website at ico.org.uk provides information on how you can lodge a complaint.</li></ul><p>When we ask you to supply us with information we will make it clear whether the information we are asking for must be supplied so that we can provide the products and services to you, or whether the supply of any information we ask for is optional. For example, registration is mandatory to use U on most platforms, and certain minimum details must be submitted in order to enter our competitions.</p><h5>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information For</h5><p>We will retain your personal information, whether or not your account is active, for as long as we reasonably believe it necessary to fulfil our business purposes or to comply with applicable law, audit requirements, regulatory requests or orders from competent courts. We will then delete or anonymise it. For example, we will normally delete or anonymise your U  or UKTV Press account after 2 years of inactivity, but we will email you to warn you first.</p><h5>Links</h5><p>The UKTV Digital Services may contain links to other websites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from our UKTV Digital Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your personal information.</p><h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><p>If our privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page (displaying a version date at the bottom of the page); and where required, we will notify you of such changes either by email or when you log in.
