For example, access to features or Content may be temporarily unavailable while we carry out maintenance or for other technical reasons.</p>
<p>7.3  You have certain rights and protections under the law (including that We do not exclude or limit Our liability to you for any death or personal injury caused by Our negligence, for fraud or for fraudulent misrepresentation) and nothing in these Terms and Conditions will affect those rights and protections. Where the law does allow Us to exclude or limit Our liability, We are not responsible or liable to you for any:</p>

<p>9.3 These Terms and Conditions shall not be enforceable by any person who is not a party to these Terms and Conditions, except by any other UKTV group company or UKTV connected party.</p>
<p>9.4 If any part or provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that part or provision shall be deleted from these Terms and Conditions, but the remainder of these Terms and Conditions shall continue to apply.</p>
<p>9.5 We may transfer Our rights under these Terms and Conditions to another business without your consent, but We will make sure that your rights are not adversely affected as a result. You are not allowed to transfer your rights under these Terms and Conditions to anyone without Our prior written consent.</p>

By accessing or using the Digital Services you agree that the Courts of England and Wales shall have jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions or their subject matter or formation, unless you live elsewhere to England and Wales in the United Kingdom and then you can choose to bring a claim in the courts of the part of the United Kingdom in which you live.</p>
<p>10.2 The Digital Services are only intended to be accessed and used in the United Kingdom. UKTV does not guarantee that the materials available on the Digital Services are appropriate, will be available for use or will comply with local laws in other jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom.
