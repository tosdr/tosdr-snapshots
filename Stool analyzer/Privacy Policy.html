</h3>
<p>
    When you use StoolAnalyzer.com, you trust us with your information. This Privacy policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of StoolAnalyzer.com account holders.

</p>


<h3>
    Collection and use of non-personal information
</h3>
<p>
    We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an StoolAnalyzer.com product is used so that we can better understand customer behaviour and improve our products, services, and advertising.

<h3>
    Cookies and other technologies
</h3>
<p>
    As is true of most Internet services, we may gather some information automatically and store it in log files.

StoolAnalyzer.com may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
</p>
<p>
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the StoolAnalyzer.com website.

                                There is nothing more natural than pooing.
                                Everyone does it, sometimes several times a day.
                                It doesn't matter if you are young or old, rich or poor, a queen or the president...
                                Even the Pope needs to take a poo.
                                Please visit often to analyze your poo.
