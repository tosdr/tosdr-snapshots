In respect of account holders, we grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access SimpleMMO and the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.<br>
Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to:<br>
•	license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services, SimpleMMO, our website, or any content made available through our website, SimpleMMO, or the Services; <br>

You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.<br>
<br/>
<strong>3.	Your Account and Account Security </strong><br/>
Using SimpleMMO requires you to create an account with us (an "Account") and provide us with a username, email password, and certain other information about you. As part of creating your Account (or at any point thereafter) you may also create an avatar or “sprite”; you may upload your own sprite in exchange for virtual currency or choose from the available options. <br>
When creating your Account or uploading a sprite, you must not choose a username/sprite that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates SimpleMMO staff or administrators or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements, Acceptable Use Policy or Game Rules. We reserve the right to make such assessment in our sole discretion, change any username, delete any sprite, for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate. <br>
You are solely responsible for the security of your Account. If you choose, or you are provided with, a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential. You must not disclose it to any third party.<br>
You must maintain the security of your Account and we recommend you use a strong password that is unique to your Account and not used across other websites or services.<br>
If you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission, or if you use a password which becomes compromised due to its use on another website or service, you must notify us immediately at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e0d17130e121b1313113e191f121f161f1a1d0c1b1f0a17081b501d1113">[email&#160;protected]</a>. <br>
You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval. <br>

Full details on how we use this information and why providing by you when creating your Account can be found in our Privacy Policy. <br>
<br/>
<Strong>4.	Membership and Virtual Currency</strong><br/>
SimpleMMO is free to play and we aim to keep it that way. However, certain premium features are available to purchase either through our membership subscription or in exchange for purchasing “Diamonds” for real money.<br>
You may purchase a membership subscription or Diamonds within SimpleMMO (both the app and desktop variants of the game) by providing your debit card, credit card, or other payment information. We use third-party payment processors (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) to process your payments and will share your payment information with them. All card details you provide are stored by our trusted third-party payment providers (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) and are not stored by us.<br>
<br/>
<strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE READ.</strong><br/>
Both the purchase of Diamonds and the membership are subject to a number of conditions and restrictions.<br/><br>

Memberships are rolling monthly renewing automatically at the end of your subscription period and your chosen payment method will be automatically charged. We reserve the right to amend, modify or remove certain aspects of membership benefits (including the monthly subscription price), from time to time, in our absolute discretion. Where we do so, we will notify you of these changes in advance, usually through the release notes section within the game.<br/><br>

You can find details on your membership, including how to cancel your membership, within the “Settings” section of SimpleMMO or via the Google Play Store subscription area depending on your method of payment.<br/><br> 

Diamonds can only be redeemed within SimpleMMO; however, Diamonds or any other virtual currency we may make available to you through SimpleMMO have no inherent or monetary value and are not your own private property, rather they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Galahad Creative Ltd product.<br/><br>

We do not provide any cash or refunds for Diamonds (except as required by law) and we may impose additional restrictions relating to the purchase and/or redemption of Diamonds. Where we do, we will notify you of these changes in advance, usually through the release notes section within the game.<br/><br>

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, DIAMONDS OR ANY OTHER VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND/OR MICROCREDITS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU HAVE NO CASH VALUE, DO NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF MONEY AT ANY TIME.<br/><br>

<br/>
<strong>5.	Payment Information & Refunds</strong><br/>
All purchases, be it for membership or for virtual currency, such as Diamonds, require you to provide a valid debit card, credit card, or other accepted payment information. We use third-party payment processors (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) to process your payments and will share your payment information with them. All card details you provide are stored by our trusted third-party payment provider Stripe (or Google Pay, if you purchase directly through your Android device) and are not stored by us. Payments may be displayed as "Galahad Creative Ltd." on your credit statement.<br/>
If you buy any of our paid for features (“Premium Features”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to any additional terms specific to those Premium Features. Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your paid services. <br/>
All subscription-based features (such as memberships) will renew automatically at the end of each subscription period, and your payment method will automatically be charged the current fee and taxes applicable to the new subscription period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date.<br/>
You also agree that:<br/>
•	Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location and that we have absolute discretion in determining any applicable exchange or conversion rate.<br/><br/>

•	The taxes payable by you in respect of the Premium Features you have purchased may be based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.<br/><br/>

•	We may store (either directly or through our trusted third-party payment provider) and continue billing your payment method, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to pay for other Services you may buy.<br/><br/>

•	We may change our fees or benefits associated with the Premium Features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features.<br/><br/>
In respect of any purchased made through the SimpleMMO store, typically:<br/><Br/>
-	Diamonds purchased via Google Play, Apple App Store or Stripe can be refunded if an administrator is contacted within 24 hours and no Diamonds associated with that purchase have been spent within SimpleMMO;<br/>
-	We may refund you in respect of any in-game reward purchases you make in the form of Diamonds only, where an administrator is contacted within 48 hours of purchase.<br/><br/>

This is only applicable to the following rewards:<br/>
* Custom Avatar<br/>
* Item Rename<br/>
* Custom Colour on Username<br/>
* Custom Gradient Colour on Username.<br/>
<br/>
You also may change your user-submitted reward up to (2) times within 3 days of purchase. This is limited to the following rewards:<br/>
* Custom Avatar<br/>
* Item Rename<br/>
* Custom Colour on Username<br/>
* Custom Gradient Colour on Username.<br/>
<br/>
Outside the above policy, we are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to memberships or Diamonds when:<br/>
•	You have lost your access to a Premium Feature due to being suspended or banned from SimpleMMO, where we have reason to believe you have violated these terms or the Game Rules;<br/>
•	Those purchases were as a result of your Account being compromised (unless it was as a result of our negligence);<br/>
•	You have been the victim of in-game scamming.<br/>

<strong>8.	Interacting with other SimpleMMO users</strong><br/>

SimpleMMO is an interactive game and we strive to keep SimpleMMO a fun, safe, and friendly environment. That said, when you interact with users through our Interactive Services, we have a few house rules we require you to adhere to. “Interactive Services” means the in-game chat features in SimpleMMO and any chat rooms, bulletin boards, comments and public feedback pages we make available.<br/><br/>

We require that when posting any content, expressions or opinions through our Interactive Services (a “Contribution”) you comply with the following standards. We at SimpleMMO will determine, in our discretion, whether a Contribution breaches these guidelines.<br/><br/>

Any Contribution must:<br/>
•	Be accurate (where it states facts).<br/>
•	Be genuinely held (where it states opinions).<br/>
•	Comply with the laws of England and Wales and in any country from which it is posted.<br/>
<br/>
A Contribution must not:<br/>
•	Be defamatory of any person.<br/>
•	Be obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory.<br/>
•	Be intended to bully, insult, intimidate or humiliate.<br/>
•	Promote sexually explicit material or sexual depictions of minors.<br/>
•	Promote violence.<br/>
•	Promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.<br/>
•	Infringe any copyright, database right or trade mark of any other person.<br/>
•	Be likely to deceive any person.<br/>
•	Breach any legal duty owed to a third party, such as a contractual duty or a duty of confidence.<br/>
•	Promote any illegal activity.<br/>
•	Be in contempt of court.<br/>
•	Be threatening, abuse or invade another's privacy, or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety.<br/>
•	Be likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person.<br/>
•	Impersonate any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person.<br/>
•	Give the impression that the Contribution emanates, or is someway associated with, SimpleMMO or from any other company or organisation, if this is not the case.<br/>
•	Advocate, promote, incite any party to commit, or assist any unlawful or criminal act.<br/>
•	Contain a statement which you know or believe, or have reasonable grounds for believing, that members of the public to whom the statement is, or is to be, published are likely to understand as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.<br/>
•	Contain any advertising or promote any services or web links to other sites.<br/>
•	Contain spam or be intended to be spam.<br/>
<br/>
We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for minors) from third parties when they use any Interactive Service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not. <br/><br/>

The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor (that being a person under 18) is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an Interactive Service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. <br/><br/>

Where we do moderate SimpleMMO or an Interactive Service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.<br/><br/>
