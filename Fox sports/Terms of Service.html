Description of FSIM Services and Acceptance of Terms of Use Including Arbitration of Disputes</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC ("FSIM," "our," "we" or "us") has developed this Terms of Use Agreement to describe the terms that govern your use of the FSIM Services (defined below).

FSIM is based in the United States and the FSIM Services, including Applications, are hosted and provided in the United States.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">FSIM furnishes the FSIM Sites, Applications, and other FSIM Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment. Please read through this Agreement carefully. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE APPLICATION, OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT", YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PRIVACY POLICY. This includes your agreement to any future modifications and to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations (collectively, "Applicable Law"). FSIM may modify this Agreement at any time, and each such modification will be effective upon posting on the FSIM Sites or within the Application. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the FSIM Sites, Applications, or any other FSIM Services following any modification of this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the Agreement as modified. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, 1) FSIM does not grant you a license to download, install or use the Applications or other FSIM Services, 2) please do not use FSIM Sites and discontinue use of all FSIM Services immediately.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">Your access to and/or use of certain FSIM Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions applicable to such FSIM Services, in addition to this Agreement, and may require you to download software or Content (as defined below). In the event of a conflict between any such additional terms and this Agreement, such additional terms will prevail.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">PLEASE NOTE THAT THE "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT" SECTION <a name="Arbitration_Agreement" id="undefined"></a><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/terms-of-use#_Arbitration_Agreement_and"><strong>BELOW</strong></a> CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE (i) WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT AND (ii) YOU AND FSIM WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

Registration and Security</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">Use of the FSIM Services is limited to users 13 years of age and older. Some FSIM Services require you to create an account (including setting up a Fox Sports Interactive Media credential and password) to participate in or to secure additional FSIM Services, such as viewing and commenting on FSIM Content (defined below), purchasing FSIM Site Products, creating an FSIM Site profile and signing up for specific FSIM Site newsletters. To make it easier for you to create an account and interact with participating FSIM Services without having to maintain multiple sign-in credentials, FSIM has created the universal Fox Sports Interactive Media credential. The Fox Sports Interactive Media credential allows you to sign into participating FSIM Services with one email and password. In addition to your Fox Sports Interactive Media credential, you will have the ability to create an FSIM Site specific profile, which may include an FSIM Site username and profile, as part of your account. You take full responsibility for your participation on FSIM. As a condition of using certain features of FSIM, you may be required to register on FSIM and/or select a username and password. All registration information you submit directly to us or through a Third-Party Service (defined below) to create an account must be accurate and must be kept updated by you. Your failure to do so will constitute a breach of the Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account. You may not (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of another person without appropriate authorization. FSIM reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a username, in its sole discretion. It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes in such information, including, but not limited to your contact information.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all your passwords and are responsible for all use of your account. It is therefore critical that you do not share your account information with anyone. You may be held liable for losses incurred by FSIM, FSIM Affiliates (defined below) or any other FSIM user or visitor in the event someone else uses your account as a result of your failure to keep your account information secure and confidential and you agree to indemnify FSIM and all FSIM Affiliates from any third-party claims arising from such actions. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another member or subscriber at any time and not to allow any other person to use your account. You agree to notify FSIM immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of, or access to, your account or password. FSIM shall retain the right to change your username, but no obligation, for any reason, including, without limitation, if the username you have selected violates this Agreement. FSIM shall also retain the right, but no obligation, to review any profile pictures provided by you.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>3. Access</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">The FSIM Site and Applications are intended solely for your personal and non-commercial use. FSIM may change, suspend or discontinue the FSIM Site (or any feature thereof) at any time. FSIM may also impose limits on certain features and services offered on the FSIM Site or restrict your access to parts or all of the FSIM Site without notice or liability. You acknowledge that from time to time the FSIM Site may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs which FSIM may undertake from time to time; or (iii) causes beyond the control of FSIM or which are not reasonably foreseeable by FSIM.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">To access certain video content via the Application, you will be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page, where you will be required to register directly with your television content provider. Please contact your television content provider directly for questions on your account, including how to access or cancel your account. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider’s privacy policy, rather than the FSIM Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any television content provider’s use of information collected via the Application.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>4. Termination</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">Unless terminated by FSIM in its sole discretion, this Agreement remains in full force and effect while you use the FSIM Services. You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, in the following ways: (i) to terminate your account please send an email to the applicable FSIM Site’s feedback account <a href="https://help.fox.com/fox/s/article/How-do-I-contact-FOX-Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>listed here</strong></a>, Subject: Terminate FSIM Account. Please list the specific FSIM Site account you wish to terminate.; (ii) to terminate a specific FSIM Site newsletter subscription please log on to the specific FSIM Site account profile page and select your newsletter preferences or click the unsubscribe link on the bottom of the FSIM Site newsletter. FSIM may terminate your account, any subscription (both free and paid) and/or access to all (or any portion of) the FSIM Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or any explanation, and shall have no liability to you for such termination. Furthermore, even after your account subscription and/or access to the FSIM Services is terminated by you or FSIM, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect with respect to your past and future use of the FSIM Services. If we terminate your user account, subscription and/or access to the FSIM Services (or any portion of the FSIM Services) you may not create a new account, purchase a new subscription or try to access the FSIM Services without FSIM’s prior written approval. You agree that your account and/or subscription is non-transferable. Any rights to your account and/or the FSIM Services terminate upon your death.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>5. Fees</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">You acknowledge that FSIM reserves the right to charge a fee for any portion of the FSIM Services. FSIM will provide you with advance notice of any such fees, including any change in the amount of such fees, and a way to cancel your account and/or subscription in the event you do not wish to pay the modified fee. If you continue to use the FSIM Services after the applicable fee has been imposed or increased, you are expressly agreeing to the subscription fee or increase thereto and you will be responsible for paying such fee for the balance of your subscription service. You will not be entitled to a refund of any unused portion of such fees or other payments if FSIM suspends or terminates your account, and/or access to an FSIM Site (or any portion of the FSIM Site), due to your breach of this Agreement or violation of Applicable Law, as determined by FSIM, in its sole discretion.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>6. Purchasing FSIM Services or Products</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">In connection with a purchase of any service, subscription (including any premium subscription) or product on or in connection with the FSIM Sites or other FSIM Services (collectively, "FSIM Site Products"), you may be required to provide personal information, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card and billing information (collectively, "Personal Financial Information"), to an independent third party selected by, but not affiliated with, FSIM (the "Processor"). Where the Processor is responsible for collecting, transmitting and/or processing your Personal Financial Information and, in some instances, for fulfilling your order, the collection, transmission and processing of your Personal Financial Information and any and all payment obligations for FSIM Site Products shall be governed by the terms of use/service and privacy policy(ies) of the Processor. If you make a purchase of a FSIM Site Product, you are warranting that you are authorized to make the purchase using the form of payment that you provide to the Processor. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase a FSIM Site Product. If you purchase certain subscription based FSIM Site Products, your subscription will be automatically renewed and the credit card you provided to the Processor for such FSIM Site Product will be charged per the billing cycle of your subscription (e.g., monthly, 3-month, 6-month, annual), unless you cancel the subscription prior to the automatic renewal date of the subscription. The renewal charge for your subscription shall be the same as the original purchase price, unless you are otherwise notified in advance.

Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure, Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">So that FSIM can maintain the ability to offer you and other users the FSIM Service, you and we agree to the following mechanisms for resolving any Dispute between us:</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">a.<strong> Dispute.  </strong>The term "<strong>Dispute</strong>" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and FSIM, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term "Dispute" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any disputes, actions, claims, or controversies between you and FSIM that arise from or in any way relate to or concern any Content, the Site or services provided by FSIM including but not limited to the FSIM Services (as defined above), this Section 22, any other aspect of this Agreement or any prior versions of this Agreement (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Section 22 are that: (i) each of you and FSIM retains the right to sue in small claims court; (ii) each of you and FSIM may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights; and (iii) each of you and FSIM may bring suit in court to determine the enforceability of Sub-Section 22.b. and/or Sub-Section 22.k.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">b. <strong>Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process.</strong> You and FSIM agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective, and mutually beneficial outcome.  Therefore, if either you or FSIM wants to bring or resolve a Dispute, you or FSIM must follow the mandatory informal dispute resolution process as a precondition to the ability to file an arbitration demand or lawsuit:</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">i. <strong>Notice.</strong> You or FSIM must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the FSIM Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested, including damages, if any, and a detailed calculation for them. Your Notice also must contain your email address and (if different) the email address associated with your FSIM account (if you have an account with FSIM). Our Notice must also be sent to your email address associated with your FSIM account (if you have an account with FSIM), and you consent to receive any such Notice as part of these dispute resolution terms. You and we must include in any Notice to each other a personally signed statement (from you or us—not from your or our counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice, and if you are represented by counsel, your signed statement authorizing FSIM to disclose your FSIM account details to your attorney while seeking to resolve your claim. We each must individualize our Notice, meaning it can concern only our Dispute and no other person’s Dispute. You must send your Notice to FSIM by email to <a href="mailto:Arbitration-Notice@fox.com">Arbitration-Notice@fox.com</a> or by mail to: Arbitration Notice of Dispute, Fox Corporation, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California, 90067. In the case of a Dispute initiated by you or us, it is the sender’s responsibility to prove that the sender provided the notice in the manner that is required in this paragraph.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">ii.<strong> Good Faith Effort to Informally Resolve Dispute. </strong>After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and FSIM agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and FSIM agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If you and FSIM do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or FSIM may commence a proceeding as noted below.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">c. <strong>Arbitration</strong> <strong>Agreement</strong>.  If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 60 days of the submission of the Notice in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures, FSIM, including FSIM Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any Dispute between you and FSIM, regarding any aspect of your relationship with FSIM, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court, subject to the exceptions noted in Sub-Section 22.g. below. Thus, subject to those exceptions, <strong>you and FSIM agree to give up the right to sue in court, including that you and FSIM agree to waive their right to a jury trial.</strong> </p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">d. <strong>Controlling Law Regarding Arbitration Process and Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.  This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions in Section 22 related to the arbitration process. The agreements in Section 22 shall survive termination of the Agreement. Any original action to compel arbitration under Section 4 of the FAA (or analogous state law) must be brought in a state or federal court located in New York City, unless mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate, then that issue shall be determined by the laws of the State of New York. Any arbitration between you and FSIM will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to their then-applicable rules, including their mass arbitration supplementary rules and mass arbitration fee schedule, as applicable, as modified by Section 22. AAA’s rules and fee schedules can be found at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration as described in Sub-Section 22.k. below, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. If you and FSIM cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the AAA’s rules.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">e. <strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Arbitration Provider.  </strong>If AAA is not available to arbitrate, including because it is not able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of Section 22, including those described in Sub-Section 22.k., the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 that is able to administer the arbitration(s) consistent with the rules, procedures, and terms of this Section 22, including, as applicable, Sub-Section 22.k. Section 22 will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. For arbitrations before the AAA, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and Optional Rules For Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">f. <strong>Filing</strong> <strong>Fee and Costs. </strong>The initiating party must pay all filing fees for the arbitration. Your and FSIM’s responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator costs will be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">g. <strong>Waiver of Fees and Costs.  </strong>You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the applicable arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, the state court of your residence, or the state court where the arbitration is brought, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, FSIM will pay the filing fees for you.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">h.<strong> Enforceability</strong> <strong>of Certain Provisions of Section 22.  </strong>Notwithstanding Sub-Section 22.c. through Sub-Section 22.g., a claim regarding enforceability of any portion of Sub-Section 22.b. and/or Sub-Section 22.k. must be brought in federal or state court. Courts shall have the exclusive authority to determine: (i) the enforceability of any or all of the procedures set forth in Sub-Section 22.b. and/or Sub-Section 22.k.; and (ii) if any or all the procedures set forth in Sub-Section 22.b. and/or Sub-Section 22.k. are unenforceable, whether that or those procedures are severable from the remaining provisions of Section 22 and the consequences of said severance.  If the court determines that Sub-Section 22.b. is enforceable, it will also decide whether the party seeking to arbitrate the Dispute complied with the process in Sub-Section 22.b. </p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">i.<strong> You</strong> <strong>and FSIM also agree to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and FSIM, including in arbitration and in state or federal court.  Therefore:</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">YOU AND FSIM MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">j. You understand there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow the dispute resolution process described in Section 22. Subject to Sub-Section 22.h, the arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve all issues relating to the parties’ Dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages); provided that they are recoverable under this Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">k. <strong>Related</strong> <strong>Cases and Mass Arbitrations.</strong> If your Notice involves claims similar to those of at least 25 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, or if FSIM asserts 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly-situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity, you and we agree that these claims will be related ("<strong>Related Cases</strong>"), and this shall be called a "<strong>Mass Arbitration</strong>." The following procedures will apply to a Mass Arbitration:</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">i. Acknowledgment <i>of Related Cases procedure.</i> If you or FSIM, or your or our counsel, files a demand for arbitration that has Related Cases, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Sub-Section 22.k.  If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Arbitration above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the proceedings described in this Sub-Section 22.k.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">ii. <i>Bellwether Arbitrations.</i> Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the "Initial Test Cases," to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither You nor FSIM will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and FSIM also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of Section 22 for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">iii. Global <i>Mediation.</i> Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims ("Global Mediation"), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the unresolved Disputes may then be administered by the arbitration provider pursuant to this Agreement’s Batch Arbitration provision below and the arbitrator’s fee schedule for mass filings, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation process.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">iv. Batch <i>Arbitration.</i> To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and FSIM agree that in the event the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation processes described above do not resolve the Disputes, the arbitration provider will (1) administer the remaining arbitration demands in batches of 50 demands per batch; (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ("Batch Arbitration"). The final award will provide for individual merit decisions for each separate claimant within the single batch arbitration award. If the arbitration provider will not administer the Batch Arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, then the arbitration provider’s mass arbitration fee schedule shall apply. AAA’s mass arbitration fee schedule is available on its website at <a href="http://www.adr.org/rules">www.adr.org/rules</a>.  For mass arbitrations before any other arbitration provider, if applicable, you and FSIM agree that its mass arbitration fee schedule shall apply, as necessary.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">v. Opting <i>Out. </i>If your claim is not resolved as part of the Bellwether Arbitration and Global Mediation process outlined above, the parties shall also have the opportunity to opt out of arbitration and bring the pending Dispute to the state or federal courts located in New York City, unless mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. The parties have 30 days of the failed Global Mediation process to opt out. This shall not provide an opportunity for either party to opt out of arbitration for other claims. You may opt out of arbitration by providing written notice of your intention to opt out to the arbitration provider and to Fox Corporation, Attention Arbitration Opt-Out, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California, 90067 via USPS Priority Mail or hand delivery, by email to <a href="mailto:Arbitration-OptOut@fox.com">Arbitration-OptOut@fox.com</a>, or by notice to the attorney representing FSIM in the arbitration proceeding. This written notice must be signed by you, even if it is also signed by your attorney. The written notice cannot be signed by an agent or other representative of yours in lieu of your signature. It must include a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of the Global Mediation process. FSIM may exercise its equivalent opt-out right by sending written notice to you or your attorney, agent, or representative if you are represented.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">vi. <strong>Enforcement </strong><i><strong>of Subsection.</strong></i> A Court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to enforce Section 22.k., including by injunctive, declaratory, or other relief.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">l. <strong>Live Testimony.</strong> You must appear to testify at any arbitration hearing personally, virtually, or in another manner authorized by law or the arbitration provider.  You agree that if you fail to appear in one of these forms to testify, you consent to have the arbitrator order that the case be closed immediately.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">m. <strong>Discovery and Information Exchange. </strong>Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and FSIM shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">n. <strong>Attorney’s Fees and Fee Shifting. </strong> Each of you and FSIM may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys’ fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit(s) the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys’ fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s).</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">o. <strong>Restrictions</strong> <strong>on Forms of Relief</strong>. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim, only as permitted by applicable law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief except those allowed under the law and this Agreement, including Section 19’s Limitation of Liability provision. The arbitrator also may not order you or FSIM to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you or FSIM, respectively, unless you or FSIM explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order, as applicable. Further, unless you and FSIM expressly agree, or subject to the provisions of Sub-Section 22.k. above, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours or ours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">p. <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> You and FSIM agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order. In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, you and FSIM agree that an order confirming the award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed. Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award. If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">q. <strong>Severability</strong> <strong>of Portions of Section 22. </strong>With the exception of Sub-Section 22.i. and Sub-Section 22.k. (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class and the Mass Arbitration procedure), if any part of Section 22 is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of Section 22 shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, either or both Sub-Section 22.i. or/and Sub-Section 22.k. is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the remainder of Section 22 and this paragraph shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing in which court actions against FSIM must be pursued and the choice of governing law will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">r. <strong>Court Proceedings</strong>. If a court issues a decision precluding or refusing to compel arbitration of any Dispute, the Dispute must be brought in the state or federal courts located in New York City, unless otherwise mandated by law to be filed in another state or federal court. For Disputes deemed not to be subject to arbitration, neither you nor FSIM shall be precluded from participating in a class-wide settlement of those claims if brought by another FSIM user or third party.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>23. Governing Law</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">Except with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and FSIM agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the FSIM Services.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE OR THE FSIM SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>24. Indemnity</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">You agree to indemnify and hold FSIM, its FSIM Affiliates, stations affiliated with FSIM, producers of FSIM content, each advertiser, sponsor and their advertising agencies, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use or misuse of the FSIM Sites or the FSIM Services (including, without, limitation, any use of your account, whether or not authorized by you), your breach of this Agreement, your violation of any rights of another or any Content that you Transmit through the FSIM Services.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>25. Unsolicited Submissions</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">FSIM does not knowingly accept, via the FSIM Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts. FSIM requests that you do not make any unsolicited submissions. Any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any FSIM or Affiliated FSIM creative work including, without limitation, a film, series, story, title or concept would be purely coincidental. If you do send any submissions to FSIM via the FSIM Services that are unsolicited (including but not limited to any Forum), however, you agree that (i) your unsolicited submissions are not being made in confidence or trust and that by making such submissions no contractual or fiduciary relationship is created between you and FSIM; (ii) any such unsolicited submissions and copyright become the property of and will be owned by FSIM (and are not User Content licensed by you to FSIM under "Your Proprietary Rights in and License to Your User Content") and may be used, copied, sublicensed, adapted, transmitted, distributed, publicly performed, published, displayed or deleted as FSIM sees fit; (iii) you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever in connection with such submissions; and (iv) by sending an unsolicited submission you waive the right to make any claim against FSIM or FSIM Affiliates relating to any unsolicited submissions by you, including, without limitation, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>26. Employment Opportunities</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">FSIM may, from time to time, post FSIM employment opportunities on the FSIM Services and/or invite users to submit resumes to it. If you choose to submit your name, contact information, resume and/or other personal information to FSIM in response to employment listings, you are authorizing FSIM to utilize this information for all lawful and legitimate hiring and employment purposes. FSIM also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to forward the information you submit to its FSIM Affiliates for legitimate business purposes. Nothing in this Agreement or contained in the FSIM Services will constitute a promise by FSIM to contact, interview, hire or employ any individual who submits information to it, nor will anything in this Agreement or contained in the FSIM Services constitute a promise that FSIM will review any or all of the information submitted to it by users of the FSIM Services.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>27. Government End Users</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">If the Application and related documentation are supplied to or purchased by or on behalf of the United States Government, then the Application is deemed to be a "commercial item" as defined by 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, and consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" for purposes of compliance with 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 or § 227.7202. Rights of the United States Government shall not exceed the minimum rights set forth in 48 C.F.R. § 52.227-19. All other terms and conditions of this Agreement apply. </p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88"><strong>28. Other</strong></p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">The failure of FSIM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The Section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">This Agreement sets forth the entire, final and exclusive agreement between you and FSIM with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, between the Parties related to such subject matter.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">You agree that any notices the FSIM may be required by Applicable Law to send to you will be effective upon FSIM’s sending an e-mail message to the e-mail address you have on file with FSIM or publishing such notices on the informational page(s) of the FSIM Services.</p><p class="mg-t-b-20 ff-h fs-16 lh-1pt88">You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and FSIM as a result of this Agreement or your use of the FSIM Services.

The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages); provided that they are recoverable under this Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
