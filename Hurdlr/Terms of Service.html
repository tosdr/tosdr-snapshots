YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY FAILURE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE OR OTHER MATERIALS SUPPLIED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH SERVICES, SHALL BE FOR HURDLR TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO EFFECTUATE AN ADJUSTMENT OR REPAIR OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICE. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT HURDLR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. In some jurisdictions, limitations of liability are not permitted. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitations may not apply to you.</p><p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p><p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Hurdlr, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates, from and against any and all liability, damages, losses, claims, expenses of any kind (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees) directly or indirectly related to (1) your breach of the Terms of Service; (2) the User Content you submit, post, or transmit through the Services; or (3) your use of the Services.</p><p><strong>TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL</strong></p><p>Either party may terminate the Terms of Service for any or no cause, at any time. After termination, you shall no longer access or utilize the Services. The provisions of this Agreement which by their intent or meaning intended to survive such termination, including without limitation the provisions relating to disclaimer of warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnification, shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service and any termination of your use of or subscription to the Services and shall continue to apply indefinitely.</p><p><strong>SEVERABILITY</strong></p><p>If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, you agree that every attempt shall be made to give effect to the parties&#x27; intentions as reflected in that provision, and the remaining provisions contained in the Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p><p>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Hurdlr agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Hurdlr. Hurdlr’s address for such notices is 5511 Cornish Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, Attention: Legal.</p><p>BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Hurdlr are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="#" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $1,000, Hurdlr will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hurdlr may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p><p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Hurdlr agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Hurdlr and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND HURDLR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Hurdlr otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p><p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in Montgomery County, Maryland. You and Hurdlr agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the Maryland state and Federal courts located in Bethesda, Maryland have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Hurdlr agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p><p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></p><p>You and Hurdlr agree that, other than as set forth under the subsection entitled “Waiver Of Right To Be A Plaintiff Or Class Member In A Purported Class Action Or Representative Proceeding” in the above, if any portion of the section entitled “Dispute Resolution” is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the section will be given full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the subsection entitled “Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution” in the section above is found to be illegal or unenforceable, neither you nor Hurdlr will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of that subsection that is found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Bethesda, Maryland, and you and Hurdlr agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><p>Except as expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to choice of law principles.</p><p><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or concerns with respect to these Terms of Service or the Services you may contact a representative of Hurdlr at info [at] hurdlr [dot] com or by mail to 5511 Cornish Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814.</p><p>© 2016 Hurdlr,
