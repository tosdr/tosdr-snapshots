<h3>Cookies and beacons</h3>
<p>Our third-party advertising partners use cookies in combination with web beacons to serve ads and to analyze the effectiveness of the ads that they serve.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file containing a string of characters that a website sends your computer. It records information necessary for certain website functions, such as remembering your preferences or settings.</p>
<p>A cookie will not allow us or any third-party to learn any personally identifiable information that you have not otherwise disclosed.</p>
<p>The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you <a href="http://www.blackle.com/cookie-settings/">change your browser's cookie settings</a> to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
