<h4><u>We engage in interest-based advertising.</u></h4>
<p>We or our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include on mobile applications (&quot;apps&quot;).</p>

They also include ads we think are relevant based upon your browsing habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads on our behalf. They might be about our products and brands or about other companies&#39; products and brands.</p>

<h4><u>How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?</u></h4>
<p>To help us decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.</p>
<p>We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That information might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.</p>

<h4><u>You can control certain tracking tools.</u></h4>

To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go <a href=https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html>here</a>.

We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.</p>
