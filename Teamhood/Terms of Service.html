The Client understands and accepts that the Software collects some personal data from its users. The personal data collected and the purposes for collection, use and transfer of personal data, is described in the Privacy Policy document, published on the Website teamhood.com, as it may change from time to time, depending on the scope of services, provided by&nbsp;Eylean.&nbsp;<br>3. The Client confirms to have provided voluntarily to&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;any personal data, connected to the signing and the execution of these Terms of use, and gives the permission to&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;for collecting, processing and storage of personal data, as well as transfer of this data, when this is necessary for providing the services by&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;or when it is demanded by applicable law.&nbsp;<br>4. The Client shall be responsible for entering somebody else’s personal data without due authorization.&nbsp;<br>5. The Client shall be obliged to obtain the explicit agreement of all third parties, whose personal data is entered by the Client or in any way affected by the use of the Software by the Client, for gathering, processing and storage of their personal data (if any) and to perform the necessary registrations and other activities, in order to legally collect, process, and store such data (if such are required by law).

The administrator shall be given the opportunity to accept or deny the new service/functionality of the Software, as well as the transfer of personal data, if required. If the administrator accepts the new service/functionality and gives his/her consent for the transfer, it shall be considered that the Client has given his consent for the transfer on behalf of all third parties, whose personal data is affected. Personal data shall be then transferred only after and if&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;has received the consent of the Client through his account administrator as described above. The consent of the Client shall be valid for all personal data, entered by the Client in the Software, including personal data of third parties. It shall be the Client’s responsibility to acquire the consent of such third parties on the transfer. The Client acknowledges that&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;does not control the content, entered by the Client and has no contact with any third parties, whose personal data the Client may enter in the software.

Even if the Client has not objected initially to the transfer, the Client may at all times inform in writing&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;that he/she does not want his personal data to be transferred any more to third parties in case of new service integration and&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;shall not transfer in the future such data after the date on which&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;has received the communication from the Client. However, if the Client has initially accepted such transfer and has not later on informed&nbsp;Eylean&nbsp;in writing about his/her objection, it shall be considered that the Client has given his consent for data transfers until the date of the objection. If the Client objects to such transfer, the Client shall not be able to use those new/integrated services/functionalities anymore.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">PROPRIETARY RIGHTS&nbsp;</h2><p>1.
