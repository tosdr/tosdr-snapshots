<p>Our Services offer Users a platform to access or create workouts, training programs, and exercise based content, and to help share and achieve their fitness goals through a uniquely connected, community experience.

Skimble assumes no responsibility for a User's compliance with or fulfillment of any Training Relationship with other Users, including early termination of a Training Relationship by a User, or duties to third parties, or compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Skimble does not endorse any Trainer, Client, Training Service, or User Content.</p>

NO OPINION, ADVICE OR STATEMENT OF SKIMBLE OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, ADVERTISERS, SPONSORS, AGENTS, MEMBERS OR VISITORS, WHETHER MADE THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ON THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHERWISE, SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to You insofar as they relate to implied warranties.</p>
<p><b>16. Limitation of Liability</b></p>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF THE SKIMBLE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE, INCOME OR PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, LOSS OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF ASSETS OR SECURITIES, OR DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY ANY USER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM SKIMBLE OR THE USER CONTENT, OR FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETIONS OF FILES OR EMAILS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SKIMBLE'S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SYSTEMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE).

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SKIMBLE AND THE OTHER SKIMBLE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED (A) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO SKIMBLE, IF ANY, OR (B) $100 (WHICHEVER IS LESS).

<p><b>23. Miscellaneous</b></p>
<p>The Term of Use and Our Privacy Policy (and, with respect to Trainer, the Trainer Terms of Use) constitute the sole and entire agreement between You and Skimble with respect to the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Services. If the application of any provision of these Terms of Use to any particular facts or circumstances shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, then (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision as applied to any other particular facts or circumstances, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (b) such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties. Our failure to exercise any right or remedy available upon Your breach of these Terms of Use or the failure by Us to demand the prompt performance of any obligation hereunder, shall not be deemed a waiver of (a) Our rights or remedies, (b) the requirement of punctual performance or (c) any right or remedy in connection with a subsequent breach or default on Your part. No waiver of any of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such terms and condition or any other term or condition. Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by facsimile, postpaid registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or electronic mail. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and You may not make any representations or bind the Company in any manner. </p>
<p><b>24. Governing Laws; Statute of Limitations</b></p>
<p>These Terms of Use and Your use of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and shall be considered to have been made and accepted in the State of California. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services, the Terms of Use, or any services or information available through Third Party Platforms, must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause or action arose regardless of any statutes or law to the contrary. In the event any such claim or cause of action is not filed within such 1-year period, such claim or cause of action are forever barred.</p>
<p><b>25. Dispute Resolution: Arbitration, Class Action Waiver, and Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p><b><u>Please read this section carefully. It is part of Your contract with Skimble and affects Your rights.</u></b></p>
<p>Except for a claim by Skimble of infringement or misappropriation of Skimble's intellectual property rights, any and all disputes between You and Skimble arising under or related in any way to these Terms of Use or the Services that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis as described in this Arbitration Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to Your use of the Services and Terms of Use, and applies to You and Skimble, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.</p>
<p>Before any party may seek arbitration, the party must first send a written "Notice of Dispute" to the other party describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. Any notice to Skimble should be sent to 601 Capp Street, San Francisco, CA 94110. After the Notice of Dispute is received, You and Skimble may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If You and Skimble are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. </p>
<p>If either party brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or either party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other party may ask a court to force the parties to "compel" arbitration to resolve the dispute. Either party can also ask a court to stop a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SKIMBLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND SKIMBLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. THIS APPLIES TO ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY.</p>
<p>The Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this section, will govern the arbitration. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, You and Skimble must abide by the following rules: (A) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (B) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in San Francisco, California. The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated will be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of Skimble's intellectual property rights will be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to its choice of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.</p>
<p><b>26. Changes or Clarifications to Our Terms of Use</b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time. If We change these Terms of Use, We will update the Effective Date listed above, and will also notify You by either sending an email to the User email address on file or by posting a notice through Our Services. If You continue to use the Services, after the effective date of any change, then such access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of and an agreement to follow and be bound by the Terms of Use as updated. The updated Terms of Use supersedes all previous Terms of Use. If You do not agree with Our updated Terms of Use, You may not use Our Services. </p>
<p>If You have any questions about these Terms of Service You can contact Us at support@skimble.com or by mail to 601 Capp Street, San Francisco, CA 94110.</p>
