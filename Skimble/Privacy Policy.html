We will access Your phone’s contact list for the purpose of letting You identify contacts who are Skimble users. We do not store Your phone’s contact list, and it is deleted immediately after it is used for this purpose.</p>

<p><i><u>User Contributions</u></i></p>
<p>You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, "posted")on public areas of the Services, or transmitted to other Users or third parties (collectively, "User Contributions").

We may use this information in a de-identified, aggregated, and anonymous way to monitor and analyze use of the Services, and to increase the Services’ functionality and user-friendliness.

<p>If You do not want Us to use Your information in the ways described herein, please adjust Your user preferences in Your account profile or email Us at support@skimble.com. </p>
<p><b>5. Disclosure of Your Information</b></p>
<p>We may disclose aggregated information about Our users and Services as described herein, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.</p>
<p>We will only disclose information that We collect or that You provide as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· To Our subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· To contractors, service providers, and other third parties We use to support Our business or who provide services on Our behalf, including but not limited to payment processing, data analysis, marketing and promotional services, and customer service. These companies, while providing these services on Our behalf, companies may access Your Account Information. They are, however, required to use such information as directed by Skimble for the express purposes for which We have engaged them.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· To government or law enforcement officials or private parties in response to lawful requests, if Skimble is under a duty to disclose or share the information in order to comply with any applicable legal obligation, to apply and enforce Our Terms of Use, to respond to claims and legal process, to protect the property and rights of Skimble, Our Users, or a third party, or to prevent or stop any fraudulent, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Skimble Inc.’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Skimble Inc. about Our Users is among the assets transferred.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· When You use the Services, We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain Technical Data and/or other aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information among Our Users. We may also allow advertisers to collect Technical Information or aggregated information, which they may share with Us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer You targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize Your User experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services You see will appeal to You (this practice is commonly known as behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end User activity to improve Your experience). We do not control third parties’ collection or use of Your information to serve interest­based advertising. However these third parties may provide You with ways to choose not to have Your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI")on the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">NAI’s Site</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· To fulfill the purpose for which You provide it, for any other purpose disclosed by Us when You provide the information, or as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">· If You use a Skimble mobile application on a Samsung Android Device and have chosen to enable Samsung’s S Health platform, then You consent to sharing personal health data to the S Health platform. This data is used to provide synchronization between services and may be included in broad health data analysis. Similarly, You can choose to connect and share Your Skimble and Skimble mobile application service data with HealthKit including Apple’s iOS Health application. In doing so, You consent to sharing Your personal health data with Apple and the information You provide to HealthKit is then governed by Apple’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. We do not share Your health-related service data without Your consent.</p>
<p><b>6. Accessing, Updating, and Correcting Your Information</b></p>
<p>If You would like to review or change Your Account Information or Profile Information, You may do so by logging into Our Services and visiting Your account profile page.</p>
<p>You may also send Us an email at support@skimble.com to request access to, correct, or delete any Account Information or Profile Information that You have provided to Us. We cannot delete Your personal information except by also deleting Your User Account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if We believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
<p>If You decide to delete Your Skimble Account, please be aware that some or all of Profile Information or User Contributions may still remain visible to others, including but not limited to comments, postings, or other voluntary submissions and information posted through the Services. A request to delete Your Account will not result in the removal of information collected and already put in aggregate form or information that cannot, in Our sole discretion, be removed without causing undue burden to Skimble. We are neither able nor obligated to remove any of Your information from any Third Party Platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that Your Account has been deleted does not mean that Your Information has been deleted in its entirety from Our servers, and it also does not mean that the information has been deleted from the servers of any Third Party Platform You use to access the Services. We may retain backup copies of Your information, including personal information on Our servers or databases (and/or any authorized third party servers or databases We use) to assist with any legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce Our agreements. </p>
<p><b>7. Use of Services from Outside the United States</b></p>
<p>These Services are hosted in the United States. If You choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that You may be transferring Your information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. By providing information through the Services, You consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>
<p><b>8. California Do Not Track Disclosure</b></p>
<p>We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals in browsers. While We collect personally identifiable information from You as described earlier in this Policy, We do not collect personally identifiable information from You to monitor Your online activities across third party websites or online services.</p>
<p><b>9. Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p>If You are a California resident, the California Civil Code (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83) gives You the right to request information on how to exercise Your disclosure choice options from companies conducting business in California. To request such information, either send an email to support@skimble.com or contact Us via postal mail, postage pre-paid, at: Skimble, Inc., Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, 601 Capp Street, San Francisco, CA 94110.</p>
<p>All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include Your name, street address (if You would like a response via postal mail), city, state, and zip code. We will not accept requests via telephone or fax. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
<p><b>10. Data Security</b></p>
<p>The security of Our User information is important to Us. When You enter information through Our Services, like usernames, passwords, and credit card information, We encrypt the transmission of that information using industry-standard secure socket layer encryption technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to Us, both during transmission and once We receive it. Although You can submit credit card or other payment card information to pay for the Services through Our payment platform, We do not receive this information itself. Payment card information is transmitted directly to third-party payment processors through an Internet connection secured by SSL technology. The third party payment processor then communicates to Us whether Your payment has cleared, but does not provide payment card information to Skimble. </p>
<p>You also play a key role in keeping Your information safe and secure. Where You have chosen a password for access to certain parts of Our Services, You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask You not to share Your password with anyone. We urge You to be careful about giving out information in public areas of Our Services like message boards. The information You share in public areas may be viewed by any User of the Services.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although We do Our best to protect the information You share with Us, We cannot guarantee the security of the information You transmit through the Services. Any transmission of information is at Your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures We employ through the Services.</p>
<p><b>11. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>It is Our policy to post any changes We make to Our Policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on Our Website home page. If We make material changes to how We treat Our Users’ information, We will notify You by email to the email address specified in Your account or through a notice on the Site home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring We have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for You, and for periodically visiting Our Site and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>
