In consideration for your use of the Services, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Company any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on Net Income held in such pooled account. In addition to or instead of earning interest on such pooled account, Company may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged for banking services by the banks that hold your Net Income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(e) Eligible TuneCore account owners can direct a portion of their income to other eligible TuneCore accounts (referred to herein as \u0026ldquo;Split Collaborator(s)\u0026rdquo;) using the \u0026ldquo;TuneCore Splits\u0026rdquo; feature, as set forth herein. In order to create a split payment for a Recording, you will need to (i) distribute the Recording using a \u0026ldquo;Rising Artist\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Breakout Artist\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Professional\u0026rdquo; plan (Recordings distributed under a New Artist Plan are not eligible for split payments); and (ii) provide Company with the email address associated with each Split Collaborator\u0026rsquo;s account and the percentage of revenue that each Split Collaborator will receive.

Once a split has been created, in order to receive their share of revenue, each Split Collaborator must confirm the details of their revenue split. In the event that a revenue split is directed to an ineligible TuneCore account or email address, is not confirmed by a Split Collaborator, or is otherwise invalid, the portion of the revenue attributed to that payee will continue to be paid to the TuneCore account owner who created the split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(f) Sales via certain Consumer Stores, services and/or other revenue sources may not be eligible for split payments.

In such cases, your payment includes a publishing portion that covers both the mechanical and public performance royalties. If you do not own or control the underlying composition(s) in your sound recording(s), it is your obligation to pay these publishing royalties to the person or entity that does. Outside of the United States, Company customarily requires Consumer Stores to secure and pay for music publishing licenses (and such license fees may or may not be deducted by the Consumer Store concerned from the proceeds payable to Company). If any Consumer Store outside of the United States does not agree to secure and pay for music publishing licenses, Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to either (i) decline to license such Consumer Store or (ii) assume the responsibility to clear and pay for the music publishing licenses required in connection with such Consumer Store\u0026rsquo;s Sales, which license fees Company shall have the right to deduct from amounts payable to you hereunder. To the extent that Company is required or elects, in its sole discretion, to pay any of the foregoing amounts, such payments will be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable to you hereunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(c) To the extent that you select certain Recordings from your TuneCore catalog to distribute free to fans or directly through your own website, you agree that you will be solely responsible for any of the above referenced third party payment obligations resulting from such deliveries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.
