				<p>iSideWith.com reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, amend or modify these Terms and the policies relating to the Services at any time.  You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms and shall be deemed to have been notified of these changes upon the posting an updated version of these Terms on the Site.  Your continued use of the Services after any changes shall constitute your acceptance of such.</p>
				<h3>11. Notices</h3>
				<p>All notices, requests or other communications required to be given under these Terms must be in writing.  iSideWith.com may give notice by means of a general notice on the Site.

				<p>A general notice on iSideWith.com shall be deemed to have been served the next time you use the Services. </p>
				<h3>12. Arbitration</h3>
				<p>You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services (including our Privacy Policy) will be completely and finally settled on an individual basis through binding arbitration, to be conducted in Los Angeles, California (or at such other location as the parties may agree) under the commercial arbitration rules (then prevailing) of the American Arbitration Association, by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with those rules.  The arbitrator will apply the law specified in Section 14 to the merits of any dispute or claim.  The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator may grant permanent injunctions or other relief in such dispute or claim; provided that the arbitrator may not grant licenses to any intellectual property owned by either party nor may the arbitrator award punitive damages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, without breach of this arbitration provision either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to collect amounts due, for temporary injunctive relief, or to enforce such party's intellectual property rights.</p>
				<h3>13. Attorney’s Fees</h3>
				<p>In the event either party brings a claim arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services in a venue or manner other than that set forth in Section 12, and an order is entered dismissing that claim or transferring it to arbitration, the party requesting that order shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection with having such claim dismissed or transferred, or in defending the validity or enforceability of Section 12 or this Section 13, from the party bringing the claim.</p>
				<h3>14. Choice of Law; Severability; Waiver; Entire Agreement; Assignment</h3>
				<p>These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without application of the conflict of law principles thereof. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms shall not be affected or impaired thereby. No waiver by either party of the breach of these Terms will be valid or binding unless made in writing and signed by the party prejudiced thereby. These Terms constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements concerning such subject matter. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, your rights hereunder without iSideWith.com’s prior written consent.  iSideWith.com may transfer its rights, responsibilities or liabilities arising hereunder or relating to the Services at any time. </p>
