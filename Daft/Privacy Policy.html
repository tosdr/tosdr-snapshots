<h2>What are cookies and how are they used?</h2>

<p>
    A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your device's web browser by a website and is stored on your *device's hard drive.

<h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
<p>Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting, hence the name third-party. They are typically used for cross-site tracking, retargeting and the personalised advertising.</p>
