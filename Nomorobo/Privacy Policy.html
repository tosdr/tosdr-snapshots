                    <p>As defined in the CCPA, &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; mean selling, renting, releasing,
                        disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in
                        writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a
                        third party for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of
                        benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>
                    <p>We <strong>do not </strong> sell and have not sold in the last twelve (12) months any personal
                        information.</p>

                    <h3>Share of Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>We may share Your personal information identified in the above categories with the following
                        categories of third parties:</p>

                    <h3>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h3>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our
                        Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party
                        websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal
                        guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never
                        provide information on other websites without their permission.</p>
                    <p>We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of
                        age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the &quot;right to opt-in&quot;) from either
                        the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less
                        than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of
                        future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized
                        representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.</p>
                    <p>If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with
                        personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that
                        information.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Subscriptions</h2>

                    <h3>Subscription period</h3>
                    <p>The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be
                        billed in
                        advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually),
                        depending on the
                        type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription. At the end of each
                        period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You
                        cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>


                    <h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>
                    <p>You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by
                        contacting the Company.
                        You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription period
                        and You will be
                        able to access the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.</p>


                    <h3>Billing</h3>
                    <p>You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
                        address, state,
                        zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. Should automatic billing
                        fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating
                        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
                        corresponding to the
                        billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>


                    <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
                    <p>The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any
                        Subscription fee
                        change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. The Company
                        will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an
                        opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued
                        use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your
                        agreement
                        to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>


                    <h3>Refunds</h3>
                    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. Certain refund requests
                        for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at
                        the sole discretion of the Company.</p>


                    <h3>Free Trial</h3>
                    <p>The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited
                        period of time. You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for
                        the Free Trial.</p>
                    <p>If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be
                        charged by the Company

                    <p>This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by You or the Company. The Company may, in
                        its sole

                        and defects

                        on its own
                        behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
                        providers, expressly
                        disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
                        Service,
                        including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
                        non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance,
                        usage or trade
                        practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking,
                        and makes no
                        representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
                        results, be

                        interruption,
                        meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can
                        or will be
                        corrected.</p>
                    <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                        representation or
                        warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
                        Service, or the
                        information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
                        uninterrupted or
                        error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content
                        provided through
                        the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on
                        behalf of the
                        Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful
                        components.</p>
                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
                        applicable
                        statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not
                        apply to You. But
                        in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                        greatest extent
                        enforceable under applicable law.</p>


                    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of
                        its suppliers
                        under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
                        limited to the
                        amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
                        through the
                        Service.</p>
                    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers
                        be liable for
                        any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
                        limited to, damages
                        for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
                        injury, loss of
                        privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
                        third-party software
                        and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision
                        of this Terms),
                        even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even
                        if the remedy
                        fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                    <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
                        incidental or
                        consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
                        states, each
                        party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
                    <p>You expressly understand and agree that the Application Store, its subsidiaries and affiliates,
                        and its licensors
                        shall not be liable to You under any theory of liability for any direct, indirect, incidental,
                        special
                        consequential or exemplary damages that may be incurred by You, including any loss of data,
                        whether or not the
                        Application Store or its representatives have been advised of or should have been aware of the
                        possibility of
                        any such losses arising.</p>

                        at any time
                        thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
