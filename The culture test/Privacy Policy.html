    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'personally 
identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is 
information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person,

how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with 
our website. </p>

When do we collect information?
We collect information from you when you respond to a survey, fill out a form answering test questions or enter 
information on our site. </p>

<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
<p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, answer a survey, surf 
the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways: </p>

  </ul>

<h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3>
<p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. 
We use an SSL certificate. 
We implement security measures when a user places an order and/or enters, submits, or accesses their 
information. We use a payment gateway provider. </p>

<h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>
<p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes 
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn 
off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little 
different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you disable 
cookies off, some features will be disabled that make your site experience more efficient and some of our 
services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders. </p>

<h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3>
<p>We may transfer your non-identifiable information to third parties. We may also transfer your identifiable 
information, but only to trusted third parties with a direct affiliation. Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These 
third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability 
for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and
welcome any feedback about these sites. </p>

<h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy 
Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer 
protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services 
must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. 
We do not specifically market to children under 13. </p>

<h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the 
concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the 
globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to 
comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. 
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action - should a data 
breach occur we will notify the users via email within 14 business days. 
We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires 
not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. </p>

<h3>Research Use of Inputted Data</h3>
<p>By answering questions, you agree the information and data you input can be used for social and cultural 
research and referenced in published articles or books in the future. The data will always be presented in a 
generic and anonymous manner. </p>
