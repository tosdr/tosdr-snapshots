However, we do allow certain third-party partners and providers to collect information about consumers directly through our Services for purposes of providing, analyzing and optimizing our Services and advertisements (ads), providing content and ads that are more relevant, measuring statistics and the success of ad campaigns, and detecting and reporting fraud. To the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a “sale” under the CA Privacy Laws, please see our Cookie Policy for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising.\n\n#### **Rights and choices for California Residents.**\n\nAs a California resident, you may have privacy rights in addition to those described in “**Your choices**”, and we list your rights below.

If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CA Privacy Laws rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity, and provide us with confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.","spans":[]}]},"items":[{}],"id":"markdown_text$197009fd-9089-49f3-907c-ecececac112e","slice_type":"markdown_text","slice_label":null}],"seo_title":null,"seo_description":null},"meta":{"type":"Site
