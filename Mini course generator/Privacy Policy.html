Introduction</h4><p>The processing of personal data as a result of the provision of the Services shall be subject to the provisions included in the Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") indicated below, which list the obligations to which we are subject to in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 679/2016, “GDPR”), subject to the clarifications below:</p><p>• Should you or the processing of data you are carrying out be subject to the GDPR, sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.9, 9.(a), 9.(b) and 9.(d) of the SCCs shall apply to us as a way to provide for the mandatory contents set forth by Article 28 of the GDPR, subject to the clarifications included in the bullets below. Additionally, we will be informing you in the event that any instruction you deliver to us contradicts the GDPR or a privacy law approved by an EU Member State.</p><p>If you (or the data processing you are contemplating) are not subject to the GDPR, we will fully apply the SCCs as a way to ensure strengthened security measures to protect data. In this regard, you, as our customer, shall be considered the ‘data controller’ or the ‘data exporter’ and we, as the entity that collects and processes data on your behalf, the ‘data processor’ or the ‘data importer’ —as these terms are further defined under the SCCs and in the GDPR;</p><p>• For purposes of Section 8.1 of the SCCs, you agree that you shall, in the event that the instructions are given verbally, confirm them in writing (email suffices). You further convene that any requests placed through the Services (i.e. by using the interface part of the software provided with the Services and the features made available through it) shall be considered an ‘instruction’ for purposes of this Section 8.1;</p><p>• You are advised that deletion of Account shall always result in deletion of personal data, and its request to delete the Account shall be understood as a request to delete data under Section 8.5 and 16 of the SCCs;</p><p>• Company shall be entitled to charge you with a reasonable fee covering the administrative costs and expenses actually faced by us for the performance of its collaboration duties under Section 8.6.(d) of the SCCs;</p><p>• You agree that the obligation to provide information demonstrating compliance with Section 8.9 of the SCCs may be satisfied by Company making available to you copies of the audit reports and/or certifications undergone by Company, such as ISO27001 or SOC2 certificates. In the event that these documents do not reasonably address your concerns, you agree that you may only conduct up to one (1) audit per year, except that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Company is not performing the obligations laid down in this document. Audits shall only be carried out during normal business hours, and you shall bear all costs except that Company is found to be in a material breach of this document;</p><p>• Subject to the obligations set forth in the SCCs, you hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Company as your agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act on its behalf to execute any agreements with subprocessors that are engaged by Company following the provisions of the SCCs, and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further such purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by you; and</p><p>• This Data Processing Agreements forms part of the STC entered into between you and us and, subject to its section 14, is incorporated therein by reference.<br/></p><h4>2.

This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.</p><p>(b) These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><p>Clause 3</p><p>Third-party beneficiaries</p><p>(a) Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:</p><p>(i) Clause 1, Clause 2, Clause 3, Clause 6, Clause 7.</p><p>(ii) Clause 8 – Clause 8.1(b), 8.9(a), (c), (d) and (e);</p><p>(iii) Clause 9 – Clause 9(a), (c), (d) and (e);</p><p>(iv) Clause 12 –Clause 12(a), (d) and (f);(v) Clause 13;</p><p>(vi) Clause 15.1(c), (d) and (e);</p><p>(vii) Clause 16(e);</p><p>(viii) Clause 18 – Clause 18(a) and (b);</p><p>(b) Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><p>Clause 4</p><p>Interpretation</p><p>(a) Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that Regulation.</p><p>(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><p>(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><p>Clause 5</p><p>Hierarchy</p><p>In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between the Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail.</p><p>Clause 6</p><p>Description of the transfer(s)</p><p>The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.</p><p>Clause 7</p><p>Docking clause</p><p>(a) An entity that is not a Party to these Clauses may, with the agreement of the Parties, accede to these Clauses at any time, either as a data exporter or as a data importer, by completing the Appendix and signing Annex I.A.(b) Once it has completed the Appendix and signed Annex I.A, the acceding entity shall become a Party to these Clauses and have the rights and obligations of a data exporter or data importer in accordance with its designation in Annex I.A.(c) The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.</p><p>SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES<br/></p><p>Clause 8</p><p>Data protection safeguards</p><p>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.</p><p>8.1 Instructions<br/></p><p>(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.</p><p>(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.2 Purpose limitation</span><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.3 Transparency</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.4 Accuracy</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.6 Security of processing</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.7 Sensitive data</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.8 Onward transfers</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">8.9 Documentation and compliance</span><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of noncompliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Clause 9</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Use of sub-processors</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(a) The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorization for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 15 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8.

This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements: (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred; (ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards; (iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.
