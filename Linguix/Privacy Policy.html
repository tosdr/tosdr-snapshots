<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tl-dr-a-note-from-linguix-co-founder">TL;DR – a note from Linguix co-founder</h3>
<p>Hi All, this is Alex Lashkov, Linguix.com co-founder (you can see me <a href="https://linguix.com/page/team">here</a>).</p>
<p>Before you dive into this Privacy Policy, I'd like to post a quick TLDR, so that you could get an idea of what data we collect and why we do this. Here are the most important points:</p>
<div class="wp-block-group"></p>
<p><strong>Textly Inc. does not sell your personal data or your content</strong> (created on Linguix.com, Turbo.linguix.com websites). You are the only owner of your content. Our users edit their novels, prepare work-related and personal projects. We do not want to lose their (yours!) trust. Our goal is to help with your writing. Period.</p>
<p><strong>We do not store your content and texts you type when using our browser extensions</strong> <strong>or Linguix API</strong>. Data is sent to our servers to get checked, and vanishes forever with no option to restore it even for us. You can prevent Linguix Browser Extensions from accessing text areas at specific sites (eg. if you do not want us to check your emails, then you can disable the extension in Gmail).</p>
<p>However, <strong>if you choose to store your documents in our web application (app.linguix.com), these texts will remain on our servers until you delete them</strong>. Or you can use a Secret Mode in our web app, in such cases the texts will be deleted immediately after you leave the editor. </p>
<p>Our main rule: <strong>employees do not have access to your content and transmitted data</strong>. However, the content may be accessed by a dedicated employee if we need to do so in respond to your request for support, if we get an official order from authorities (subject to review, no such cases so far), etc.</p>
<p>Linguix is a freemium service, which means there are free and paid parts of the product. We hope people will buy our Premium as that's the only way we make money. So, <strong>we will tell you about pros of using our Premium offering</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We use cookies</strong> to provide better service, promote our products, and secure our users.</p>
<p><strong>A few trusted third parties</strong> under certain circumstances <strong>can help us to provide a better service</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Users can exercise their GDPR and CCPA rights.</strong> We are open to any requests from our users (i.e. deleting accounts, personal information), as well as</p>
<p></div>
<p>If there are still questions or confusing moments, feel free to drop us a message at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#187071587471767f6d7160367b7775"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="365e5f765a5f5851435f4e1855595b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, and we will get back to you shortly!
