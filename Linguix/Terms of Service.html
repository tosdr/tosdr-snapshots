The Linguix Privacy Policy is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>
<h2>Linguix Service Overview</h2>

<h2>Data collection and privacy</h2>
<p>Linguix does not collect personally identifiable information from you except to the extent you have explicitly given such right to Linguix. Linguix's information practices are further described in its privacy policy, which is available at: <a href="https://linguix.com/page/privacy-policy/">linguix.com/page/privacy-policy</a> (the “Privacy Policy”).

<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>You agree that your use of the Services is subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference into, and forms an integral part of, the Terms of Use. By agreeing to the Terms of Use or by using the Services, you expressly consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information, including your Personal Information, according to the Privacy Policy. You represent and warrant to Linguix that you are at least 18 years of age and that you have the full, unrestricted right and authority and have been fully authorized to provide to Linguix any and all Registration Data (including any Personal Information) for the purposes of these Terms of Use and that Linguix is authorized and permitted to use such data as and to the extent provided in these Terms of Use.</p>

You may opt not to receive email correspondence, other than technical notifications and email regarding issues related to your account and your use of the Site and Services, at any time by following the link included in the email messages.</p>
<h2>General Payment Terms</h2>
<p>You authorize Linguix to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Linguix, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Linguix may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>
<p>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Linguix to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our Pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing your account settings at: https://app.linguix.com/premium or by contacting us at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c7afae87abaea9a0b2aebfe9a4a8aa">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all representations, warranties and conditions relating to our website and the use of this website (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law in respect of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill). Nothing in this disclaimer will:</p>
<ul>
<li>limit or exclude our or your liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence;</li>

in relation to the subject matter of this disclaimer, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.</p>
<p>To the extent that the website and the information and services on the website are provided free of charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.</p>
<h2 id="subscription">Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Linguix to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our Premium page.</p>
<p class="tdfocus-1678727389598">Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service via Subscription tab in your settings at linguix.com. Cancellation requests via email are not considered valid because we cannot guarantee your email will be processed before the renewal or it goes to the spam folder.</p>
<p class="tdfocus-1677866970309">We do not provide refunds when you cancel your subscription or when it renews and you do not need the product anymore. After you cancel, you just will not be charged in future. Getting a PRO subscription for Linguix writing assistant does not grant a PRO access to our Linguix Turbo product, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="tdfocus-1678727408806">Linguix PRO subscriptions are non-refundable, and Linguix will not prorate any fees paid for a subscription that is terminated before the end of its term.</p>
<p>Refunds are not available for free trial subscriptions once the trial period is over and it has been converted to a paid subscription.</p>
<p class="tdfocus-1678727424080">From time to time, we provide discounts offers. For non-lifetime subscriptions, these offers apply for the first specified billing period i.e. for the monthly subscription the discount will be applied to the first month, and afterwards you will be charged a full price. Lifetime plan discounts are final as those are one-time payment plans.</p>
<p class="tdfocus-1677866947663">Converted trials, subscriptions sold with a discount during promotional campaigns, payments for Team/Business plan trial accounts, Linguix Turbo products, and one-time payments for plagiarism check credits and account upgrades are final and non-refundable.</p>
<h2>Modification of these Terms</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Modifications will become effective upon the earlier of (a) your acceptance of the modified Terms, (b) your use of the Service with actual knowledge of the modified Terms, or (c) thirty (30) days following our publication of the modified Terms through the Service.</p>
<h2>Arbitration notice</h2>
<p>Except for certain kinds of disputes described in "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration" Section, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and by accepting these terms, you and Linguix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding You agree to give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.</p>
<p>Any arbitration between you and Linguix will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Linguix’s address for Notice is: Linguix Inc., 201 180th drive , #314 Sunny Isles Bch, FL - 33160.</p>
<p>The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Linguix may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<h2>General Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Linguix regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
