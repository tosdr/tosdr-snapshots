    <p>
        <strong>For Indian Seller on Freelancer only:</strong> As of 1st of October 2018 Indian GST laws mandate a collection of 1% GST by

        government exchequer in accordance with applicable GST laws. In cases where (i) the Seller is outside India and (ii) GST is payable by the

    <p id="LimitsAndFraudPrevention"><h2>18. Limits & Fraud Prevention</h2></p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.</p>
    <p>If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those funds.</p>
    <p>We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;</li>
        <li>we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;</li>
        <li>we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or</li>
        <li>we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favour, we may remove the funds from your Account. We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances where we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behaviour, while we investigate any such matter.</p>

    <p id="Refunds">
    <h2>
    19. Refunds
    </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates to a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25 or relates to fees or charges payable to us.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to: (1) a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, the Dispute Resolution Process may be followed; or (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
    If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can request a refund by using our customer support website or emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@freelancer.com">support@freelancer.com</a>. Once you have made a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, you expressly agree to use the dispute resolution process in this agreement, expressly agree to be bound by its ruling and expressly agree not to initiate any chargeback request with your card issuer.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you initiate any chargeback request or other "Request for Information" or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
    If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.

    Subject to Section 25, we do not operate an escrow service in relation to the Website. Freelancer separately owns and operates a business known as Escrow.com - for the avoidance of doubt this business is separate and there is no connection between terms, conditions, products and services offered on Freelancer and services offered on Escrow.com. We do however, provide a service on this Website which allows controlled payments to be made with respect to a service, called Milestone Payments.
    </p>

    <p>
    Subject to the User Contract, the Buyer can make a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, which will be locked from the Buyer's Account and cannot be claimed by the Seller until:
    <ol>
    <li>the Buyer and Seller agree that the funds can be claimed by the Seller;</li>
    <li>if there is a dispute, the Buyer and Seller have concluded the Dispute Resolution Process and the Dispute is resolved in the Seller's favour;</li>
    <li>the Buyer instructs us to pay a Seller for services performed by the Seller in respect of a Project or Contest; or</li>
    <li>the Buyer acknowledges that the Seller has completed the services fully and satisfactory.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    If a Buyer does not approve of the Seller's work product, the parties may elect to resolve the issue under the Dispute Resolution Process.

    If we have not received any instructions or dispute from a Buyer or Seller in respect of a Milestone Payment within six months or any other reasonable length of time after the day that the Milestone Payment was paid and the Buyer has not logged into their Account during that time, the Milestone Payment will be unlocked and released back to the Buyer.

    <p id="RequirementsForCalifornianUsersAndMilestonePayments">
    <h2>
    25. Requirements for Californian Users and Milestone Payments
    </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    In the state of California, United States of America, Milestone Payments are regarded as regulated escrow activity.
    </p>

    <p>
    This Section deals with and applies to Milestone Payments that are connected to California, i.e. where a User, being a Buyer or a Seller, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of America (“California User” or “California Users”).
    </p>

    <p>
    So that we can continue to serve our California Users, Escrow.com (a business owned and separately operated by Freelancer) will facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Buyer and/or Seller either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in relation to any Project.  Until further notice, there will be no additional Fees for facilitating an escrow transaction initiated as a result of this Section.
    </p>

    <p>
    Where a California User is a Buyer or Seller in relation to any Project, and a Buyer seeks to initiate a Milestone Payment, the Users will be directed to complete Milestone Payments through Escrow.com as a Transaction (‘California Transaction”) in accordance with the Escrow.com Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Escrow.com Group includes Escrow.com Inc. and Internet Escrow Services, Inc (“IES”) which are owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary in the Freelancer Group.  IES is a licensed Escrow Agent in the state of California holding Escrow Agent License No. 9631867, issued by the California Department of Business Oversight. As part of using the Escrow.com service you authorise Freelancer to share your information with the Escrow.com Group to complete Escrow.com’s identity verification and know your customer procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
    On completion of the work related to the Milestone Payment, the Seller will direct IES to disburse the proceeds of the Escrow.com Transaction to the User’s Account with Freelancer.
    </p>

    <h3>Accepted Currencies for Milestone Payments and California Users</h3>

    <p>
    Escrow.com currently supports Transactions in three currencies; U.S. Dollars, Euros and Australian Dollars (“Supported Currencies”). If a Buyer's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than the supported currencies, a currency conversion will be required for the Milestone Payment to be made and an Escrow.com Transaction to proceed.  We will display foreign currency conversion rates that Freelancer, Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to one of the Supported Currencies.
    </p>

    <p>
    These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Wholesale currency conversion rates at which Freelancer or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Each User, in its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to one of the supported currencies at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in one of the Supported Currencies and either Freelancer, Escrow, or our Affiliates does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider. The User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved. The User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk. Freelancer, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than one of the Supported Currencies. Freelancer, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.
    </p>

    <h3>Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow</h3>

    <p>
    Buyers and Sellers in a California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to release applicable portions of the Milestone Payment in an Escrow Account (each portion, a “Release”) to their Seller Escrow Account or in the event of a refund, the Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service. The amount of any Release will be delivered to the applicable Freelancer Account in accordance with Seller’s or Buyer’s authorization, as above, these Instructions, and the IES Terms of Service and General Escrow Instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
    As used in these Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the following:
    <ol>
    <li>Buyer clicks to release funds to Seller.</li>
    <li>Buyer does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a Seller’s Release request, in which case Seller and Buyer agree that IES is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Seller the amount associated in the applicable milestone in connection with such Release request.</li>
    <li>Seller cancels the contract before a Milestone Payment has been released to Seller, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>
    <li>Buyer and Seller have submitted joint written instructions for a Release to either Seller Escrow Account or Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable.</li>
    <li>Buyer and Seller agree to close the contract without release of funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>
    <li>Buyer or Seller has failed to make its Arbitration payment or paid its fair share of the Arbitration costs pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.</li>
    <li>Both Buyer and Seller have failed to timely submit to Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute as such term is defined in the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Buyer.</li>
    <li>Buyer or Seller has failed timely to respond to a Freelancer Dispute Resolution Service notification as required by the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the User that has participated.</li>
    <li>Buyer or Seller otherwise has failed to comply with the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are to be released to the User that has complied with the Dispute Resolution Service.</li>
    <li>Submittal of a final award of an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such award.</li>
    <li>Issuance of the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which appeal is not taken, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such order.</li>
    <li>Freelancer believes, in our sole discretion, that fraud, non-payment, illegal act, or a violation of Freelancer’s <a href="/about/terms">User Agreement</a> has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Buyer and Seller irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to take such actions as Freelancer deems appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.</li>
