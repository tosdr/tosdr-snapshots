<p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute as a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service and the Service contemplated hereunder are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with urlscan’s prior written consent. urlscan may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. </p>

<p>If you are a business user, these Terms and Conditions, their subject matter and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by German Law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Germany. The German courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, the Service although we retain the right to bring proceedings against you for breach of the Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country.</p>
