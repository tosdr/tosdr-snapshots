<p>Your data is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.</p>
