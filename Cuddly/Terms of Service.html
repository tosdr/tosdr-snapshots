"Reviews" consist of opinions and information left by other users about Vendors. Reviews may include initial reviews from a user and responses from a Vendor. As our website is a neutral venue, we cannot, do not, and will not make any comments on behalf of any user. We do not make judgments on the veracity of opinions or statements. We may, but are not required to, take certain steps to ensure the Review is accurate, including proof that a user conducted business (or attempted to conduct business) with a Vendor. In order to protect the integrity of the Reviews, we will only consider removing a Review: (i) that contains profane, vulgar, discriminatory or adult material: (ii) for which we are provided with a binding ruling or settlement agreement from a valid and certified dispute resolution service, or is provided with a court order finding that the Review is slanderous, libelous, defamatory or otherwise illegal or the court order requires removal; (iii) that makes any reference to actions taken or purported to be taken by CUDDLY or any law enforcement organization; (iv) that violates these Terms; (v) from a user that cannot be verified by use; or (vi) if required by law. Vendors may contact us to initiate a dispute over a Review. As a Vendor, you agree that you will not: (a) attempt to restrict in any way a user's right to post a review, by contract or otherwise; (b) offer a user cash or other compensation in any form in exchange for a more favorable review; (c) post and/or cut and paste and/or copy the content of a review from the website to your own personal or business site, to any other third party website and/or to or on any of your own personal, business or third-party marketing/advertising materials, regardless of the form; (d) attempt to gain Reviews by receiving multiple Reviews from the same user; (e) post or attempt to post, in any manner or by any means, a Review on your own account; or (f) misrepresent or impersonate another user. You, as Vendor, agree and acknowledge that CUDDLY shall be entitled to retain all Reviews associated with you (including any of your responses) as well as basic directory information about you (e.g., business name, address and telephone number). Reviews about you will not be Your Content or your personal information.

Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to, doing any of the following: refusing to provide goods or services to, or accept goods or services from, a member of any Protected Class on the basis of a Protected Characteristic; submitting discriminatory content on the Website; imposing any different terms or conditions upon a member of any Protected Class on the basis of a Protected Characteristic; or any other conduct that improperly takes into account any Protected Characteristic. CUDDLY will take steps, in its sole discretion, to enforce this policy, up to and including the suspension from the Website of anyone who violates this policy. In addition, Vendors should make every effort to be welcoming to pet parents of all backgrounds. Vendors who, in CUDDLY's belief, demonstrate a pattern of refusing to provide goods or services to pet parents who are members of a protected class (even while articulating legitimate reasons) undermine the strength of our community and may be suspended in CUDDLY's sole discretion. If you experience discrimination from any pet parent, rescue, guest, Vendor, CUDDLY employee, licensor, visitor, or user of the Website, please contact support@CUDDLY.com, with the subject "Non-Discrimination Policy", so we can investigate and take appropriate measures.</span></div><div class="cdly-faq-question">&nbsp;</div><div class="cdly-faq-question">DISCLAIMER</div><div class="cdly-faq-question"><span style="font-weight: normal;">EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS OF USE, OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CUDDLY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR WARRANTIES AND OFFERS NO OTHER CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING ANY INFORMATION, DATA, OR DATA PROCESSING SERVICES RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AS WELL AS WARRANTIES IMPLIED FROM A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR COURSE OF DEALING.</span></div><div class="cdly-faq-question">&nbsp;</div><div class="cdly-faq-question"><span style="font-weight: normal;">YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
