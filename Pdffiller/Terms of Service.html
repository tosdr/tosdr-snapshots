    <div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        These Terms of Service form the agreement (“<b>Agreement</b>”) between
        you as a user (“<b>you</b>”) and the applicable provider company listed
        on the Contracting Entity Table at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdffiller.com/en/contracting-entities.htm" target="_blank">https://www.pdffiller.com/en/contracting-entities.htm</a>&nbsp;(“<b>Provider</b>”) regarding your use of websites, software
        (including software applications, mobile applications, and APIs), and
        other services of Provider (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). If you
        are using the Services on behalf of an organization, the term "you"
        refers to such organization.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <b>IMPORTANT</b>: BY CLICKING “REGISTER,” “START TRIAL,” OR SIMILAR
        WORDING TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT, SIGNING ANY DOCUMENT THAT INCORPORATES
        THESE TERMS BY REFERENCE, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING
        THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE
        TERMS, DO NOT CLICK TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT, SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT
        INCORPORATES THESE TERMS, COMPLETE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USE THE
        SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <b>PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</b><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>
      1. SERVICES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      1.1. <b>Your Services</b>. The scope of your Services is described in your
      order form, invoice, or other mutually agreed document which details the
      business terms (such as service plan, number of users, usage volume
      limits, pricing, duration, etc.) of your order (the “<b>Subscription Terms</b>”).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.2. <b>Users</b>. You and your Authorized Users may use the Services as
      permitted by the Subscription Terms. “Authorized User” means anyone you
      authorize to access and use the Services under your account. You are
      responsible for the actions of your <b>Authorized Users</b>. If you are an
      Authorized User of an organization, you agree that (i) the organization
      owns the account, including its content, and may at any time access, use,
      control, and disable your account and its content; (ii) the organization
      will have access to your data contained in the Services; and (iii) if the
      organization owns two or more accounts, it may transfer Authorized Users
      between its accounts without notice. If you use an email address procured
      for you by your organization (such as work email) to create your Services
      account, the organization owns the account. If you do not want your
      organization to access, use, or control your account, do not use an email
      address procured by your organization in connection with the Service.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.3. <b>Use by Children</b>. Our Services are not designed for or marketed
      to children under 18. If you use the Services to gather personal
      information about minors, then you are responsible for obtaining
      appropriate consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.4. <b>Account Access Credentials</b>. You are responsible for keeping
      control of your account access credentials (such as login, password,
      two-factor authentication codes, and backup codes) and for keeping it
      confidential, safe, and up to date. If you lose your credentials
      (including deleting or losing access to your email), you may not be able
      to restore access to your account and Your Content.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.5. <b>Free and Beta Services</b>. Provider may choose to make certain
      Services available to you for free, including as a trial or promotion (“<b>Free Services</b>”). Further, Provider may invite you to try new features or functionality
      not generally available to users (“<b>Beta Services</b>”). Free Services
      and Beta Services are for evaluation purposes only. Provider may
      discontinue Free Services and Beta Services at any time and may never make
      Beta Services generally available.
      <b>FREE SERVICES AND BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY
        SERVICE LEVEL OR SUPPORT COMMITMENT.</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.6. <b>Third-Party Services</b>. Optional third-party services available
      through the Services (“<b>Third-Party Services</b>”) may be governed by
      separate terms and conditions. Warranties for Third-Party Services are
      only available if the third-party provider makes such warranties to you.
      Otherwise, Provider is not responsible for such Third-Party Services. By
      using Third-Party Services, you authorize Provider to share your account
      data and Your Content with the third-party provider to enable you to
      access and receive the Third-Party Services. Services depend on
      third-party networks, Internet providers, and device manufacturers that
      are outside of Provider’s control. You acknowledge that Provider will not
      be responsible for performance or non-performance because of such networks
      or devices.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      1.7. <b>Changes to the Services</b>. Provider may enhance, upgrade,
      modify, discontinue, or stop supporting the Services at any time. However,
      Provider will not materially reduce or discontinue the core functionality
      of the Services except as permitted by this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2. AGREEMENT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      “<b>Agreement</b>” includes these Terms of Service, the Subscription
      Terms, and the following additional documents (to the extent applicable):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “Data Processing Addendum”, which governs the handling and transfer of
        personal data, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdffiller.com/en/dpa.htm" target="_blank">https://www.pdffiller.com/en/dpa.htm</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        “Service Level Agreement”, which governs the availability of the
        Subscription Services for Subscribers, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdffiller.com/en/sla.htm" target="_blank">https://www.pdffiller.com/en/sla.htm</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
      your access and use of the Services. It supersedes and replaces all prior
      or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral,
      regarding such subject matter and prevails over any inconsistent or
      conflicting terms contained in any documents, communications, or
      discussions. In case of a conflict or inconsistency between these Terms
      and any other document that forms the Agreement, these Terms will control
      unless another document explicitly states that it overrules these Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3. CONTENT OWNERSHIP.
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      3.1. <b>Your Content. “Your Content”</b> means your documents,
      communications, personal information, and other content you, including
      your Authorized Users, upload into or use with the Services. Between you
      and Provider, you own all rights to Your Content. You are responsible for
      ensuring that Your Content complies with the law.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      3.2. <b>Provider Content. “Provider Content”</b> means documents,
      communications, data, including aggregated and anonymized data about the
      use and performance of the Services, and other content provided by
      Provider as part of the Services or as part of Provider’s business
      operations. Between you and Provider, Provider owns all rights to Provider
      Content. Provider Content is considered Free Services unless it is
      expressly included as part of the Services in your Subscription Terms
      (such as Provider’s proprietary document templates). Provider Content does
      not become Your Content even if you subscribe to it or download it. All
      rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Provider.
      No rights are granted by implication, waiver, or estoppel.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      3.3. <b>Third-Party Content. “Third-Party Content”</b> means content owned
      by someone other than you or Provider. Third parties or Provider may post
      or refer to Third-Party Content on the Services. For example, as part of
      Free Services, the Services may include a reference, including preview or
      snippet, to a publicly available document found on a third-party website.
      Further, as part of Free Services, Provider may index and categorize such
      publicly available documents to make it easier for you to search for them.
      Such referenced or indexed content remains Third- Party Content.
      <b>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY SERVICE LEVEL
        OR SUPPORT COMMITMENT.</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      3.4. <b>Feedback</b>. If you provide an idea, suggestion, information, or
      feedback relating to the Services (“<b>Feedback</b>”), including, without
      limitation, new features or functionality, by this Agreement you assign to
      Provider all rights, including all copyright, patent, and other
      intellectual property rights in all of your Feedback to Provider. This
      includes Feedback submitted to Provider via support tickets, email, chat,
      survey, product review, or community forum. Where assignment is prohibited
      by law, you grant Provider and its affiliates an exclusive (even as to
      you), transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license
      (including the right to sublicense) to use all Feedback.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      3.5. <b>DMCA Takedown Requests</b>. If you believe that any content should
      not be available on the Services, you should report it to Provider’s
      support team. If you believe that any content on the Services infringes
      your copyright rights, please follow Provider’s DMCA Takedown Policy
      at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdffiller.com/en/dmca.htm" target="_blank">https://www.pdffiller.com/en/dmca.htm</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>
      4. CONFIDENTIALITY.
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      4.1. <b>Definition of Confidential Information</b>. All non-public
      information disclosed by a party (the “disclosing party”) to the other
      party (the “receiving party”) that the receiving party knows or reasonably
      should know is confidential to the disclosing party is “<b>Confidential Information</b>,” except for the information which: (a) becomes publicly available
      through no fault of the receiving party; (b) is known by the receiving
      party at the time of receiving such information without confidentiality
      obligations; (c) is obtained by the receiving party on a non-confidential
      basis from a third party that was not restricted from disclosing such
      information; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party
      without the use of Confidential Information.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      4.2. <b>Confidentiality Obligations</b>. The receiving party agrees to (i)
      protect Confidential Information with reasonable care and (ii) use
      Confidential Information only as necessary for purposes of this Agreement.
      Each party may disclose relevant portions of Confidential Information to
      the receiving party’s representatives, on a need-to-know basis, on
      condition that such individuals or entities are under obligations of
      confidentiality that require them to protect the Confidential Information
      to the same extent as required under this Agreement. If requested by
      Provider, you will return or destroy all copies of Provider’s Confidential
      Information in your possession or control within thirty (30) days. To
      delete your Confidential Information, you will delete your account via
      your account settings. Provider support can assist you with this process.
      If you delete your account, Provider will remove Confidential Information
      in your account per the then-current deletion policy or practice. However,
      each receiving party will not be obligated to delete any copies which are
      (a) needed to comply with a legal obligation or (b) are stored in its
      automated data backup systems. Either party may disclose Confidential
      Information in compliance with a mandatory legal request. These
      confidentiality obligations will remain in effect for the duration of the
      Agreement plus three (3) years.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      4.3. <b>Other Non-Disclosure Agreements</b>. If the parties execute
      another non-disclosure agreement, it will supplement (and not overrule)
      this Agreement and exist concurrently with it. In the event of
      inconsistency or conflict, the provision that provides the disclosing
      party with the broadest confidentiality protection will apply.
    </p>
    <h2>
      5. LICENSE.
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      5.1. <b>Your License</b>. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement,
      Provider grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as
      permitted by this Agreement) license to use the Services solely internally
      and only for your personal or internal business use. If you are licensing
      the API as part of the Services (as indicated in your Subscription Terms),
      your license also includes the right to incorporate the API into your

      8. YOU AGREE TO PAY THE FEES OWED FOR THE SERVICES.
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.1. <b>Fees for the Services</b>. You will pay Provider all fees for the
      Services in accordance with Subscription Terms without withholding,
      offset, or deduction. Except as otherwise agreed by Provider, all fees are
      non-refundable, even if you are not using the Services or have only
      briefly used the Services. Any prepaid, unused Services will expire at the
      end of your subscription period unless carryover is expressly permitted by
      the Subscription Terms. Provider may offer a refund policy available on
      the website for the specific Services for first-time users who are
      dissatisfied with the Services. Such refund policies only apply to you if
      you purchased any Services for the first time online via a self-service
      checkout process without assistance from a Provider sales representative.
      Refund policies do not apply to excess usage fees, Provider Content, and
      Third-Party Services. To request a refund per the refund policies, please
      follow the instructions in such policies or contact Provider’s support
      team.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.2. <b>Excess Usage Fees</b>. If you exceed any usage limits set in your
      Subscription Terms, we will bill you for the excess usage as described in
      the Subscription Terms. To the extent your Subscription Terms do not
      specify excess usage terms, the following provisions will apply:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 25px;">
      (i) your per unit price will be the standard list price available on the
      Services;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 25px;">
      (ii) your limit will be one hundred (100) units (for example documents or
      transactions) per licensed user per month of Services;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 25px;">
      (iii) Provider will bill you for excess usage monthly or in other
      reasonable increments; and
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 25px;">
      (iv) you are responsible for tracking your usage, and Provider is not
      obligated to notify you before you incur excess usage fees.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.3. <b>Taxes</b>. You agree to pay all taxes and similar assessments,
      including sales tax, use tax, value-added tax (VAT), and goods and
      services tax (GST), imposed by any government on your Services. If
      Provider does not collect taxes at the time of original purchase, Provider
      reserves the right to collect such taxes later using the same payment
      method with written notice explaining such charges. Provider also reserves
      the right to collect any penalties or interest imposed on your
      transactions if they are your fault (for example, if you provide us with a
      false address or tax status at the time of purchase).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.4.
      <b>Changes in Fees Will Be Effective as of Next Subscription Period</b>.
      Provider may change its fees for the Services any time, including
      introducing fees for formerly Free Services. Provider will notify you of
      such changes in writing or by posting on the Services.
      <b>Any changes in fees</b> to your Services will be effective as of your
      next subscription period and
      <b>will not impact your current subscription period</b>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.5. <b>Payment Terms</b>. If your Subscription Terms do not specify a
      different due date, your fees are due on the first day of the subscription
      period. If your Subscription Terms require Provider to invoice you, you
      agree to pay all fees within thirty (30) days of the date of Provider’s
      invoice. All fees are payable in the currency specified on your
      Subscription Terms. You agree to provide complete and accurate billing and
      contact information on Provider’s request and keep it updated for the
      duration of the Agreement. If you do not pay amounts when due, Provider
      may immediately suspend your access to Services and charge interest on the
      overdue amount until actually paid at the rate of 1.5% per month,
      calculated daily and compounded monthly, or the highest rate permitted by
      law, whichever is lower. You will reimburse Provider for all reasonable
      attorneys’ fees and costs incurred to collect past due amounts.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.6. <b>Automated Billing</b>. Before you can access Services, Provider
      may require you to provide a valid credit card or another form of payment
      acceptable to Provider. If you provide a credit card or other payment
      account which allows Provider to charge it, you agree that Provider may
      charge such payment account for all amounts due under this Agreement,
      including recurring fees. Provider may test your payment account with a
      small charge, which will be refunded to you within ten (10) business days.
      To avoid interruption of your Services, Provider may cooperate with your
      card provider to automatically update your payment account information.
      You authorize Provider and its payment processing providers to store your
      payment account information, including updates, and use it in connection
      with your use of the Services as described in your Subscription Terms.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      8.7. <b>Contact Support with Questions about Payments</b>. If you have a
      question about your payment or would like to dispute an invoice, you will
      contact Provider’s support team through the channels described on Provider
      website with details of the question or dispute, any supporting
      documentation, and your contact information within 30 days of the payment
      or receipt of the invoice. If you fail to contact Provider support before
      disputing the payment with a financial institution, Provider may use such
      failure as an argument against your dispute. You will continue to pay all
      undisputed amounts when due while the parties work diligently to promptly
      resolve the dispute. When a dispute is resolved, Provider will promptly
      credit any amount owed to you, and you will promptly pay all amounts owed
      to Provider.<br>

        Content outside the United States of America.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        In connection with these Terms and your use of the Services, you agree
        to comply with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-money laundering
        laws, statutes, and regulations, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
        of 1977 and UK Bribery Act 2010.<br><br>

      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        The Services are "commercial items" as that term is
        defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995) consisting of "commercial
        computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as
        used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept 1995) and are provided to the U.S.
        Government only as a commercial end item. All U.S. Government End User's
        rights to access and use the Services are set in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202 (June 1995).<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        All waivers of rights under this Agreement must be in writing by the
        party waiving its rights. No consent by a party to, or waiver of, a
        breach by the other party, whether express or implied, will constitute a
        consent to, waiver of, or excuse of any other, different, or subsequent
        breach by a party.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        If any part of the Agreement is found unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the rest of the Agreement will nonetheless
        continue in effect, and both parties agree that the unenforceable
        provisions will be modified so as to best accomplish the objectives of
        the Agreement within the limits of applicable law.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        Neither party may assign this Agreement or any right or obligations
        provided by it, except in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale
        of substantially all of its assets. Provider may also transfer or assign
        its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate. Any attempted
        assignment in violation of this section is void. The Agreement will be
        binding on and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
        assignees of the parties.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        Provider may use your name and logo for the limited purpose of
        identifying you as a customer, including by listing your company’s name
        and logo on Provider’s website. Neither party will otherwise refer to
        the identity of the other party in its public marketing communications
        unless the other party gave prior written consent.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">
        Both parties agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other
        communications that the other party sends to it electronically will
        satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such
        communications be in writing, provided that any communication to you is
        sent to the email address provided on your account and that any
        communication to Provider is sent to the applicable notice address
        specified in the Contracting Entity Table.
