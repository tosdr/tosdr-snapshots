class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5 mb-2">(Last Updated: March 14th, 2024)</div><p>This &quot;Terms of Use&quot; governs the use of any service or services provided to you (&quot;you&quot;) by YouMail, Inc., a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Irvine, California at 43 Corporate Park Suite 200 Irvine, California, USA (&quot;YouMail&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), whether through the YouMail website, youmail.com (the &quot;Website&quot;), telephone access, or through any mobile or other device, and whether directly or via a third party (each a &quot;Service&quot; and, collectively , the &quot;Services&quot;).</p><p>This is a legal agreement between you and the Company, so please read this Agreement and all related information referenced by this Agreement carefully before registering for and/or using any of the Services. By completing your registration, you will become a registered user of the Services (a &quot;Registered User&quot;), and by registering for and/or using the Services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Use (the &quot;Terms&quot;) and by this Agreement that includes the Terms (this &quot;Agreement&quot;).</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT REGISTER FOR OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.</h2><p>YouMail reserves the right at any time to modify the Terms or this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of Services. YouMail may notify you of any such change by sending an email message to your email address on your YouMail account or by a posting on the Website requiring your assent. Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance thereof.</p><p>You can review the current Terms at any time at:<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youmail.com/terms">https://www.youmail.com/terms</a>.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">1. PRIVACY</h2><p>Please review the YouMail Privacy Notice (<a href="https://www.youmail.com/privacy">https://www.youmail.com/privacy</a>), which also governs your use of the Services, to understand our practices. The YouMail Privacy Notice is a part of the Terms and this Agreement.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">2. Registration Restrictions and Obligations</h2><p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Services are not intended for persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, your use of the Services is prohibited.</p><p>In consideration of your use of the Services, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, incorrect or incomplete, or YouMail has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, YouMail has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).</p><p>Upon completing the registration process, you will receive a YouMail account and a password and/or PIN. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password/PIN and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under or via your account. You agree to notify YouMail immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.</p><p>Without limiting any other provision of the Terms and this Agreement, YouMail cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 2.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">3. REGISTRATION; TERMINATION</h2><p>To subscribe (opt-in) to any of the Services, you can register for a YouMail account from our Website, our mobile applications, or our mobile Website(s). YouMail accounts are based on telephone numbers and must be created with your real identity and with a telephone number owned by you. YouMail reserves the right to change account information that may be considered misleading, false, or in conflict with data from industry standard telephone number and name databases from carriers and other standard sources.</p><p>By registering for a YouMail account, you are providing your express consent to YouMail to receive informational messages and marketing messages solely related to your YouMail service until such time as you elect to opt out of receiving them and/or terminate your YouMail account. Such informational or marketing messages may be delivered to your e-mail address, through push notifications in the YouMail apps and/or web site, through voicemail messages delivered straight to the YouMail service, and through SMS messages to the phone numbers you have provided.</p><p>You may terminate your YouMail account and access to the Services by logging into the Website, clicking the link that says &quot;Close Your Account&quot;, and following the instructions.</p><p class="terms_termination-agreement__DkNTY">You agree that YouMail may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, limit your access to, or suspend, your account and access to the Services. Cause for such termination, limitation of access or suspension shall include, but not be limited to (a) breach or violation of the Terms or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, (b) a request by law enforcement or other government agency, (c) discontinuance or material modification to the Services (or any part thereof), (d) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (e) extended periods of inactivity, (f) engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities, (g) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Services, and/or (h) participation by you in any way in any legal action or claim against the Company. Further, you agree that all terminations, limitations of access and suspensions for cause may be made in YouMail&#x27;s sole discretion and that YouMail shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination, limitation, or suspension, of your account or access to the Services.</p><p>Termination, limitation, or suspension, of your account may include, at YouMail&#x27;s sole discretion, any or all of the following: (a) removal of access to all or part of the offerings within the Services, (b) deletion of your password and all related information, files and content associated with or inside your account (or any part thereof), (c) the playing of an “out of service” message to all parties who call your telephone number(s), and (d) the barring of any further use of all or part of the Services.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">4. YOUMAIL&#x27;S VOICEMAIL SERVICE</h2><p>One of the Services is the YouMail Voicemail Service. This Service provides a number of &quot;automatic extensions&quot; to traditional voicemail services, and these extensions may have an impact on you or your callers with respect to privacy matters or telephone carrier service usage and related charges. YouMail generally makes these features &quot;opt-out&quot; and generally provides settings to customize their behavior and/or turn them off, though YouMail is not responsible to provide any ability for users to customize or limit any Service.</p><p>These extensions include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>&quot;Smart Greetings&quot;, which allows customized greetings depending on who is calling you and automatically greets your callers with both your name and their name. Smart Greetings can be overridden by your selection of a greeting that you or someone else has recorded.</li><li>&quot;Auto replies&quot;, which under certain circumstances (a) provides callers a text message confirming to callers that they have left a voicemail message successfully, (b) may include a custom message, and (c) permits callers to see and modify the information shown with respect to their caller ID. You can opt-out or customize aspects of who receives auto replies from you and under what conditions.</li><li>&quot;Message sharing&quot;, which allows you to share messages by providing a URL to that message, where the voicemail can easily be played by anyone with knowledge of that provided URL. There is a YouMail privacy setting that can make your voicemails &quot;un-shareable&quot;.</li><li>&quot;Smart Blocking&quot;, which automatically plays an &quot;out of service&quot; message to phone numbers that YouMail deems to be problematic or that are on a user-created and maintained block list, and which automatically places in a spam folder messages from phone numbers deemed by YouMail to be sometimes problematic. You can use a YouMail setting to control this behavior, and you can allow list individual phone numbers to ensure that such numbers are never blocked or put into a spam folder when they call you.</li></ul><p>YouMail&#x27;s voicemail service is not static and continues to evolve over time, with new features and changes to how existing features behave. YouMail reserves the right at any time to modify, limit, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that YouMail shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, limitation, suspension or discontinuance of the Services (or any part thereof).</p><p>YouMail will use reasonable efforts to notify you of certain changes that would likely materially affect you or your callers&#x27; experience with the Services. These notifications, as well as service announcements and/or administrative messages will be sent to your email address provided to and kept on file with YouMail, and you agree that you will keep such email address accurate and up to date, and that any email notification sent to such address shall be deemed suitable notice of such changes. You also agree that a similar voice-message notice from YouMail left for you in your voicemail inbox will also be deemed suitable notice of such changes.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">5. YOUMAIL AS YOUR AGENT</h2><p>You agree that YouMail is your &quot;agent&quot; for answering and responding to calls, and fully operates on your behalf, as if YouMail were your personal secretary. YouMail therefore relies on your continuing representation that you have obtained, and that YouMail, as your agent, holds at all times, all necessary permissions to (a) answer all incoming calls to telephone numbers you forward to, or obtain from, YouMail, (b) access any and all contact information you provide, (c) take messages, (d) deliver messages to the email address you provide, and (e) send text or email messages to you and to your callers in response to any call or voicemail. Further, if you add additional phone numbers from YouMail, YouMail has permission to make outbound calls and send and receive text messages on your behalf.</p><p>You also agree that YouMail is your &quot;agent&quot; for blocking and/or otherwise answering unwanted or illegal phone calls, and that YouMail may block a call by any means, including, but not limited to, by suppressing the ring and/or ring notices on your phone, by playing an “out of service” message, or by taking messages and routing them to a spam folder. Further, you agree that (a) YouMail may decide as your agent which calls to block and how to block them while providing you mechanisms to customize YouMail&#x27;s behavior, and (b) YouMail may analyze captured audio and/or messages and associated calling and called numbers and use these data to identify and block calls made to others, as well as to share these findings and your underlying data with telephone service providers, enforcement authorities, and others for the purpose of preventing and/or prosecuting illegal or unwanted calls being made to you, other YouMail users, or any other person or entity that might be the recipient of such calls.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">6. STANDARD AND PREMIUM SERVICES; ABUSE OF THE SERVICES</h2><p>YouMail provides a rich set of features and capabilities in its standard services. YouMail does not charge for the standard Services or to become a Registered User.</p><p>YouMail also offers services and features that require explicit agreement to fees prior to the use of such service or feature (&quot;Premium Services&quot;). Examples of Premium Services include certain greetings recorded by artists and/or professional voice talent (which may have an associated fee for usage), plans that provide access to YouMail&#x27;s professional automated virtual assistant, plans that include voicemail transcription services, and other offerings that YouMail may make available as &quot;fee-based&quot; offerings. No fee payable to YouMail will ever be charged to you unless you have taken specific action to order the Premium Service in question.</p><p>The standard Services are solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Users using any of the Services for commercial purposes are required to select and pay for one or more of the Premium Services.</p><p>YouMail’s Services are designed for use by a single user and may not be used for any purpose other than as expressly identified by YouMail. Without limiting the foregoing, YouMail Services never include the right to scrape data from, or to reproduce, reconstruct or “reverse engineer”, any portion of, YouMail’s databases or derived data, or to test telephone numbers to learn if such telephone numbers are being blocked or identified as suspicious by YouMail. Any of the foregoing, and any use not expressly identified by YouMail in this Agreement or in a separate signed agreement with YouMail, is an “Abuse of the Services”. The price and availability of Premium Services are subject to change without notice, and YouMail reserves the right to limit any product sold, or prohibit a sale altogether, at any time. YouMail also reserves the right to reject or cancel orders that use a coupon code obtained in violation of any coupon restriction.</p><p>Subscriptions to any Premium Service are prepaid for the period selected (monthly, yearly, or otherwise). All subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each subscription period, and once any discount code or special offer associated for that subscription expires, renew at the current in-store price for the subscribed service.</p><p>Subscriptions to any Premium Service may be cancelled at any time, conveniently through the YouMail apps or through the YouMail website. All cancellations and downgrades are processed automatically.</p><p>All subscriptions are non-refundable, both for the initial purchase and subsequent monthly and annual renewals, except that if a specific plan offers a “risk-free guarantee” for a specific time period to the subscriber, YouMail will provide a refund upon the subscriber’s request to YouMail for such a refund within the risk-free time period if (a) this is the first order of a given Premium Service by a given individual or entity, (b) no phone number associated with such plan has been ported into or out of YouMail, and (c) the order was not made via an in-app purchase mechanism billed through an iOS or Android app store.</p><p>YouMail may, as part of various services and features, provide additional phone numbers to an individual user account, which include personalized access numbers and secondary phone numbers. Those phone numbers may be ported to an alternative carrier, however:</p><ul><li>A phone number may only be ported from YouMail while there is an active, premium YouMail subscription that includes that phone number, and no numbers may be ported during any &quot;free trial&quot; or &quot;risk-free trial&quot; period.</li><li>YouMail may charge a service fee for porting numbers from YouMail to an alternative carrier; In these cases, such &quot;port-out&quot; fees must be paid prior to completing the porting of the number.</li><li>In cases, where the phone number to be ported was obtained via YouMail, YouMail may charge you an additional fee for replacing the ported number with a substantially similar phone number.</li></ul><p>YouMail may, as part of various services and features, provide “data removal” services. Such data removal services are designed to monitor, and attempt to remove, personal data of YouMail users from the databases of various data brokers and other similar market participants. The data that YouMail may attempt to “remove” include phone numbers, names, e-mail addresses, and similar and/or related information. YouMail’s data removal services may be executed by one or more third parties, and are provided without any guarantee of success. Any fees paid by you for YouMail’s data removal services are payment for the efforts made by YouMail and/or its data removal partners as they request the removal of identified and applicable data. Any cancellation or termination of such service, for whatever reason, will result in the cancellation of existing or planned “data removal requests”, and may result in the re-introduction of personal data to databases that had previously deleted the same.</p><p>Except as prohibited by law, we may assess late charges if you do not pay on time. You must pay these late charges when we bill you for them. The late charge will be calculated and applied each month at the lesser of one percent (1%) of the unpaid amount per month or the maximum rate permitted by law. We may use a third-party to collect past-due amounts. You must pay all costs we incur to collect any past-due amounts, including reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend or cancel your Services if you fail to pay all amounts owed to YouMail in full and on time.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">7. LIMITATIONS ON USAGE</h2><p>YouMail provides the Services on a limited basis that permits reasonable usage of the Services by you.</p><p>YouMail may choose at any time to modify and/or enforce such limitations at its sole discretion. Reasonable usage may be defined as the average reasonable customer usage levels of any Service or feature, the usage limits explicitly communicated at or after the time of purchase, or YouMail&#x27;s own determined levels of usage. YouMail reserves the right to terminate any Service, change packaging and pricing, or otherwise take any action as necessary to prevent customer abuse and/or inappropriate or unauthorized use of Services, including without limitation Abuse of the Services. You acknowledge that YouMail may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, including, without limitation, the maximum number of days messages are retained, the maximum number of messages retained, the maximum number of calls made and/or answered and/or forwarded and/or texts sent or received, the maximum storage space allotted with respect to Services on your behalf, the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access YouMail, and the maximum number of minutes used by the Service on your behalf, including, but not limited to, to play greetings, record messages, make phone calls, and the like. You agree that YouMail has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or failure to store, any messages and/or other communications.</p><p>You acknowledge that YouMail has the right to delete accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time or that YouMail determines, in its sole discretion to be involved in an Abuse of the Services, as well as to remove all information associated with those accounts, such as but not limited to stored voicemails, call history, and settings. YouMail considers any account to be inactive if it does not have a record of at least one the following activities within a 90-day period: (a) a customer or application login and/or active session for that account, (b) a received voicemail or missed call, or (c) a payment to the account.</p><h2 class="terms_term-headers__jdWO5">8. POTENTIAL SERVICE-PROVIDER CHARGES; AVOIDANCE OF SUCH CHARGES</h2><p>YouMail supports AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as many other U.S. carriers (the &quot;Cellular Providers&quot;). Standard airtime, text and data charges of your cellular provider and the cellular providers of your callers may apply when interacting with the Services. It is generally possible for you to minimize or eliminate charges from your cellular provider in connection with the Services, which may relate to three areas: telephone access number access, data connectivity, and text messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Access Numbers.</strong> YouMail&#x27;s Voicemail Service provides you with a YouMail telephone access number to which your missed telephone calls are forwarded, as well as a YouMail telephone access number you can call to retrieve your messages (which number may be the same for any given user). When calls are forwarded to a YouMail telephone access number or you call to retrieve messages, normal toll and/or long distance and plan minute usage may apply. To reduce the chance of unexpected charges, we strongly recommend you have a &quot;nationwide&quot; plan that includes sufficient minutes to account for any incremental forwarding or retrieval call minutes. We also recommend retrieving messages online via YouMail’s desktop or mobile website or through our mobile apps whenever it is convenient.</li><li><strong>Data Connectivity.</strong> YouMail&#x27;s mobile apps require a data connection to our servers to operate. We recommend that you have a data plan that covers your data usage to avoid incremental charges for data use.</li><li><strong>Text Messages.</strong> YouMail provides features that can result in text messages being sent to your phone, which may result in additional Cellular Provider charges. For example, under certain circumstances, you can have YouMail send text messages to your phone when a new voicemail or missed call occurs (&quot;Text Alerts&quot;). If you use these features, we recommend that you have a text-messaging plan that includes enough text messages to avoid unexpected &quot;per text&quot; text-message charges from Text Alerts.</li></ul><p>Anyone may text &quot;STOP&quot; from any mobile phone to any phone number used by YouMail to send a text message and YouMail will not be able to send that phone any further text messages for any purpose, beyond a single confirmation text.

Except if you opt-out pursuant to the procedure below, you agree that all disputes between you and YouMail (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with YouMail, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms and/or your use of any Service, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&#x27;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and YouMail hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims court&#x27;s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor YouMail (with respect to you) will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims or events covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&#x27;s account, if YouMail is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the matter, then either YouMail or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.</p><p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor YouMail can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify YouMail in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this agreement to arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out:</p><ul class="terms_address-list__ShFZQ"><li><address>YouMail, Inc., Attn.: YouMail Arbitration Opt-out,<br/>43 Corporate Park, Suite 200, Irvine, California, USA.</address></li></ul><p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address and telephone number you use for your YouMail account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.</p><p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this arbitration section will be null and with respect to such matters. This agreement to arbitrate will survive the termination of your relationship with YouMail indefinitely.</p></div></div></div></div></div> </main><footer class=""><div class="footer-wrapper font-small
