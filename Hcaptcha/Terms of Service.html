Please note that our English language terms are authoritative.</em></p><p>Welcome to hCaptcha! Thank you for being a part of our community. All users of the &quot;Services&quot; (defined below) must agree to the following terms (the &quot;Terms of Service&quot;). Under these Terms of Service, &quot;IMI&quot;, &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; refers to Intuition Machines, Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, representatives, and agents, and our &quot;website&quot; includes any website under our control, including www.hcaptcha.com and www.imachines.com.</p><p>Please read these Terms of Service. They include, among other provisions, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and binding arbitration. Please note that these Terms of Service may have changed since your last visit to our website. We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. In the event of a material change, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms of Service on this page, after which you must affirmatively accept the updated Terms of Service in order to continue using or accessing the Site or the Service.</p><p>Please note that your use of our Service is governed by our Data Processing Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference. Please review this agreement to see how we process personal data on your behalf. Note that we operate as a &quot;data processor&quot; for purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and a &quot;service provider&quot; for the purpose of the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p><p><a href="https://newassets.hcaptcha.com/dpa/IMI_Data_Processing_Addendum_4.20.2023.pdf" rel="noopener">Data Processing Agreement (Last updated: April 21, 2023)</a></p><p>If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not use or access the Site or the Service.</p><p>1. Purpose</p><p>The Services include an online security service (the &quot;hCaptcha Service&quot;) and a platform (the &quot;Intuition Machines Platform&quot;) on which an individual (&quot;Contributor&quot;) can choose to perform tasks that a third party entity or Intuition Machines itself (each a &quot;Requester&quot;) posts to our website or the hCaptcha Service, either directly on our website or by accessing the Intuition Machines Platform and/or performing tasks through or in connection with a third party entity and/or platform or service (each, an &quot;Integrator&quot;). Requesters post tasks and invite Contributors to perform them in exchange for rewards provided by IMI to Integrators, or as determined by the Requester if the Requester is using the Intuition Machines Platform or hCaptcha Service to serve tasks to their own end-users. We charge companies and individuals (each a &quot;Customer&quot;) for use of our platform so that they may use our software, author tasks, hire us to author tasks, and/or gain access to the Contributors. We also charge Integrators for use of our hCaptcha Service in order to reduce fraud, abuse, and spam on their websites, mobile apps, and other online properties. The foregoing is referred to collectively as the &quot;Services.&quot;</p><p>2. Eligibility</p><p>By using or registering for our Services, you agree: you are at least 18 years of age; you have the authority to enter this agreement on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent, and will at all times remain in compliance with these Terms of Service and all IMI policies and guidelines referenced herein; and you will not abuse our website, misrepresent your identity to us, or use artificial intelligence to complete any portion of any task on IMI which requires human intelligence.</p><p>3. Customers and Requesters</p><p>If you are a Customer or Requester, you agree that the additional terms attached hereto as the Customer Appendix will apply and be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. If you are not a Customer or Requester, or cease to be a Customer or Requester, then the additional terms in the Customer Appendix will not apply nor will they be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. </p><p>4. Username and Password</p><p>Upon registration, you will be asked to disclose certain personal information about you (&quot;Personal Information&quot;), including your name, email address, and to create a username and password, all of which will be subject to our Privacy Policy, available on our website. You alone are responsible for monitoring, ensuring and maintaining the security of your account, passwords, and any authentication keys associated with your account, and you are responsible for any use of or action taken through use of that information on the Services. </p><p>You agree that you will not share your account or password with anyone.</p><p>You must notify IMI immediately if you suspect that your account information has been stolen or used by someone else, or any other breach of security.</p><p>You agree to provide us with true, accurate and complete information as requested in our registration process. You also agree to update such information promptly as necessary to keep it current and accurate.</p><p>5. Your Privacy, Your Data, and &quot;Data For All&quot;</p><p>You accept our Privacy Policy, which governs what we will do with any Personal Information you give to us. </p><p>In addition to Personal Information, you may also be required to provide (or it may be necessary for us to collect) other data so that we may provide the Services (collectively, &quot;Customer Data&quot;). We are not liable for any failure to perform Services that is caused by your delay or failure to provide Customer Data.</p><p>You hereby grant to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license during the term of this Agreement to use, reproduce, electronically distribute, and publicly display any Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services. You represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section. </p><p>We aggregate Customer Data with other data so that results are non-personally identifiable and we also collect de-identified technical logs and data regarding use of the Services (&quot;Aggregate/De-identified Data&quot;). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such Aggregate/De-identified Data may be used by IMI for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement, including without limitation to develop and improve the Services and to create and distribute reports and other materials. Customer Data may also persist and be displayed in the system for a limited period of time not to exceed 180 days after a job is complete, for example as automatic calibration or validation data for Intuition Machines systems. For clarity, this Section 5 does not give us the right to identify you as the source of any Aggregate/De-identified Data without your prior written permission.</p><p>‍<em>For the avoidance of doubt, the following paragraph applies exclusively to Customers using our annotation services, and not to use of our Services as an Integrator</em>. If you are a Customer of our annotation services and have selected the &quot;Data For All&quot; option as part of your use of the Services, then you grant to IMI and all users of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license to fully exploit all Customer Data, including all related intellectual property rights. If you do select the &quot;Data for All&quot; option, you represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section.</p><p>If your data contain potentially explicit or offensive content, we require you to mark them &quot;EXPLICIT CONTENT&quot; to serve as fair warning to anyone who sees your data. You may not without a separate written agreement with IMI include tasks that violate our policies, including, but not limited to, (a) tasks that directly or indirectly promote another website or service, (b) tasks that violate a third party website&#x27;s terms and conditions, (c) tasks asking Contributors to solicit third parties, (d) tasks that ask Contributors to take action to manipulate a website&#x27;s behavior or results, (e) tasks that violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, and (f) tasks that require Contributors to download software or files.</p><p>6. Acceptable Behavior</p><p>You are encouraged to interact with other users anywhere on our website, Forum, messaging, chat, and other social media channels controlled by IMI, but if you do so you must comply with all terms of service and use on our site and all relevant laws.</p><p>Please note that your access to our service requires compliance with all applicable laws. We may choose to block or remove your account and any associated resources if your service:</p><ul role="list"><li>Contains, displays, distributes, or encourages the creation of child sexual abuse material, or otherwise exploits or promotes the exploitation of minors;</li><li>Infringes on intellectual property rights;</li><li>Has been determined by appropriate legal process to be defamatory or libelous;</li><li>Engages in the unlawful distribution of controlled substances;</li><li>Facilitates human trafficking or prostitution in violation of the law;</li><li>Contains, installs, or disseminates any active malware, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system);</li><li>Is otherwise illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others, including content that discloses sensitive personal information, incites or exploits violence against people or animals, or seeks to defraud the public.</li></ul><p>7.

Contributor Dispute Resolution</p><p>If you are a Contributor, you agree to the following arbitration clause and class action waiver:</p><p>Alternative Dispute Resolution Required.</p><p>You agree that for any dispute that arises out of or relates to your use of the Services, including any dispute that may have arisen from the time that you began performing tasks for IMI, and specifically including any claim related to whether or not you classify as an independent contractor, you will first notify IMI of your claim against it. You and IMI will then attempt to resolve the issue through either direct negotiation or mediation. We will split equally the cost of mediation and agree that mediation shall be conducted through telephonic or other electronic means. If a claim remains unresolved following informal negotiations or mediation, you agree that you and IMI will use final and binding arbitration to resolve the dispute. This clause governs all claims retroactively from the time you began using our website, whether based on tort, contract, statute, including, but not limited to, any claims of discrimination and harassment, whether they be based on the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or any other state or federal law or regulation, equitable law, or otherwise.</p><p>Arbitration Procedure.</p><p>All arbitration under this agreement will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association or by a mutually agreed upon arbitration service. The arbitrator will be a U.S. arbitrator selected from a list of no less than seven (7) names through alternative strikes. In arbitration, each party will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Resolution of the dispute shall be based solely upon the law governing the claims and defenses pleaded, and the arbitrator may not invoke any basis other than such controlling law. The arbitrator shall have the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of an arbitrator, which immunity supplements any other existing immunity. Awards must include the arbitrator&#x27;s written reasoned opinion. You give up your right to trial by jury of any claim you may have against IMI or that IMI may have against you. Any claim under this clause must be brought within the applicable statute of limitations period. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs this clause, and you acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction in commerce.</p><p>Exceptions.</p><p>Disputes that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) are excluded from this</p><p>Administrative Exhaustion.</p><p>You may bring any claim arising out of your use of this website to an administrative agency but only to the extent applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the National Labor Relations Board. Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude or excuse you from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill your obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, however, you waive the right to any monetary award through this such agency proceedings.</p><p>Location of Arbitration.</p><p>Any arbitration proceeding under this section will take place by default within the State of California, unless you reside outside the United States, in which case the arbitration will take place entirely electronically or telephonically. The arbitration may take place at any other location if agreed to by every party in writing. Regardless of its location, any party may opt to appear at the arbitration via live video or teleconference.</p><p>Class Action Waiver.</p><p>You waive any right you have for any dispute to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, or representative action. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this agreement, the preceding sentence shall not be severable from this agreement in any case. Any claim that all or part of this waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. You will not be retaliated against or prevented from completing tasks on our website as a result of your exercising your rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action in any forum, but we may lawfully seek enforcement of this class action waiver, and seek dismissal of such class, collective or representative actions or claims.</p><p>Costs and Fees.</p><p>The parties shall each bear their respective costs for legal representation at any such arbitration, except to the extent that attorney&#x27;s fees are explicitly provided for by law. The parties will split any initial administrative fee charged by the arbitrator, up to a maximum cost to you of two hundred fifty dollars (US$250.00). The cost of the arbitrator and court reporter, if any, shall initially be borne by us; however, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to award appropriate costs to the prevailing party, as provided by law, and/or to require the parties to split the costs associated with the arbitrator and/or court reporter.</p><p>Severability.</p><p>Except for the Class Action Waiver, if any term or provision, or portion of this arbitration clause is declared void or unenforceable it will be severed and the remainder of the arbitration clause will be enforceable.</p><p>26.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by both parties in writing, you will provide full payment for all invoices issued within thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice.

Unless stated otherwise on the Order Form or within your Enterprise Service Agreement or Master Service Agreement, all fees for Services, aside from overages, are billed annually upon the start of services provided by IMI under your Agreement (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;).</p><p>Any late payments will accrue late charges at the rate of 1.5% percent per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is lower. If you fail to pay the amount due under this Agreement for any reason, your account may be suspended, at our sole discretion, in which case no additional payments will be made from your account for completion of tasks and all of your tasks will be removed from our website. You must reimburse us for all amounts due upon demand, plus any processing fees, late fees, or attorney fees. We may also make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities.</p><p>If you wish to dispute any fees, you must contact our customer support department no later than thirty (30) days after the closing date on the first billing or account statement in which the error or problem appeared in order to receive an adjustment or credit.</p><p>3.

API</p><p>You may be required to integrate your website, application, or platform with our Services via our application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;). In the event that you do so, we grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonassignable, revocable license to use the API solely to access the Services. We may modify the API and/or cease support of old versions or releases of the API at any time.

We will wind up our work in a commercially reasonable manner and preserve and deliver to you all paid-for Output Data Sets and all Customer Data in our possession. Upon any termination, we may but are not obliged to delete any data.</p><p>7. Overages</p><p>The maximum permitted peak RPS rate for hCaptcha Integrators or Customers is one thousand (1,000) requests per second to entities within your account (&quot;RPS&quot;), unless otherwise specified by a written contractual agreement between you and us.</p><p>The maximum number of requests per month permitted under the hCaptcha Publisher (free) tier is one million (1,000,000) for Integrators, aside from use of the hCaptcha Services in a web application firewall or DDoS protection context, in which case the maximum number of monthly requests permitted is one hundred thousand (100,000). In the event that you exceed this quota without prior written authorization from us, your account will no longer be eligible for earnings, and we may elect to terminate your service if you continue to exceed the Publisher request quota. Please note that this quota applies across all accounts used by an organization or individual: in the event that you have signed up for ten free accounts, the total permitted requests per month is shared across them.</p><p>Please note that only 100,000 requests per month are potentially eligible for earnings. Accounts that exceed this quantity of requests will no longer be eligible for earnings in that quarterly cycle. Similarly, earnings for eligible accounts do not roll over: accounts that do not reach the minimum payout threshold of 10 USD in a quarterly cycle window, do not opt in for a withdrawal during that that cycle and prior to reconciliation, or do not provide valid PayPal accounts prior to attempted transfers, will not retain those earnings points in the next cycle.</p><p>In the event that you are an Integrator or Customer of the hCaptcha Enterprise service and your API usage as measured by RPS exceeds the provisioned rate for your service tier, we may elect to modify your service or to charge an overage rate. In the event that your peak RPS rate exceeds the provisioned rate by a factor of 10 for 10 or more minutes in total within a 30 day period and the majority of these requests are, in our sole judgment, not malicious traffic, we may elect to charge you at your contractually specified overage rate for all API requests made in that month.</p><p>8. Resale</p><p>Unless expressly permitted in Customer’s Master Service Agreement or Reseller Agreement, ordered SaaS Services shall not be sold, resold, leased, sub-leased, licensed, sub-licensed, or otherwise made available to any other third party (other than an Affiliate of Customer), and all orders under the Agreement and all Customer use of the Service shall be for Customer’s or its Affiliate’s own internal business use.</p><p>9. Billing Units</p><p>If you are a Customer of the hCaptcha Service, you will be billed for evaluations (&quot;Billing Units&quot;) by a formula based upon the number of requests made to site keys associated with your account or organization. The calculated value will be accessible to you under the &quot;billing_units&quot; key in the metrics API if you are an Enterprise Customer, or on your invoice if you are a Pro Customer.</p><p>In most cases the count of Billing Units in a period will be similar or identical to the number of requests shown in your Traffic Overview dashboard, but in some cases it may be lower or higher.</p><p>For example, in the event of a high RPS attack against your site keys attempting to create a denial of service, we may elect not to charge you for Serves that are determined by us to be related to that attack. Similarly, in some cases our system may perform a second evaluation on a request or a user, which will cause as an increment in the Billing Units. This may happen in a variety of scenarios, for example if the user aborts a session after we have performed an evaluation but before data has fully loaded and client-side rendering is complete.</p><p>9. Sanctions, Embargoes, and Other Restrictions on Use<br/><br/>You acknowledge and agree that the Service and any of its data accessed by you shall not be used, transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries upon which the United States or European Union member states maintain an embargo (collectively, &quot;Embargoed Countries&quot;), or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, Denied Persons List, or Unverified List, or the U.S. Department of State’s Nonproliferation Sanctions list (collectively, &quot;Designated Nationals&quot;).

For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any Sanctioned Actors designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;) of the US Department of the Treasury.</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, we also reserve the right to remove earnings eligibility, including retroactively, or terminate accounts for residents and citizens of countries designated as high risk by us at our sole discretion.

In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.  Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and oversight bodies; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier and customer impact; regulatory reporting; and giving our customers prompt notice if we are unable to continue our business. Our core supplier pool backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by this supplier pool that their objective is to restore their own operations and be able to resume services rapidly. Although we have worked to reduce risk by using a diverse set of suppliers, your services could be modified or interrupted during this period.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Varying Disruptions </strong>– Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the neighborhood where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to our firm, our business district, city, or region or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect no material disruption to business operations. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to alternative suppliers if necessary, and notify you through our website at hcaptcha.com and our status page at hcaptchastatus.com as to how to contact us. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you expeditiously.</p><p>‍<strong>For more information</strong> – If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f784828787988583b79f94968783949f96d994989a">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br/></p></div></div></div></section><div bind="6395893a-e5fe-ad5b-d853-97b7d8379d42" role="navigation" aria-label="Footer" class="section grey-400-stroke"><div class="container padding-0topbottom"><div class="footer-nav"><div class="footer-logo"><a aria-label="homepage link" tabindex="-1" href="/labeling" class="hcaptcha-logo footer-logo w-inline-block"></a><div class="footer-social"><div id="social-tw" class="social-icon margin-right"><a aria-label="twitter" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/hcaptcha" target="_blank" class="invisible-link w-inline-block"></a><div bind="baca4d9f-97b3-ea5e-d3dc-157bfa33ac71" class="icon-facebook w-embed"><a href="https://twitter.com/hcaptcha" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="invisible-link w-inline-block" title="twitter">
