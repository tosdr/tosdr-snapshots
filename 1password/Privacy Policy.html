Policy.</p><h3 id=who-we-are-and-our-commitment-to-privacy>Who We Are and Our Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>1Password is a Canadian company located at 4711 Yonge St, 10th Floor,
Toronto, Ontario, M2N 6K8, Canada. At 1Password, we believe that the
less information we know about you, the better. After all, it is
impossible to lose, misuse, or abuse information we don&rsquo;t have. To the
extent that we have control over your data or data about you, we see
ourselves as custodians of that data on your behalf.</p><p>We use your data solely to provide you with Services in which you enroll
and to provide you an enhanced user experience when you visit our
Website. Our business is providing 1Password products and Services to
you, the customer. We have no desire or interest to use or transfer the
limited data we acquire for any other purposes.</p><h3 id=who-are-you>Who are You</h3><p>Unless otherwise noted, we refer you, the Customer, as an owner or
organizer of an individual, family, team, or business account.</p><p>If you represent an organization, such as a business or educational
institution, that utilizes 1Password products or services through
Enterprise accounts or if you are an end user of 1Password product or a
1Password account provided by your organization, please see
the <a href=https://1password.com/enterprise-password-manager/>1Password
Enterprise</a> Accounts
section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data.</p><h3 id=non-owners>Non-Owners</h3><p>If you are a non-owner member of a team, business, or family account,
your use of 1Password may be subject to your organization&rsquo;s privacy
policy or practices, if any. Non-owner members of an account transfer
some of the rights described here to the account owners.</p><h3 id=information-collected-through-the-1password-services>Information Collected Through the 1Password Services</h3><p>We collect some data from you, in order to provide you with our
1Password products and Services, in addition to your use of our Website.
You provide some data directly, such as when you create a 1Password
account, when you register for a 1Password event or a webinar, or
contact us for support. Such data is limited to your email address only.
We get some limited data from your use of the 1Password products and
services. Such data includes your IP address, and the make and model of
your device through which you access or use 1Password products or
services.</p><p>We use your personal data to provide you with services associated with
the use of 1Password account and to provide you with a rich customer
experience through our customer support. In particular, we use your data
to provide 1Password services, which includes updating, securing and
troubleshooting, and providing support.</p><p>The following is a more detailed description of the types of 1Password
account user data:</p><p>We process two kinds of user data to deliver our services: (i) Secure
Data and (ii) Service Data. Both are treated securely with respect for
customer privacy and data confidentiality, but there are important
technical and usage differences.</p><h5 id=i-secure-data>(i) Secure Data</h5><p>Secure Data are the data that we are not capable of decrypting under any
circumstance. It includes all information stored within vaults in
1Password accounts. These data are encrypted using secure cryptographic
keys that exist only in the possession and under the control of our
customers. We have no way of accessing or providing decrypted Secure
Data, and we never receive copies of unencrypted Secure Data.</p><p>Your Secure Data is your property. We claim no rights to it beyond those
necessary to deliver services to you. You may add, modify, and delete
Secure Data at your discretion. If you do not have a 1Password account,
you cannot provide us with Secure Data.</p><h5 id=ii-service-data>(ii) Service Data</h5><p>We inevitably acquire Service Data about your usage of 1Password, your
account, and your payments through operating our services. We retain
only enough Service Data to operate and maintain the services. These
data are never used for any other purpose.</p><p>Service Data are kept confidential. It is visible to our staff and
includes, but is not limited to, server logs, billing information,
client IP addresses, number of vaults and number of items in vaults,
company or family name, and email addresses. Service data includes the
name you provide us for your profile and any image that you may upload,
at your option and discretion, as part of your profile.</p><p>As long as you are using our services, we retain the right to hold and
use Service Data to provide our services, troubleshoot problems, analyze
the performance and demands on our services, and to provide our payment
processors with the information they need to process payments.</p><h5 id=iii-diagnostic-data-optional>(iii) Diagnostic Data (Optional)</h5><p>Diagnostic Data are a category of Service Data which are not
automatically collected or required for operation of our services.</p><p>In some cases we seek diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug,
and crash reports from customers to help identify and solve problems
with our products and services. This information is sent to us only on a
case by case basis, or by users who explicitly opt into our beta
software programs or who otherwise explicitly choose to provide
diagnostic data to us.</p><p>Diagnostic Data may contain sensitive information about your devices and
operating environment as well as personally identifying information.
Although there may be occasions when we ask for Diagnostic Data to
assist you with a problem, you are never obligated to provide it.</p><p>Diagnostic data never includes decrypted Secure Data. We will never ask
for your Account Password or Secret Key.</p><h3 id=keeping-your-information-safe>Keeping Your Information Safe</h3><p>We understand and accept our responsibility to protect Service Data and
Secure Data. We use strict access control mechanisms, network isolation,
and encryption to ensure that Secure and Service Data is only available
to authorized personnel. Additionally, Secure Data cannot be decrypted
even by those who do have access to it.</p><h3 id=information-collected-from-your-use-of-our-website>Information Collected from Your Use of Our Website</h3><p>In a few areas on Our Website, We ask you to provide personal
information that will enable Us to enhance your site visit, to assist
you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your
visit. It is completely optional for you to participate. For example, We
request information from you when you:</p><ul><li>Subscribe to a newsletter</li><li>Participate in promotional offers</li><li>1Password uses your information for specific purposes. Your
information may be used to:</li><li>Send you requested information about 1Password</li><li>Provide support</li><li>Market 1Password products or Services to you</li><li>Provide you with access to 1Password Services</li></ul><p>Personal information you provide will be kept confidential and used to
support your customer relationship with Our company.</p><p>All email communication with you will be on an Opt-In basis. This is
solely at your discretion. Occasionally, We will send you e-mail
communications with information, which may be useful to you, including
information about Our products and Services or about offerings from
affiliates or business partners. When you first provide Us with your
e-mail address, you will be given the option of not receiving any such
e-mail communications. We will include instructions in Our e-mail
messages on how to unsubscribe if you later decide you do not want to
receive any future e-mail communications. At any time, you can easily
opt-out of receiving further marketing from 1Password by contacting Us
at the address below and requesting to have your name removed from Our
lists.</p><h3 id=information-sharing-and-disclosure-to-third-parties>Information Sharing and Disclosure to Third Parties</h3><p>Agents or contractors of 1Password may have access to your personal
information for the purpose of performing services on behalf of
1Password. All such agents or contractors who have access to your
personal information have Data Processing and Confidentiality
obligations to keep the information confidential and not use it for any
other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for
1Password.</p><p>Unless We tell you otherwise, or unless otherwise stated in this Privacy
Policy or required by law, We do NOT sell or rent your personal
information to any third parties. However, We might share your personal
information with Our service providers, such as Our hosting services
providers. If you choose to participate in a survey, a focus group etc.,
we may also share de-identified data with Our customers.</p><p>Information collected from you is only used to complete and support your
purchases from 1Password and use of the Site and to comply with any
requirements of law. 1Password may disclose personal information if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
process served on 1Password or this Site; (2) protect and defend the
rights or property of 1Password; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to
protect the personal safety of users of 1Password, its web sites or the
public. We may collect and possibly share your information in order to
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
safety of any person, violations of Our terms and conditions posted on
Our Websites, or as otherwise required by law.</p><p>If 1Password is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent
notice on Our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your
personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your
personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to
any other third-party with your prior consent.</p><h3 id=compliance-with-the-laws>Compliance with the laws</h3><p>AgileBits fully complies with applicable data protection laws. If you
are affiliated to an organization who provides you with 1Password
account through its Enterprise level account then there may be
additional requirements for us to meet, based on the contracts with the
organization. For further information, please read below the
section <a href=https://1password.com/legal/privacy/#1password-product-or-account-provided-by-your-organization>1Password Product or Account provided by your
Organization</a>.</p><h4 id=data-location>Data Location</h4><p>1Password.eu data are held on servers located within the European Union.
Secure Data originating in the European Union remains within the
European Union.</p><h4 id=customer-support-system>Customer support system</h4><p>Our customer support and email services are hosted primarily in the
United States. Any information you choose send us through email or our
customer support system may pass through and be stored on a variety of
intermediate services. If you wish, you may encrypt email to us using
our <a href=https://1password.com/support-at-agilebits-pubkey-42F3D4D4.asc>PGP public
key</a>.</p><h4 id=third-party-data-processors>Third-Party Data Processors</h4><p>Your Secure and Service data are held by third-party data processors,
who provide us with hosting and other infrastructure services. The
locations of these are described above. In many cases (but we cannot
promise that this will always be the case) even Service data held by
these entities is encrypted with keys held only by us.</p><p>Data needed to process payments is collected by our payment processor,
Stripe, Inc., which conforms to the U.S. Data Privacy Framework
(&ldquo;EU-U.S. DPF&rdquo;), the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S.
Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
(collectively, the &ldquo;DPF&rdquo;). See
<a href=https://stripe.com/legal/data-privacy-framework>https://stripe.com/legal/data-privacy-framework</a>.</p><h3 id=contacting-you>Contacting You</h3><p>We may use your contact information, that is, the contact email address
provided by you, to communicate with you about Service activity, provide
support, and send you other information such as product updates and
announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications from us,
except certain important notifications such as billing and account
security alerts.</p><h3 id=your-responsibilities-for-protecting-your-data>Your Responsibilities for Protecting Your Data</h3><p>When you create a 1Password account you will receive a Secret Key and
will be prompted to create a Account Password. Your Secret Key is
generated on your computer and your Account Password is something you
create yourself. For your protection, you should create a strong and
unique Account Password to ensure that it is not easily guessed.</p><p>It is extremely important that you understand that anyone with both your
Secret Key and Account Password can access your Secure Data. It is
equally important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own
reference, because future access to your Secure Data depends on having
access to both your Secret Key and your Account Password. We will never
ask you for your Account Password or your full Secret Key, and you
should never send it to us or anyone.</p><p>Due to the nature of our design and the sensitivity of the information
you entrust to us (even in encrypted form), it may not be possible for
us to help you with certain customer service requests unless you are
listed as an account owner and are communicating from your verified
email address. In the event that you change your email address, it is
very important that you update your email on your 1Password account(s)
or you may eventually lose access.</p><h3 id=data-protection-principles-that-we-practice>Data Protection Principles that We Practice</h3><h4 id=i-data-portability>(i) Data Portability</h4><p>We want happy customers, not trapped ones. We will not lock you out of
your own data. However, we are unable to decrypt your Secure Data; you
will need your Account Password and Secret Key to decrypt it.</p><p>You may export your 1Password data at any time you wish during the life
of your account. If you discontinue payment, your account will enter a
frozen (read-only) state for a period not less than six months during
which you may still retrieve and export your data.</p><p>Export is limited to your Secure Data. Vault permissions, the structure
of groups of individuals, and other information about the relationship
between individuals and data is not guaranteed to be included in export.</p><h4 id=ii-your-right-to-know-to-what-we-know>(ii) Your Right to Know to What We Know</h4><p>You have the right to know what we know about you and to see how that
data is handled. You may request a screenshot of what we can see about
you in our back office systems. However, to protect customer privacy,
such requests must be carefully authenticated beyond demonstrating
control of the customer&rsquo;s email address.</p><h4 id=iii-your-right-to-have-your-data-erased>(iii) Your Right to Have Your Data Erased</h4><p>As we are merely custodians of your data, account owners have the right
to instruct us to remove data permanently from our systems. To ensure
that no one&rsquo;s data is deleted without their consent, you must first
delete your account through an authenticated session. After your account
has been deleted, the account owner may contact us and ask for the data
to be expunged. Once the request is authenticated, the data will be
removed from our active systems within 72 hours.</p><p>Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that AgileBits
has a legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups.
Backups are kept for 35 days. Erasure requests will leave those backups
untouched, and we will only remove data from backups if legally
compelled to.</p><h4 id=iv-your-right-to-access-and-control-your-personal-data>(iv) Your right to access and control your personal data</h4><p>You can control your personal data and exercise your data protection
rights by contacting AgileBits at <a href=mailto:dsar@1password.com>dsar@1password.com</a>.</p><p>In addition, you can add, remove, edit, change any data that are in
the <a href=https://1password.com/resources/guides/create-and-manage-shared-vaults/>1Password
vault</a>.
If you are an affiliate of an organization which provides you with the
access to 1Password account and services, there may be certain
restrictions to the above, based on your affiliate organization&rsquo;s
privacy or other similar policies. For further details, please review
below the section under <a href=https://1password.com/legal/privacy/#1password-product-or-account-provided-by-your-organization>1Password Product or Account provided by your
Organization</a>.</p><h3 id=chat-bots>Chat Bots</h3><p>We use chat bots or automated communication tools to facilitate your communications with us across our Services. These tools may collect and record the contents of any communications you send through them. They may also collect analytics information, such as device and usage information. We may disclose this information to our relevant service providers for the purpose of providing these tools, improving our customer support and internal marketing purposes.</p><h3 id=cookies-and-other-tracking-devices>Cookies and Other Tracking Devices</h3><p>First of all, we do not use third-party trackers in our web application (my.1password.com), or our client applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android or iOS.
