We’ve helped people in all 50 states get the legal support they need to move personal injury claims successfully through the court system. Please find our web site's <em>Terms of Use</em> below.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting one of the websites of Sokolove Law, LLC and Sokolove Law, LLP. Our websites provide information about the legal services that we offer, provide general information and resources, and allow you to contact us.</p>
<p>All references to “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firm</span></strong>,” “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we,”</span></strong> “<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span></strong>,” or “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span></strong>” refer to Sokolove Law, LLC (which operates as a limited liability company in all states except California, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia), Sokolove Law, LLP (which operates as a limited liability partnership in California, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia), and their affiliated and related entities. All references to “ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">websites</span></strong>” include Firm websites that post a link to this Terms of Use (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms</span></strong>”), including this website, our other Firm-owned and/or operated websites that post these Terms, and websites that post these Terms that are operated for the Firm by service providers under agreement with the Firm.</p>
<p><strong>Please read these Terms of Use carefully. They are legally binding terms and conditions under which you may access and use the websites. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms, do not use or access the websites.</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of our websites, including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of our websites. By using any one of our websites you accept, and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with, our <a title="Privacy Policy" href="/privacy/"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a>. By using our websites, you further agree that we may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Device (defined in Paragraph 5(C) below) in order to allow for or optimize your use of the websites.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to terminate or limit your access to the websites for any violation of these Terms, or for any other reason, at our sole discretion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Legal Notices and Disclaimers</strong></span></p>
<p>(A) <strong>No Attorney-Client Relationship is Created by Your Use of the Websites.</strong> No attorney-client relationship between you and the Firm is or may be created by your access to or use of the websites or any information contained on them. The only way to become our client is through a mutual agreement in writing. Any information you submit via the websites will not be considered confidential and may be subject to applicable disclosure and reporting requirements, as required by law. If you are interested in asking us to represent you, please call us or otherwise contact us through one of our websites so we can determine whether the matter is one for which we are willing or able to accept professional responsibility. Each website includes a submission form through which you can request that we contact you about our potentially representing you, and each website includes a phone number that you can use to contact us. In addition, please note that attorney ethical rules in certain of the states where our attorneys are licensed require that we provide certain information, so please review our <a title="Disclaimer" href="/disclaimers/"><strong>Disclaimer</strong></a> for additional information.</p>
<p>(B) <strong>If You are not a Client Pursuant to a Written Engagement Letter, do not Submit Confidential or Sensitive Information.</strong> If you submit information to us by email or otherwise through one of our websites in connection with a matter for which we do not presently represent you, you acknowledge that it will not be considered to be confidential and consent to our sharing it with other law firms to determine whether we will agree to represent you. We cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict-of-interest. Accordingly, please do not send us any information about any matter that may involve you or the matter until you and we enter into an engagement letter or other written agreement stating that we agree to represent you. You recognize that any information that you submit and our review of your information will not preclude any lawyer in our Firm from representing a party directly adverse to you, in any matter where that information is relevant, even if that information is highly confidential and could be used against you and even if it is transmitted in a good faith effort to retain us. We reserve the right to decline any representation, and may be required to decline representation if it would create a conflict of interest with our other clients.</p>
<p>(C) <strong>You Should Not Rely on the Information Contained on the Websites.</strong> The information provided on the websites is general in nature and does not apply to any particular factual, legal, medical, financial, insurance, or other situation. As such, you should not rely on any information on our websites, and should seek professional advice as you determine appropriate. In particular, you should consult personally and directly with:</p>
<ul>
<li>an attorney to understand what your legal rights may be in any particular situation;</li>
<li>appropriate medical, health, counseling, or other professionals for any medical, health, counseling, or other similar advice.<br />
For example, if at times you submit an inquiry to a social worker, nurse, or other professional through one of our websites, the response is for your general information only and should not be relied on; and/or</li>
<li>appropriate financial or insurance professionals for advice related to any financial matters, such as related to any stocks or mutual funds, or insurance matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any opinions expressed may not reflect the opinions of the Firm or any individual attorney. Although we strive to keep the content on the websites relevant and useful, laws are often changing, and we cannot guarantee that all of the content is complete, accurate or current.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Content You Submit and Community Usage Rules</span></strong></p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General</span>. The Firm may now or in the future offer users of the websites the opportunity to create, build, post, upload, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise make available on or submit through the websites (collectively, “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">submit</span></strong>”) messages, text, illustrations, files, images, articles, blogs, books, course materials, graphics, photos, comments, responses, sounds, music, audio, videos, information, content, ratings, reviews, data, questions, suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other information or materials and the ideas contained therein (collectively, “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">User-Generated Content</span> </strong>”). Subject to the rights and license you grant in these Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable right,title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Confidentiality of Your User-Generated Content</span>.

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">License to the Firm of Your User-Generated Content</span>. You hereby grant to the Firm, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same.Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, summarize, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials; and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services.In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to the Firm to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to the Firm, and agree to grant to the Firm, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 4(A)(iii).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Firm’s Exclusive Right to Manage our Websites</span>. The Firm may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your User-Generated Content, and the Firm may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate manner. Without limitation, we may do so to address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms, including without limitation, the content restrictions set forth below in the Community Rules (defined in Section 4 (B)). Such User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the websites by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the websites or elsewhere.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Representations and Warranties Related to Your User-Generated Content</span>. Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated Content and grant the Firm the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms, all without any Firm obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Firm; (b) the User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated Content does not and, as to the Firm’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d)the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms (including the Community Rules), or cause injury or harm to any person.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enforcement</span>. The Firm has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at the Firm’s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint the Firm as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled <strong>with an interest</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Community Rules</strong></span>. As a user of the websites, these Community Rules (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Rules</span></strong>”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the websites’ blogs, rating functionality and similar places where you can post comments on the websites (collectively, “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communities</span></strong>”).</p>
<p>(i) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nature of Rules</span>.Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your User-Generated Content</span>. All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family</span>. If you choose to submit photos to the websites, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Act Appropriately</span>. All of your activities on the websites must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the websites. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes</span>. Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes</span>. Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content</span>. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.</li>
