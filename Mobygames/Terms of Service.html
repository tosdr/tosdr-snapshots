<p>2) Intellectual Property</p>
<p>By submitting (e.g., uploading or otherwise transmitting) Content to the MobyGames web site, You warrant that You have all rights necessary to submit such Content free and clear of any rights of any third party and that such Content meets the requirements of these terms and applicable laws.

<p>Further, by submitting Content, you grant to MobyGames a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and MobyGames‚Äô (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.

<p>IV. General</p>
<p>1) Arbitration and Governing Law</p>
<p>Disputes arising under this Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with the substantive law (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of Delaware. The MobyGames and You hereto agree hereby consent to binding arbitration using the American Arbitration Association. MobyGames and You shall be responsible for their own share of the arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules of Arbitration. In the event that either party fails to proceed with arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the arbitrator's award, or fails to comply with the arbitrator's award, the other party is entitled to costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee for having to compel arbitration or defend or enforce the award.</p>
<p>2) Entire Agreement</p>
<p>This Terms of Service is the entire agreement of the MobyGames and You and supersedes any prior agreements, negotiations, or understandings between them, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver, alteration, or modification of any of the provisions of this Terms of Service shall be binding unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the MobyGames.</p>
<p>3) Severability</p>
<p>If any provision of this Terms of Service becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, portions of such provision, or such provision in its entirety, to the extent necessary, shall be severed from this Terms of Service, and such court will replace such illegal, unenforceable or void provision of this Terms of Service with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the same economic, business and other purposes of the illegal, unenforceable or void provision. The balance of this Terms of Service shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>4) Injunctive Relief</p>
<p>In addition to any other available relief, MobyGames and You agree that any commercial use of material obtained from the MobyGames web site including modification, publishing, transmission or participating in the transfer, sale or creation of derivative works, or in any way commercially exploiting the MobyGames web site unless authorized to do so in writing by MobyGames will result in irreparable harm to MobyGames, with damages that cannot be ascertained or compensated by monetary awards; and that, on that basis, You agrees that the MobyGames is entitled to, and may seek and obtain, without the requirement to post bond, any injunctive or immediate legal, equitable, administrative, or other relief available in the country, state, or other jurisdiction appropriate.</p>
