IF, FOR ANY REASON, YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

<p>When We Disclose Information</p>
<p>We may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain products, services, advertisements, promotions, or other features of the Website. </p>
<p>We may disclose some limited information about you to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and create new features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. We disclose information to tax authorities in order to comply with applicable tax laws.</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect us from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Atari, our users, suppliers or others; or to prevent or investigate a possible crime.

You hereby expressly agree that we may collect and process such information in and outside of the United States as well as to transmit such information for processing overseas.</p>
<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>You may decline to share your personally identifiable information with us, in which case we will not be able to provide to you some features and functionality. </p>
<p>You may review and opt out of receiving personalized ads and sharing your information with third parties for direct marketing purposes at any time at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="364543464659444276574257445f1855595b">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>You may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

<p>Data Security </p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may send you a notice if a security breach occurs.</p>
<p>For details about the precise data points we collect and the categories of sources where we got that information, please see ‚ÄúThe Information We Collect‚Äù above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in ‚ÄúThe Way We Use Information‚Äù above.</p>
<p>Atari does not sell the personal information we collect. We do, however, disclose personal information as described in this policy (see ‚ÄúWhen We Disclose Information‚Äù above). In the past 12 months, we have disclosed personal information to the following categories of recipients:</p>
<p>Business partners (for example, if you request that we share your email address with the game seller you purchased an Atari game from such as Steam);</p>
<p>Other Atari products include MobyGames, Atari XP, Atari VCS, Atari SA, Atari Inc., Atari Interactive U.S. Holdings, Inc. etc.</p>
<p>Service providers (as described in ‚ÄúHow Do We Share Information?‚Äù above); and</p>
<p>Operating systems and platforms.</p>
<p>Links To Other Sites</p>
<p>Our Website may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us, including advertisements provided by our ad providers. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
<p>Children‚Äôs Privacy</p>
<p>If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If we learn that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has provided us with personally identifiable information, then please contact us at to have that information deleted.</p>
<p>State-based Privacy Laws</p>
<p>As of the date of this Privacy Policy six states‚ÄîCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah and Virginia‚Äîhave enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws. The laws have several provisions in common, such as the right to access and delete personal information and to opt-out of the sale of personal information, among others.  The following is a brief synopsis of those laws.  If you are a resident of any of these states you should familiarize yourself with the law that applies to your situation, and access it in the event you have any questions not answered below.</p>
<p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act or ‚ÄúCCPA‚Äù (California Civil Code Section 1798.83) permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dba8aeababb4a9af9bbaafbaa9b2f5b8b4b6">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>The CCPA provides consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California resident, you may have the right to: (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose; (2) request deletion of your personal information; (3) opt out of sale of your personal information (if any); and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>
<p>You or your authorized agent may make these requests by contacting us as described in ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù below. Note that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you gave that person authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. </p>
<p>In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information, as described in the CCPA:</p>
<p>Identifiers (such as email addresses);
Demographic information (like ages);
Commercial information (including entitlements or purchase history);
Internet or electronic network activity (for example, gameplay or website usage details);
Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information (like voice chat);
Geolocation information (such as may be derived from your IP address or included in your billing information);
Other ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù as defined under California law (like your credit or debit card information); and
Inferences drawn from any of these categories (for example, about the genres of games you may prefer to play based on your purchase history).</p>
<p>Your Colorado privacy rights </p>
<p>On July 7, 2021, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA).  The CPA will go into effect on July 1, 2023.
