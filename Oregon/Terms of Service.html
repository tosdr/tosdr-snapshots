	  <h2>Introduction and Scope</h2>
      <p class="lead">Thank you for visiting the Oregon.gov website, we are happy that you’re here!</p>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions are the agreement between any person or entity visiting or interacting with the Sites (“You” or “Your”) and the State of Oregon (“Oregon”).  These Terms and Conditions govern Your access and use of Oregon.gov and any other websites or social media accounts operated, controlled, or maintained by Oregon or one of its executive department agencies (“the “Sites”).  Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully because by accessing and continuing to access one or more of the Sites, you accept these Terms and Conditions without limitation and modification.  You also acknowledge that some Sites have additional terms and conditions for the information and services provided by the agencies operating those Sites and your access and use of those Sites means you also accept those additional terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>Oregon operates the Sites for the convenience of its residents and visitors to the state.  The content and services provided by the Sites are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, or that information is accurate or current at the time it is accessed. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Oregon and its agencies and officers from and against any damages and liability based on or arising out of your access or use of content on any of the Sites.</p>
	  </section>
        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Personal Information and Public Records</h3>
          <p>You may be asked or required to submit information that You consider Personal Information (including as defined below) as part of using a Site or using services available through a Site. For purposes of Your use of the Sites and services, we consider "Personal Information" to be information about a person that is readily identifiable to that individual, such as an individual's name, address, and telephone number.</p>
          <p>Personal information is collected when consistent with the intent of statute, state policies, and business needs. Personal Information may be exempt from disclosure if disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the circumstances.</p>
		  <p>Most information collected by state government is assumed to be open to the public unless specifically exempted. ORS Chapter 192 contains the Oregon Public Records Law. Under this law, individuals are permitted to request that public officials not disclose a public record that contains their home address and telephone number under certain circumstances. ORS 192.445 specifies how to request non-disclosure.</p>
		</article>
        <article>
          <h3>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
		  <p>The Sites and services are not designed for, or targeted to reach, children under the age of 13.  Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use services that require submission of Personal Information and should not submit any personal information through a Site, which includes submitting Personal Information to a Site for a user or personalization profile.</p>
		  <p>If You are a child under the age of 13, You can only set up user profiles or submit Personal Information together with your parent(s) or guardian(s). Please seek guidance from your parent(s) or guardian(s) if you are under the age of 13.</p>
		  <p>If an Oregon agency opts to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through a Site, the agency collecting the information will provide notice and follow processes in conformance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For more information on COPPA, please see: <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online</a>. </p>
		</article>
        <article>
          <h3>Information collected while browsing Site web pages</h3>
		  <p>If you browse or download information from a Site, Oregon collects the information below as the standard data collected by all web server software. That collected information is:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user connection (but not an email address). The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned either to an internet service provider or directly to a user’s computer. The IP address is used to respond to a browser request. An IP Address is a numerical label, in the format xxx.xxx.xx.xx, used for network interface or location addressing.</li>
			<li>The domain name assigned to an IP address (if there is one). Example: somename.com</li>
			<li>The type of browser and operating system used. Example: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows NT; IE4WDUS-1998101501)</li>
			<li>The date and time a user visited a Site</li>
			<li>The web pages or services a user accessed at Site</li>
			<li>The website a user visited prior to coming to a Site. (Note: this is included so that summary analysis can be done on how visitors get to our site, i.e., from a search engine, from a link on another site, etc.)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Generally, Sites do not track individual user navigation choices and the information listed above is summarized to determine:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>What organizations are our most frequent users (item 2 above) to better target our content for the audience</li>
			<li>What browsers are being used on our site to determine what techniques we should use to develop pages that will work with different browsers (item 3 above).</li>
			<li>How often our pages are being visited (item 5 above)</li>
			<li>The traffic from organization names such as search engines that direct people to the site (item 6 above)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Some Sites, however, may ask to collect information of an individual to provide services or conduct transactions.  Please see Use of Personal Information.</p>
		  <p>For information security purposes and to ensure Sites and services remain available to users, network traffic is monitored to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If security monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials. </p>
          <p>Except for investigations authorized by law, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on the Sites are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under state law and federal statutes, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.</p>
		</article>
        <article>
            <h3>Use of Personal Information.</h3>
            <p>Some Oregon agencies may collect Personal Information to deliver services or conduct transactions.  You have the right to review your Personal Information collected by any of the Sites by contacting the agency that provided the service you requested.</p>
            <p>Personal Information collected during an online transaction is used for, but not limited to, the following purposes:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Create user accounts or complete online transactions (for example, payment of license fees or tax collection), either on a site hosted on Oregon.gov or a third party website.</li>
			  <li>Send email or otherwise contact the individual to confirm a transaction or identify and resolve problems that occurred during the transaction; or</li>
			  <li>Provide information about state agencies, government services, or about Oregon to visitors who elect to receive this notification service.</li>
  			  <li>Conduct occasional online surveys to improve Site operation or seek opinions of users. These surveys are entirely voluntary and You may easily decline to participate.</li>
			</ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3 id="securetransmission">Secure transmission</h3>
            <p>This site uses the industry standard encryption software Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to enable secure transmission of data. The URL in your browser will change to "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock or key symbol on its task bar to indicate invoked secure transmission. If these indicators are not present, information may be susceptible to interception by other parties. Most internet email communication is not considered secure. If you are communicating sensitive information, consider sending it by postal mail or contacting the agency by phone.</p>
