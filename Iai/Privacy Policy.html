This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by The Institute of Art and Ideas.\n\nAt IAI TV and our affiliated sites, we collect different types of information about our users for four main reasons:\n\n\n1. To provide personalised services unique to individual users.\n\n2. To help us to monitor and improve the user experience and the content we offer.\n\n3. To sell sponsorship and advertising space on the site to selected partners.\n\n4. If we have permission from the user, or where otherwise allowed by law, to market our services and events to them.\n\n\n#### How We Use Your Information\n\nWhat information do we collect?\n\nWe collect information on you:\n\n\u2022 when you subscribe to IAI TV, donate or become an IAI Friend\n\n\u2022 when you use the website\n\n\u2022 through cookies\n\n\u2022 if you choose to reveal information in postings, and\n\n\u2022 when you enter sales promotions and competitions.\n\n\u2022 to process transactions\n\nCertain services that we provide may involve us collecting extra information (IAI Friends memberships, for example), such as where you are, so the service can be provided as designed. \n\nWe will use your information to provide you with the correct services and we may use your information to monitor, improve and protect our website. \n\nWe may adjust the content on our websites and in our communications with you, depending on what we know about your interests. This means we can provide you with personalised content that you may like. \n\nWe may also undertake research to understand which areas of our work you may be interested in supporting by seeking publicly available information. We may also use third-party aggregators of publicly available information to review philanthropic, financial, and professional data. \n\n\n#### Subscription \n\nThe minimum information we need to subscribe you is your name, email address, bank details (or alternative payment method) and a password. We will ask you more questions for different services, including IAI Events and HowTheLightGetsIn ticket sales. Unless we say otherwise, you have to answer all the subscription questions.\n\nWe may also ask some other, voluntary questions when you subscribe for certain services (for example, your profession) so we can gain a clearer understanding of who you are. This also allows us to personalise our services and offering for you.\n\nAfter you have subscribed, and with your permission, we may send you emails we think may interest you. Newsletters may be personalised based on what you have expressed interest in or content that you have accessed on our sites. At any time you can decide not to receive these emails and will be able to \u2018unsubscribe\u2019.\n\n**Payment and credit checks**\n\nWe will use customer information to take payment for our services. Permission to do so will be granted when you provide financial details at purchase.\n\nWe have been granted an SSL certificate, which secures your credit card transactions, data transfer and logins. \n\n##### Logging in using social networking credentials\n\nIf you log-in to our sites using a Facebook log-in, you are granting permission to Facebook to share your user details with us. This will include your name, email address, date of birth and location which will then be used to form an IAI TV account. You can also use your picture from Facebook as part of your profile. This will also allow us and Facebook to share your, networks, user ID and any other information you choose to share according to your Facebook account settings. \n\nIf you log-in to our sites using a Google log-in, you grant permission to Google to share your user details with us. This will include your name, email address, date of birth, sex and location which we will then use to form an IAI TV identity. If you remove the IAI TV from your Google settings, we will no longer have access to this information.\n\n##### Use of Children\u2019s Data\n\nWe do not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 16 and we do not offer any of our products or services directly to children under the age of 13. Registration to the site requires confirmation that you are aged 13 or above, or have the consent of your parent or a person holding parental responsibility.\n\n\n#### Updating Your Personal Information\n\nWe offer a \u2018My details\u2019 page (also known as Email Preferences page), where you can update your preferences at any time. You can get to this page from most pages on the site \u2013 click on the \u2018My account\u2019 link at the top of the screen when you are signed in.\n\nWe will not share your personal information with others for marketing purposes unless you have given us your permission. If we have your permission, we will share your information only with other organisations we have chosen carefully.\n\nIf you are an IAI Friend and attend an event organised by an event partner, data may be shared for event administration purposes.\n\nWe may make other organisations\u2019 services available, through our sites, although we are not necessarily operating these sites. We process any information which we collect when you access a service provided by another organisation under this privacy policy. Information these other organisations collect is governed by their own privacy policies.\n\nWe can access and release personal information to keep to relevant laws and government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both us and our users.\n\nAny other organisations who access your information in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your information and keep to data-protection and privacy laws which apply. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards. We may use service providers to help us run these sites (or services available on the sites), some of whom may be based outside the EEA.\n\nSome of our webpages use plug-ins from other organisations (such as the option to register through Facebook). These other organisations may use information about your visit to our websites on their pages.
