			<h4 id="rewardsprograms">8. Rewards Programs</h4>
            <div class="content">
				<p>
					A. In connection with your use of the Applications/Services, you may have the opportunity to accumulate rewards, incentives and entries into prize draws or sweepstakes. Incentives may be in the form of points or program/panel currency (“<strong>Panel Currency</strong>”). Panel Currency has no monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash; Panel Currency may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold and is not transferrable upon death, by gift, as part of a domestic relations matter, or otherwise, except by operation of law. Information, official rules and terms and conditions for rewards, incentives and prize draws or sweepstakes may be available in these Terms, on the Website for a Panel, at the beginning or end of a survey, in survey invitations, on the website(s) or webpage(s) for redeeming rewards, incentives, and prizes, and/or may be described in any newsletter or other communication distributed or published by Dynata.
					<br><br>
					The various types of incentives and rewards Dynata may provide are to encourage participation in the Panel and are not compensation for time spent.  Any points or Panel Currency that is earned or paid to you or any reward that is redeemed by you for participation in the Research or other activity on a Panel is not calculated based on time spent by you. Similarly, any consideration paid to or points earned by you for participation is not pro-rated on an hourly basis or otherwise.
					<br><br>
					B. All points or Panel Currency posted to a Panel member’s account expire one (1) year following posting, unless the points or Panel Currency are forfeited or canceled earlier due to membership or account inactivity or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Panel member accounts are not actual bank or financial accounts and do not accrue or accumulate interest of any kind.
					<br><br>
					C. Points or Panel Currency posted in connection with the Applications/Services do not constitute property of the Panel member, cannot be transferred during or after the Panel member’s life, by operation of law or otherwise, and have no value until presented by the Panel member for redemption in accordance with these Terms.
					<br><br>
					D. In the event that any points, Panel Currency, or incentive have been erroneously posted to a Panel member’s account, Dynata may remove them from the Panel member’s account.
					<br><br>
					E. In the event that any points, Panel Currency, or incentive have been obtained and/or posted to a Panel member’s account through fraudulent means, Dynata will remove them from the Panel member’s account and the account may be suspended and/or terminated.
					<br><br>
					F.  Redemption
					<br>
					(1)	Points or Panel Currency will be deducted from the Panel member's account at the time the redemption request is made.
					<br>
					(2)	All redemptions are final, and rewards may not be returned for credit except as otherwise provided in these Terms or as otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Dynata.
					<br>
					(3) The minimum points or Panel Currency redemption threshold required to redeem a reward is the equivalent of Fifty United States Dollars ($50). Unless there is a lower redemption option available, if you do not satisfy the foregoing threshold, you will not have a redemption option under Dynata’s rewards program. Dynata reserves the right to provide reward options with lower minimum redemption thresholds without prior notice to or consent from you.
<br>
(4) Dynata has engaged and from time-to-time will engage certain third party ID verification service providers, listed
here: <a href="https://www.veriff.com/privacy-notice" target="_blank">Veriff</a> in connection with the redemption
process. In order to redeem rewards, you may be asked
to verify your identity through our third party ID verification service
provider's platform. In all cases, such service providers shall be subject to appropriate agreements concerning data
processing,
confidentiality, etc.
					<br><br>
					G. Dynata may modify, alter, delete or add new terms and conditions for its rewards program or the Applications/Services at any time without notice. For Dynata this includes, but is not limited to, modifying, altering, adding or deleting point values, redemption levels, conversion ratios, conditions for status, conditions for membership and conditions for earning incentives or rewards, at any time without notice. In addition, Dynata may terminate or cease offering any incentive or reward in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, at any time without notice.
					<br><br>
					H. You may not combine your points or Panel Currency with points or Panel Currency belonging to any other member, including, but not limited to, any family member or friend.
					<br><br>
					I. Dynata make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding any product or service received in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, including, but not limited to, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Dynata is not, and will not be, liable or responsible for the performance of, or for the failure of the performance of, any product or service for which points or Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. In addition, Dynata is not and will not be responsible or liable for any cost, damage, accident, delay, injury, loss, expense or inconvenience that may arise in connection with the use of, or defect in, any product or service for which points, Panel Currency, incentives or rewards are redeemed. Dynata will not replace any lost, stolen, misplaced or damaged incentives or rewards.
					<br><br>
					J. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE POINTS, PANEL CURRENCY, INCENTIVES OR REWARDS EARNED THROUGH THE APPLICATIONS/SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX, WHICH IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PANEL MEMBER. Dynata may provide you and/or the appropriate government agency or taxing authority with information related to any payments or incentives you earn in connection with your use of the Applications/Services. You agree to provide Dynata with all required information to assist Dynata in complying with its reporting or withholding obligations. Dynata may withhold any tax from any incentive or reward as required by applicable law.
					<br><br>
					K. Dynata donates USD $30,000 to American Red Cross on a quarterly basis throughout the year. This donation is separate
to the incentives you receive for surveys and does not come from your points balance.
					<br><br>
					L. Dynata uses reasonable efforts to ensure that points or Panel Currency are credited and debited appropriately; however, the Panel member should review their account to ensure that their account correctly identifies the posted points or Panel Currency, incentives, or rewards, and reflects all of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@quickthoughtsapp.com">helpdesk@quickthoughtsapp.com</a>. Any email sent to Dynata should include the Panel member’s name, email address and specific information on the subject matter. Dynata will use reasonable efforts to investigate the matter and to respond back to the Panel member promptly. Dynata's decision is final and binding.
					<br><br>
					M. The suppliers or providers of the products or services offered in connection with Dynata’s rewards program and/or the owners or operators of the website(s)/webpage(s) on which redemption transactions occur, may have their own terms and conditions; please review these terms and conditions carefully.
					<br><br>
					N. Personal information may have to be collected, processed and/or disclosed in connection with Dynata’s rewards program and/or any request to redeem a reward or incentive. By agreeing to these Terms, you hereby agree to the collection, processing and/or disclosure of your personal information for such purpose(s) and all such personal information shall be subject to the terms set forth in Dynata’s Privacy Policy. Redemption of Virtual Mastercard® or Visa® may require verification of your identity by the financial institution responsible for issuing your Virtual Mastercard® and Visa®, and that such verification may require you to provide your date of birth, tax identification number, and similar information.
					<br><br>
					O. If a Panel member elects to donate points or Panel Currency to one of the charities approved by Dynata, Dynata will donate said points or Panel Currency to the selected charity. The donation is not made by or on behalf of Dynata and Dynata does not and will not match any donation. Please note that the donation option is not available on every panel owned and/or operated by or on behalf of Dynata. Please check the redemption options available for the panel to which you belong.
					<br><br>
					P. Your daily limit on the redemption of points or Panel Currency is limited to two (2) redemptions per 24-hour period.
					<br><br>
					Q. In the United States, Dynata has an obligation to: (i) provide a W-9 tax form to individuals who receive payments (whether via the redemption of points or Panel Currency or other means) of $600 or more in a tax year; and (ii) file a 1099-Misc form with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for such payments. In addition, Dynata will provide you with a completed 1099-Misc form for your tax compliance purposes. As a result, please see the following:
					<br>
					(1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will not
be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in surveys) for the
remainder of the applicable tax year unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.
					<br>
					(2) If you have received payments of $600 or more during a tax year, your account will be suspended indefinitely (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in surveys) unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form. In this case, your account will not be reinstated at the beginning of the next tax year, unless or until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.
<br>
(3) You agree to provide Dynata with your then-current address information. You have the responsibility to update Dynata

			<h4 id="arbritation">22. Arbitration Agreement (United States only)</h4>
			<div class="content">
                <p>
					All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Section 22 (this “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
					<br><br>
					Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite 300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
					<br><br>
					Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“<strong>ADR Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) governing the arbitration are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
					<br><br>
					If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
					<br><br>
					If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
					<br><br>
					If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Dynata.
					<br><br>
					THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
					<br><br>
					ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
					<br><br>
					All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
					<br><br>
					Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
					<br><br>
					This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.
					<br><br>
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims court.
					<br><br>
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
					<br><br>
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
					<br><br>
					In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA for such purpose.

This License does not allow you to use the Apps on any device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the Apps available over a network where they could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apps. Subject to any rights you may have under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) or the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Apps, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any free or open sourced components included with the Apps). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Research Now and its licensors. If you breach this License, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the License will govern any upgrades provided by Research Now that replace or supplement the original App or App+, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t2.2 \u003cu\u003eTermination.\u003c/u\u003e The License is effective until terminated by you or Research Now.

Upon termination of the License, you shall cease all use of the Apps, and permanently delete all copies of the Apps. Research Now’s termination of this EULA will not limit any of Research Now’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. The provisions of Sections (including subsections): 2.2, 3, and 6 - 13 shall survive termination or expiration of this EULA, for any reason.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t3. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eConsent to Use of Data.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e You agree that Research Now may collect and use data and information from your device through the use of the Apps, such information can include but is not limited to technical information about your device, its operating system and application software, location/GPS information, device usage, phone, SMS/text usage (but no content is collected, only usage metrics), website usage, search usage, use of other applications, music, email usage, network carrier, camera usage that is gathered periodically to facilitate the allocation and assignment of relevant and targeted surveys and other related services associated to the business of the Research Now in connection with your use of the App or App+. Research Now may use this information in connection with its business in compliance with the Mobile Applications Privacy Policy located at \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.jetopinions.com/mobile-privacy\"\u003e\n\t\thttps://www.jetopinions.com/mobile-privacy \n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t. Apps communicate via the Internet with Research Now servers. If you do not have an unlimited mobile data plan with your carrier, standard data transmission rates likely apply. Research Now may make routine software updates without informing you to keep the Apps working properly. The App+ will not ordinarily be visible to you during your device usage, but can be easily found in the list of installed applications on your mobile device. For you to participate in location based surveys, you must agree to share GPS information from your device. The Apps collect location information in processes executing in the background of your device to support the functionalities and features of the Apps, including location based surveys and location analytics. Note, that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Upon first use, the Apps ask for your permission and consent to collect user information and location information and upon acceptance, you can start using the App or App+ (as applicable). To the extent that you permit a third party to use your device, you warrant that you have provided any necessary notifications and obtained the necessary consents and approvals from that third party for Research Now to continue to collect user information and location information from your device. Certain mobile operating systems have options to restrict the collection of certain location and usage information. In the event that you have those options enabled, you will restrict certain functionality of the Apps, and may not be participating in the full Jet Opinions Mobile program, including location based surveys. If you wish to stop participating, uninstall the App or App+ at any time from your device.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t4. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSupport and Subscription Services Not Included.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Research Now will not provide any support services under this EULA.

Under our agreement with Flurry, Flurry will provide us with certain data about your device containing the Apps and your use of the Apps. Flurry’s collection and use of data from end users of mobile applications using the Flurry SDK or other Flurry advertising services (“Flurry Data”) are described in Flurry’s privacy policy which you can access here: http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html. You may continue your Research Now membership and opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device by following the instructions located at http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html. If you opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device, Flurry will discontinue sharing data with us. If you do not opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device, to the extent that the data includes personal information about you, you authorize us to collect such information from Flurry. You may have other third-party applications on your device which contain the Flurry SDK (“Third-Party Apps”). We may be engaged by the owners or licensors of the Third-Party Apps (“Third Parties”) to provide survey research services regarding you and your use of the Third Party Apps. Upon the request of such third party to us and to Flurry, Flurry may share data that it collects from your device related to that Third-Party App with us. The data collection and use practices described in Flurry’s privacy policy or any other Third-Party’s privacy policy are independent from our data collection practices through your participation in the Apps or our other mobile applications. To the extent that the data from the Third-Party App that is shared with us includes personal information about you, you authorize us to collect such information from Flurry. We may share your profile data, survey responses and, if you use the App+ application, your mobile behavioral data with Flurry, and Flurry may associate such information with Flurry Data that is specific to your device. When Flurry combines your profile data and survey responses collected through the Apps, and, if applicable, your mobile behavioral data collected through the App+ application, with Flurry Data specific to your device, Flurry may use the resulting data subject to applicable law and industry standards. When Flurry shares Flurry Data with us as described above, we may use such Flurry Data in the same manner as your profile data, survey responses and, in the case of the App+ application, your mobile behavioral data, described herein.

However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal actually to work as you might want can be very difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser or device might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control what other websites do.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli value=\"9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Opt-Out Policy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tIf you would like to opt out of Research Now membership, you may request that your membership be cancelled and your account closed by contacting us by any means provided in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
