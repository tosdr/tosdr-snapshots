			<h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
			<p>
				The following is the QuickThoughts privacy policy for residents of the United States of America and is the policy of Dynata, LLC on behalf of itself and all members of the Dynata corporate family (collectively “Dynata”). All such entities globally shall have access to personal data collected pursuant to this policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>First Effective: August 15, 2013</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>This Version: Effective December 30, 2022</strong></p>
			<p>
				The following sets forth the privacy policy for the Dynata,LLC online panel communities, the Dynata,LLC panel websites and/or the Dynata,LLC mobile applications (collectively "Application/Services") offered by Dynata.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information ("<strong>PII</strong>") and other information by Dynata in connection with Dynata’s Services as defined herein and other Dynata and third party activities as defined herein ("Non-Research Activities").  Dynata’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a panel, participate in surveys administered by Dynata or by third parties (whether as a panel member or a non-panel member), use the websites associated with the panels, use the Application/Services associated with the panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively "<strong>Services</strong>"). Non-Research Activities include, but are not limited to, Dynata marketing Dynata Services and/or third parties marketing their services to you and/or sharing individual and/or aggregate profile data with third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models.  Non-Research Activities are described in more detail in this Privacy Policy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your use of Dynata's Application/Services is completely voluntary and therefore Dynata's processing of your PII in connection with the Application/Services and Non-Research Activities and this Privacy Policy is with your consent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surveys administered by third parties and the data collected in connection therewith are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Registration with, use of, and access to Dynata's Services is subject to <a href="terms">Dynata's Terms and Conditions</a>. In most cases Dynata is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data will be owned by the sponsor of the survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				All references to "us" or "we" refer to Dynata. All PII is stored in the United States, where Dynata's servers are located and accessible globally to Dynata employees and/or agents. For purposes of this policy, respondent shall mean any individual who participates in Dynata Services, including passive data collection and/or participates in the Non-Research Activities described herein. For purposes of this policy, online shall include mobile web browsing,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h2 id="information"><strong>What personal data and other information does the Application/Services collect and how is it used?</strong></h2>
			<p>
				Dynata collects personally identifiable information ("PII") from research participants during and after registration with a panel, including, without limitation, during participation in a survey and in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives and/or during the Application/Services registration and download process. You will be asked to provide certain PII and demographic information, including, without limitation, your name, address(es), telephone number(s) (including home, cell, and/or business telephone numbers), email address(es), date of birth, and occupation/education, the unique panelist/respondent identification number we assign to you when you sign up for an account (individually a "<strong>UID</strong>" and collectively "<strong>UIDs</strong>"), and racial and gender information. In addition to the collection of PII mentioned above, during and subsequent to the registration process, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Data. "<strong>Sensitive Data</strong>" means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dynata collects PII, Sensitive Data and demographic information from non-panel members prior to and during participation in a survey.
			</p>
			<p>

Dynata, the clients and/or ad partners may use this information to facilitate Dynata surveys, for marketing of Dynata products and services to you, for Non-Research Activities, to link your device to additional data about you and/or your device available from third party data management platforms and data providers/brokers and/or to validate certain information you provide about yourself and/or your device.

			</p>
			<p>
				First party and third party cookies and other similar or related technology and device identifiers (e.g., IDFAs, AAIDs, etc.) may be placed, written, set, and/or read for several purposes including, without limitation, to provide a better survey experience, quality control, validation, to enable or facilitate survey participation, tracking of completed surveys or other completed actions, for fraud detection and/or prevention, online ad effectiveness research, website tracking and audience measurement, to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns, and for the purpose of targeting advertisements and other content to individuals, subject to your consent where required by applicable law.

			<h3><strong>How does Dynata use the information it collects?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				<u>Dynata's use of information:</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the purposes described above, Dynata uses personal data collected through the Application/Services as follows: (i) to communicate with you regarding your membership with a survey panel(s) owned by Dynata; (ii) to communicate with you regarding your participation in a survey(s); (iii) to tailor survey opportunities to you and to arrange for advertisements to be displayed to you outside the Application/Services for the purposes of facilitating the completion of advertisement recall surveys; (iv) to send you notifications of survey opportunities; (v) to comply with any and all legal obligations, including, without limitation, tax obligations; (vi) to administer and manage Dynata's reward and incentive programs and fulfill your requests for rewards and incentives; (vii) to facilitate your entry into Dynata's sweepstakes and promotions and communicate with you regarding such entries; (viii) to update Dynata's records; (ix) to comply with any data suppression obligations or requirements; (x) for fraud detection and/or prevention purposes; (xi) to link your device and/or profile to additional information available about you and/or your device available from data management platforms ("DMP"); (xii) to market Dynata products/services to you; (xiii) to enable third parties to market their products/services to you; (xiv) to enable Dynata or third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models; (xv) to validate the profile information you provided to us; and/or (xvi) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy or as otherwise authorized by you. Dynata may use information collected in the context of the Application/Services in connection with other survey panels that Dynata administers and/or in connection with Non-Research Activities. With respect to the linking of Application/Services data to third party DMP data, Dynata uses such data itself and/or permits Dynata's clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using "look alike" cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party's products/services to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Retargeting</u>. Dynata may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an Dynata website(s) or to manage Dynata's advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). Dynata's third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements. Including but not limited to your IDFA or Advertising ID to gather information about your activities on Dynata's website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about Dynata and its services and/or (ii) assist Dynata in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If Dynata is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in Dynata's separate cookie notice, by modifying your IDFA or Advertising ID and/or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Audience Insights/Look-alikes</u>. Dynata and/or third parties may use Personal Data and/or may link Personal Data to a third-party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Online Advertising Effectiveness</u>. In connection with Dynata's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that Dynata is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, Dynata's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a "<strong>Third Party Technology</strong>" and collectively the "<strong>Third Party Technologies</strong>"). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, Dynata's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and Dynata's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, Dynata's client will send your UID and the specific survey to Dynata and Dynata will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Audience Measurement Data</u>. In addition to the use and sharing of Audience Measurement Data (as defined below) in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, as such research is described above, Dynata may share your UID and data previously collected by Dynata, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, ("<strong>Audience Measurement Data</strong>"), to third parties, including, without limitation, Dynata's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the content, advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, and to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).
			</p>
			<h3><strong>How do advertisers/ad networks use my information?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				<u>Ad partners' use of information.</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "<u>Information collected through automated means</u>" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes. To learn more about some of these ad companies, including how to opt out, please visit the following:

				<p>
					In addition to the foregoing, if you enroll through a third party with whom Dynata has a contractual relationship and/or from an email sent from a third party company proposing you to join our Application/Services (collectively "Program Partner"), Dynata may share select enrollment information with the Program Partner who invited you into the program, which can include your full name, post or zip code, and your email address.

				</p>
				<p>
					Please note, Dynata may allow a client to collect PII directly from respondents. The disclosure is voluntary and, prior to collection, the client is required to enter into a written agreement with Dynata, which, among other things, limits use of the PII.

				<p>
					In connection with your survey data, Dynata or the client may associate certain demographic attributes to you.

Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or aggregate summary form (i.e. a group of respondents).

This License does not allow you to use the Apps on any device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the Apps available over a network where they could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apps. Subject to any rights you may have under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) or the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Apps, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any free or open sourced components included with the Apps). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Research Now and its licensors. If you breach this License, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the License will govern any upgrades provided by Research Now that replace or supplement the original App or App+, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t2.2 \u003cu\u003eTermination.\u003c/u\u003e The License is effective until terminated by you or Research Now. Your rights under this License will terminate immediately without notice from Research Now if you fail to comply with the Terms or upon termination of this EULA by Research Now or you. Upon termination of the License, you shall cease all use of the Apps, and permanently delete all copies of the Apps. Research Now’s termination of this EULA will not limit any of Research Now’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. The provisions of Sections (including subsections): 2.2, 3, and 6 - 13 shall survive termination or expiration of this EULA, for any reason.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t3. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eConsent to Use of Data.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e You agree that Research Now may collect and use data and information from your device through the use of the Apps, such information can include but is not limited to technical information about your device, its operating system and application software, location/GPS information, device usage, phone, SMS/text usage (but no content is collected, only usage metrics), website usage, search usage, use of other applications, music, email usage, network carrier, camera usage that is gathered periodically to facilitate the allocation and assignment of relevant and targeted surveys and other related services associated to the business of the Research Now in connection with your use of the App or App+. Research Now may use this information in connection with its business in compliance with the Mobile Applications Privacy Policy located at \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.jetopinions.com/mobile-privacy\"\u003e\n\t\thttps://www.jetopinions.com/mobile-privacy \n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t. Apps communicate via the Internet with Research Now servers. If you do not have an unlimited mobile data plan with your carrier, standard data transmission rates likely apply. Research Now may make routine software updates without informing you to keep the Apps working properly. The App+ will not ordinarily be visible to you during your device usage, but can be easily found in the list of installed applications on your mobile device. For you to participate in location based surveys, you must agree to share GPS information from your device. The Apps collect location information in processes executing in the background of your device to support the functionalities and features of the Apps, including location based surveys and location analytics. Note, that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Upon first use, the Apps ask for your permission and consent to collect user information and location information and upon acceptance, you can start using the App or App+ (as applicable). To the extent that you permit a third party to use your device, you warrant that you have provided any necessary notifications and obtained the necessary consents and approvals from that third party for Research Now to continue to collect user information and location information from your device. Certain mobile operating systems have options to restrict the collection of certain location and usage information. In the event that you have those options enabled, you will restrict certain functionality of the Apps, and may not be participating in the full Jet Opinions Mobile program, including location based surveys. If you wish to stop participating, uninstall the App or App+ at any time from your device.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t4. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSupport and Subscription Services Not Included.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Research Now will not provide any support services under this EULA.

Under our agreement with Flurry, Flurry will provide us with certain data about your device containing the Apps and your use of the Apps. Flurry’s collection and use of data from end users of mobile applications using the Flurry SDK or other Flurry advertising services (“Flurry Data”) are described in Flurry’s privacy policy which you can access here: http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html. You may continue your Research Now membership and opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device by following the instructions located at http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html. If you opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device, Flurry will discontinue sharing data with us. If you do not opt out of Flurry’s collection of data from your device, to the extent that the data includes personal information about you, you authorize us to collect such information from Flurry. You may have other third-party applications on your device which contain the Flurry SDK (“Third-Party Apps”). We may be engaged by the owners or licensors of the Third-Party Apps (“Third Parties”) to provide survey research services regarding you and your use of the Third Party Apps. Upon the request of such third party to us and to Flurry, Flurry may share data that it collects from your device related to that Third-Party App with us. The data collection and use practices described in Flurry’s privacy policy or any other Third-Party’s privacy policy are independent from our data collection practices through your participation in the Apps or our other mobile applications. To the extent that the data from the Third-Party App that is shared with us includes personal information about you, you authorize us to collect such information from Flurry. We may share your profile data, survey responses and, if you use the App+ application, your mobile behavioral data with Flurry, and Flurry may associate such information with Flurry Data that is specific to your device. When Flurry combines your profile data and survey responses collected through the Apps, and, if applicable, your mobile behavioral data collected through the App+ application, with Flurry Data specific to your device, Flurry may use the resulting data subject to applicable law and industry standards. When Flurry shares Flurry Data with us as described above, we may use such Flurry Data in the same manner as your profile data, survey responses and, in the case of the App+ application, your mobile behavioral data, described herein.

However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal actually to work as you might want can be very difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser or device might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control what other websites do.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli value=\"9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Opt-Out Policy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tIf you would like to opt out of Research Now membership, you may request that your membership be cancelled and your account closed by contacting us by any means provided in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
