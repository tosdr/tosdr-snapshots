          <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This Arizona State University (<strong>ASU</strong>) Privacy Statement provides information required by Arizona law about ASU’s online information gathering and dissemination practices. Individual pages on ASU websites may provide additional information.</p>

<p>In addition to the information in this Privacy Statement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asu.edu/tou/">ASU’s Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Information Management Policy</a>&nbsp;set forth requirements that you must follow when using ASU’s websites and technology network.</p>

<p>If you are in the European Union, please also review&nbsp;<a href="/about/privacy#nav-european-union-supplement">ASU’s Supplemental Privacy Provisions for Persons in the European Union</a>. These EU Supplemental Privacy Provisions provide additional information regarding ASU’s processing of personal data you submit or disclose to ASU (or to a third party that transfers it to ASU for processing) while you are in the European Union, Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction that has enacted similar privacy laws.</p>

<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement, as well as any information linked from this Privacy Statement, because we may update it from time to time.</p>

<h3>Services ASU provides online, and services provided by non-ASU service providers</h3>

<p>ASU’s websites provide online information and services to all users of ASU’s technology network (<strong>Users</strong>) consistent with&nbsp;<a href="https://president.asu.edu/asu-mission-and-goals">ASU’s Charter and Mission</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to information and services provided on ASU websites, ASU may also provide connections to external services and information provided by non-ASU service providers. These non-ASU provided services may include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft 365 and Windows, and the education versions of Dropbox and Google, which includes Gmail. Non-ASU service providers have their own privacy policies that are not covered by this Privacy Statement. ASU is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of non-ASU service providers. We recommend you review the privacy practices and policies of all non-ASU service providers.</p>

<h3>Information ASU collects from users and how we use it</h3>

<p>ASU collects information actively provided by Users. We may also collect information about the computers, mobile devices, or other devices you use to access ASU’s websites and technology network, such as IP address, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, web pages visited, network software access, referring web pages, date, time, and duration of activity, passwords, and accounts accessed, volume of data storage and transfers, and locations of User devices when connected to ASU’s websites and technology network. Logs of this information may be retained. We may contract with non-ASU service providers to help us better understand Users.</p>

<p>ASU uses information collected to provide services, in support of ASU’s Charter and Mission, to protect the security of ASU’s technology network, to support academic integrity, and to provide safety and security services to Users, as well as to monitor, preserve, and enhance the use, functioning, and integrity of ASU’s technology network. ASU may also use information collected from you for analysis and statistical purposes consistent with ASU’s Charter and Mission.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computing devices. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about network traffic and network interaction so that we can offer better network experiences and tools in the future. Cookies may be set by organizations other than ASU. Because the cookie policies of these third party service providers may change over time, you should review their policies by visiting their privacy policies directly. We also use targeting and advertising cookies, which may be set by ASU or by third parties. Users may disable cookies through their individual browser options. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or technology network.</p>

<p>The following describes the types of cookies ASU uses on our websites:</p>

<p><strong>Required or strictly necessary cookies.</strong>&nbsp;These cookies are essential for our websites to operate correctly and to provide you with requested services. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you, so when you log on to ASU websites, we know who you are.</p>

<p><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong>&nbsp;We use functionality cookies to enhance website features, such as videos and live chat, and for personalization, such as storing your preferences (e.g. username and language selection). Functionality cookies may be set by ASU or by third parties whose services we have added to our websites. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or technology network, and some website may not work properly.</p>

<p><strong>Social media cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Social media cookies may be set by third parties such as YouTube and Facebook to collect information about your social media usage.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Analytics cookies collect information about your use of our websites and technology network, and help us improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies identify the most frequently visited pages, record any difficulties you have, and show whether our advertising is effective. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze the websites' traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Targeting/advertising cookies.</strong>&nbsp;We use targeting/advertising cookies to create profiles and personalize content. We may use third party products, such as Google Analytics, to market ASU’s services to you on third party websites. For example, if you visit ASU websites, you may then see advertisements for ASU on other websites.</p>

<p>You can learn more about cookies and their functions generally by visiting an information website such as&nbsp;<a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/">allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do not track signals.</strong>&nbsp;Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" (<strong>DNT</strong>) feature that tells websites that users do not want to have their online activity tracked.</p>

<h3>Alternatives to website transactions</h3>

<p>If you prefer not to provide information to ASU through our websites or technology network, you may contact the ASU administrative unit responsible for the service to learn about available options.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of information</h3>

<p>ASU does not disclose confidential information we collect online to individuals or entities not affiliated with ASU, except in the limited circumstances described below. Non-confidential information may be disclosed or distributed pursuant to federal laws, state laws, including Arizona’s public records laws, and ASU and Arizona Board of Regents (<strong>ABOR</strong>) policies. These laws and policies explain what information may be shared or disclosed. They also explain what information is protected as confidential.</p>

<p><strong>Student Records.</strong>&nbsp;Certain records of students are protected by the federal&nbsp;<a href="https://students.asu.edu/policies/ferpa">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<strong>FERPA</strong>)</a>, Arizona law, and ASU Policy. Information about students’ access to their education records and protection of education records is available in ASU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm107-01.html">Student Services Manual in Section 107-01</a>. This policy also provides information on students’ rights to limit access to their directory information. ASU may disclose confidential student information with the consent of the student, under subpoena or court order, or in other limited circumstances as permitted by FERPA and other applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>Employee records.</strong>&nbsp;Access to ASU personnel records is governed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.azregents.edu/privacy-policy">ABOR Policy 6-912</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd811.html">ACD 811</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/policyarchives/SPP/Mar2008/spp1101.html">SPP 1101</a>, and Arizona law.</p>

<p><strong>Public records laws.</strong>&nbsp;ASU may be required to provide access to ASU records to third parties pursuant to Arizona’s public records laws&nbsp;<a href="http://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=39">ARS §§ 39-121 through 39-161</a>. Additional information about Arizona’s public records laws is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://ogc.asu.edu/public-records/">ogc.asu.edu/public-records/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Court order or public safety.</strong>&nbsp;ASU may be required to disclose confidential information pursuant to a valid court order or lawfully issued and served subpoena, search warrant, or other legal order. In addition, ASU may disclose confidential information to law enforcement if ASU believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ASU, to protect the health or safety of individuals, or if law enforcement believes that ASU’s resources have been used in the commission of a crime.</p>

<p><strong>Contractors.</strong>&nbsp;ASU may contract with non-ASU service providers to provide services and information through ASU’s websites and technology network. ASU may provide information, including personal information collected on our technology network; to non-ASU service providers to assist ASU deliver classes, programs, products, information, and services. ASU also contracts with non-ASU service providers to perform analysis, research, and administrative activities for ASU. ASU requires non-ASU service providers to protect personal information on our behalf.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>ASU takes steps to ensure that confidential information collected online is secure. These steps include: ongoing User education; using tools in an effort to restrict unauthorized access, viruses, phishing, and hacking attempts; and monitoring activity to identify potential system threats. ASU routinely assesses and enhances tools and processes available to strengthen our online security.</p>

<h3>Contact information</h3>

<p>If you believe ASU has not adhered to this Privacy Statement, please contact ASU’s privacy team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@asu.edu">privacy@asu.edu</a>. ASU will use reasonable efforts to address your concerns; although there may be circumstances where we cannot assist.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>We will publish on our website any changes we make to this Privacy Statement.</p>

          <h3>Supplemental ASU Privacy Provisions for Persons in the European Union</h3>

<h4>A. Applicability and Definitions</h4>

<p>These Supplemental Privacy Provisions for Persons in the European Union (<strong>EU Privacy Provisions</strong>) are provided pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data”) (the <strong>GDPR</strong>), effective May 25, 2018.</p>

<p>These EU Privacy Provisions supplement <a href="/about/privacy#nav-asu-privacy-statement">ASU’s Privacy Statement</a>, and should be read together with ASU’s Privacy Statement. These EU Privacy Provisions are intended to be consistent with the GDPR principles of privacy, fairness, lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and accountability. For more information regarding the GDPR and these principles, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en#legislation">full text of the GDPR is available here</a>. Terms in these EU Privacy Provisions are used consistent with their definitions in the GDPR.</p>

<p>These EU Privacy Provisions apply to you only if and to the extent ASU is Processing your EU Personal Data, where the Processing is related to ASU offering goods or services to you, or ASU is monitoring your behavior in the EU (e.g., through online course proctoring, or location tracking).</p>

<p><strong>Personal Data</strong> means any information, recorded in any form, relating to you that can identify you, directly or indirectly, such as your name, date of birth, addresses (including email addresses), identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.</p>

<p><strong>EU Personal Data</strong> means Personal Data you submit or disclose to ASU (or to a third party that transfers it to ASU for Processing) while you are in the European Union or another jurisdiction that has adopted the GDPR or regulations substantially similar to the GDPR, such as Switzerland (<strong>EU</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Processing</strong> (and <strong>Process</strong>) includes collecting, recording, organizing, storing, transferring, sharing, disclosing, erasing, or destroying your EU Personal Data, whether or not via ASU’s technology network.</p>

<p>ASU may Process your EU Personal Data in accordance with these EU Privacy Provisions, <a href="https://www.asu.edu/tou/">ASU’s Terms of Use</a>, <a href="/about/privacy#nav-asu-privacy-statement">ASU’s Privacy Statement</a>, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these EU Privacy Provisions, please do not provide any EU Personal Data to ASU. If you choose not to provide any EU Personal Data that is necessary for ASU to provide you with specific products or services, ASU may not be able to provide those products or services to you.</p>

<h4>B. EU Personal Data ASU Collects and How We Use It</h4>

<p><strong>Collection of Your EU Personal Data.</strong> ASU collects EU Personal Data from you:</p>

<ul class="maroon uds-list">
	<li>When you apply for admission to ASU from the EU</li>
	<li>When you enroll or participate, from the EU, in classes or programs given by ASU, online or in person</li>
	<li>When you register from the EU for an online account from ASU, or update or change, from the EU, information for your account</li>
	<li>When you participate from the EU in ASU classes or programs using ASU’s websites and technology network, such as when you turn in assignments and projects online, use online courseware or proctoring services, participate in online discussions and forums, and communicate with ASU faculty and staff</li>
	<li>When you send ASU emails and other communications from the EU</li>
	<li>When you inquire about or apply for employment with ASU from the EU</li>
	<li>When you, from the EU, complete a survey for, submit information to, or request information from, ASU</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Your EU Personal Data.</strong> ASU may use your EU Personal Data to respond to your questions, provide you specific courses, services, products, programs and/or services you select, satisfy our contractual obligations to you, send you updates and information regarding ASU, send you email messages about maintenance or updates of ASU’s technology network, and to support of ASU’s alumni relations and fundraising. We may also: archive your EU Personal Data; use it for research and analytics purposes; use it for future communications with you; use it to establish, exercise, and defend legal claims; use it for reasons of substantial public interest, including archiving purposes; use it for historical, scientific, research, or statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards; and use it for the legitimate interests of ASU or any third party to whom ASU discloses your EU Personal Data, if your fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.</p>

<p><strong>Lawfulness of Processing.</strong> ASU’s Processing of your EU Personal Data for the interdependent purposes set out in these EU Privacy Provisions is necessary for one or more of the following:</p>

<ul class="maroon uds-list">
	<li>Pursuing ASU’s legitimate interests</li>
	<li>Carrying out a task in the public interest</li>
	<li>Exercising ASU’s official authority as a constitutionally created institution governed by the Arizona Board of Regents, a body corporate of the sovereign State of Arizona, in the United States of America</li>
	<li>Performing a contract with you, or to take steps at your request prior to contracting with you</li>
	<li>Protecting your vital interests or the interests of another person</li>
	<li>Complying with ASU’s legal obligations</li>
</ul>

<h4>C. Specific Guidance</h4>

<p>In addition to the information provided above, this Section provides additional information regarding how ASU Processes your EU Personal Data in specific situations.</p>

<p><strong>Applications for Student Admissions from the EU.</strong> This part applies if, while you are in the EU, you apply for admission as a student to ASU (including as an exchange or visiting student), whether you intend to attend ASU online, remotely, or on campus, and whether you submit your application through ASU’s online student application portals (<a href="https://students.asu.edu/apply">Undergraduate</a>, <a href="https://students.asu.edu/graduate/apply-graduate-admission">Graduate</a>), through a third party such as the <a href="https://students.asu.edu/apply">Common Application</a>, or directly via communications with an ASU department, program, or school.
