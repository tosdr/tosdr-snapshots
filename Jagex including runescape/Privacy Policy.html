<h2 id="40-third-party-links">4.0 THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>

When you leave Our website, We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>
<h2 id="50-the-data-we-collect-about-you">5.0 THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>

<p>We also collect, use, and share aggregated data, such as statistical or demographic data, for any purpose. Aggregated data is derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, We aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.

In addition, We limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, professional advisers, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know on the principle of least privilege (PoLP). They will only process your Personal Data on Our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We periodically review all privacy and security policies and update them when necessary, in line with changes in Data Protection Laws or when new technologies are introduced into Our business.</p>
<p>Where the introduction of new technologies results in a high risk to your Personal Data, We will perform a data protection impact assessment and will only proceed if We are able to mitigate any identified high risks. Methods of collecting Personal Data are reviewed by management before they are implemented to confirm that Personal Data is obtained:</p>
<p>a) fairly, without intimidation or deception, and</p>
<p>b) lawfully, adhering to all relevant rules of law, whether derived from statute or common law, relating to the collection of Personal Data.</p>

<h2 id="120-data-retention">12.0 DATA RETENTION</h2>

<p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes We collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. A copy of Our Data Retention Schedule is available upon request.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which We process your Personal Data and whether We can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law, We have to keep basic information about Our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six tax years plus the current tax year as part of Our legal obligations to do so. In some circumstances, you can ask Us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, We may anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case We may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h3 id="data-disposal">DATA DISPOSAL</h3>
<p>Once the data retention periods above expire, digital records are permanently destroyed or fully anonymised if retained for statistical or research purposes. In this case, all personal identifiers are removed permanently so individuals cannot be identified.</p>
<h2 id="130-your-legal-rights">13.0 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Under certain global Data Protection Laws (including UK and EU Data Protection Laws) and under certain circumstances, you have rights in relation to your Personal Data. We set out below a brief description of such rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To be informed</strong> : Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their Personal Data. This is a key transparency requirement under UK and EU Data Protection Laws. This privacy policy and Our cookie policy meet this requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Request access to your Personal Data</strong> (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;): This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data We hold about you subject to certain exemptions.</li>
<li><strong>Request rectification of your Personal Data</strong> : This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data We hold about you corrected, though We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide.</li>
<li><strong>Request erasure of your Personal Data</strong> : This enables you to ask Us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for Us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask Us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where We may have processed your Personal Data unlawfully or where We have a legal obligation to erase your Personal Data. Note, however, that the right to request erasure is not absolute, and there are circumstances where We do not need to comply with the request, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
<li><strong>Object to processing of your Personal Data</strong> : This enables you to object to processing where We are relying on Our Legitimate Interest (or those of a third party) to process your Personal Data or where We are processing your Personal Data for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes. We do not need to stop processing if We can give strong and legitimate reasons to continue processing your Personal Data. You also have the right to object where We are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right but does not automatically mean that We need to erase all of your Personal Data, and in particular, We may put your details on a suppression list to ensure We don&#39;t send you direct marketing in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Request restriction of processing your Personal Data</strong> : This enables you to ask Us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in certain scenarios, including (a) if you want Us to establish the data&#39;s accuracy; or (b) you have objected to Our use of your data, but We need to verify whether We have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or a third party</strong> : We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to Personal Data you have provided to Us, which you initially provided consent for Us to use or where We used the Personal Data to perform, or take steps prior to performing, a contract with you and where the processing is automated.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time where We are relying on consent to process your Personal Data</strong> : However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, We may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case when you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the above rights are not all absolute and are subject to applicable Data Protection Laws and may be subject to conditions and provisions set out in applicable Data Protection Laws. For further information or if you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please get in touch with Us.</p>
<h3 id="no-fee-is-usually-required">NO FEE IS USUALLY REQUIRED</h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, We may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, We may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-may-need-from-you">WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help Us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up Our response.</p>
<h3 id="time-limit-to-respond">TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take Us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, in which case We will inform you of an extension period of up to 2 months. In this case, We will keep you informed on progress.</p>
