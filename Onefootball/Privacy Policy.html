            Your personal data may also be transferred by Meta, Google and Apple
            to the USA and processed there. Meta Platforms Inc. and Google LLC
            have joined the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which is why the
            transfer in this case is based on the adequacy decision for the USA
            in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR. Apple is obliged by standard
            contractual clauses to comply with the level of data protection in
            the EU.

          <p>2.3.1 Use without registration</p>
          <p>
            You can also use essential functions of our platform without
            registering. However, the use of these basic functionalities, such
            as specifying a favourite team and tracking clubs, leagues,
            associations and players, as well as displaying football results and
            content, requires the processing of personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to be able to use the basic functionalities, we generate a
            device-specific identification number (pseudonym) when the website
            is opened for the first time. Information such as the operating
            system, IP address and server request time is also processed for the
            technical display of content. The IP addresses are deleted or
            anonymised after processing, whereby the location is only determined
            up to the geographical level of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data in the technical logs is analysed anonymously in order to
            improve our platform and correct possible errors. The data
            processing is based on our legitimate interest in accordance with
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR to display your content based on your
            interests (namely clubs, leagues, associations and players).

          <p><strong>2.4 Orders</strong></p>
          <p>
            During an order process (e.g. pay-per-view), we collect the
            mandatory data required for contract processing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Salutation;</p></li>
            <li><p>First name and surname;</p></li>
            <li><p>Date of birth;</p></li>
            <li><p>E-mail address;</p></li>
            <li><p>Invoice address;</p></li>
            <li><p>Payment information (e.g. IBAN, credit card, etc.);</p></li>
            <li><p>Telephone number</p></li>
            <li><p>GPS data, if applicable</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>
          <p><strong>2.5 Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p>
            You have the option of subscribing to our newsletter, in which we
            regularly inform you about new products and promotions.
          </p>
          <p>2.5.1 Subscribe to the newsletter</p>
          <p>
            We use the so-called double opt-in procedure to subscribe to our
            newsletter, i.e. we will only send you newsletters by e-mail if you
            confirm in our notification e-mail by clicking on a link that you
            are the owner of the e-mail address provided. If you confirm your
            e-mail address, we will store your e-mail address, the time of
            registration and the IP address used for registration until you
            unsubscribe from the newsletter. The sole purpose of this storage is
            to send you the newsletter and to be able to prove your
            registration. In addition, we measure whether our newsletter can be
            delivered at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for processing is your consent in accordance with
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any
            time with effect for the future by unsubscribing from the
            newsletter. A corresponding unsubscribe link can be found in every
            newsletter. A message to the contact details given above or in the
            newsletter (e.g. by e-mail or letter) is of course also sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>2.5.2 Newsletter tracking</p>
          <p>
            We want to share content that is as relevant as possible for our
            users via our newsletter and better understand what you are actually
            interested in. We therefore use standard market technologies in our
            newsletters to measure interactions with the newsletters (e.g.
            opening of the email, links clicked on). We use this data in
            pseudonymous form for general statistical evaluations and to
            optimise and further develop our content and customer communication.
            On the one hand, this is done with the help of small graphics
            embedded in the newsletter (so-called pixels), which establish a
            connection to the server of the images when the e-mail is opened. On
            the other hand, we use links where we first register a click on this
            link and only then forward it to the desired target page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for this is your consent in accordance with Art. 6
            para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The information in the end device is then
            accessed on the basis of the implementation laws of the ePrivacy
            Directive of the EU member states, in Germany according to § 25
            para. 1 TTDSG. You can revoke your consent to the analysis of user
            behaviour at any time with effect for the future by unsubscribing
            from the newsletter. You can also prevent the measurement of the
            opening of an email by deactivating graphics or the output of HTML
            content in your email programme by default.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data on the interaction with our newsletters is stored
            pseudonymously for 90 days and then completely anonymised.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2.6 Existing customer acquisition by e-mail</strong></p>
          <p>
            If you register with us or make a purchase from us, we will also use
            your contact details to send you further information about our
            products and services that is relevant to you by email ("existing
            customer advertising"). This may include, in particular, news,
            promotions and offers as well as feedback and other surveys.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
            GDPR in conjunction with Section 7 para. 3 UWG, according to which
            data processing is permitted to safeguard legitimate interests,
            insofar as this concerns the storage and further use of data for
            advertising purposes. You can object to the use of your data for
            advertising purposes at any time by clicking on the corresponding
            link in the emails or by sending a message to the contact details
            given above (e.g. by email or letter) without incurring any costs
            other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2.7 Surveys</strong></p>
          <p>
            You have the opportunity to take part in one of our surveys. We use
            the results of these surveys to improve our service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for data processing when participating in the survey
            is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. We
            base the sending of the surveys on your consent in accordance with
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, provided that you have given us this
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can object to the sending of a satisfaction survey and the use
            of your data for advertising purposes at any time by clicking on the
            corresponding link in the e-mails or by sending a message to the
            above-mentioned contact details (e.g. by e-mail or letter) or revoke
            your consent with effect for the future without incurring any costs
            other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.

          <p><strong>2.8 Competitions</strong></p>
          <p>You have the opportunity to take part in our competitions.</p>
          <p>
            In the context of competitions, we use your data for the purpose of
            organising the competition and notifying you of the prize. Detailed
            information can be found in the conditions of participation for the
            respective competition. The legal basis for processing is the
            competition contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
            Data processing for other or further purposes, in particular for
            advertising, is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6
            para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            We base the sending of the offer to participate in the competition
            on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR,
            provided you have given us this consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can object to the sending of an offer to participate in
            competitions and the use of your data for advertising purposes at
            any time by clicking on the corresponding link in the emails or by
            sending a message to the above-mentioned contact details (e.g. by
            email or letter) or revoke your consent with effect for the future
            without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs
            according to the basic rates.

          <p>
            This website uses various services and applications (collectively
            "tools") that are offered either by us or by third parties. These
            include, in particular, tools that use technologies to store or
            access information in the end device:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Cookies: Information stored on the end device, consisting in
                particular of a name, a value, the storing domain and an expiry
                date. So-called session cookies (e.g. PHPSESSID) are deleted
                after the session, while so-called persistent cookies are
                deleted after the specified expiry date. Cookies can also be
                removed manually.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Web storage (local storage / session storage): Information
                stored on the end device, consisting of a name and a value.
                Information in session storage is deleted after the session,
                while information in local storage has no expiry date and
                remains stored unless a mechanism for deletion has been set up
                (e.g. storage of a local storage with a time entry). Information
                in local and session storage can also be deleted manually.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                JavaScript: programming codes (scripts) embedded or called up in
                the website that, for example, set cookies and web storage or
                actively collect information from the end device or about the
                user behaviour of visitors. JavaScript may be used for "active
                fingerprinting" and the creation of user profiles. JavaScript
                can be blocked by a setting in the browser, although most
                services will then no longer work.

              <p>
                Pixel: A tiny graphic automatically loaded by a service that can
                make it possible to recognise visitors by automatically
                transmitting the usual connection data (in particular IP
                address, information about the browser, operating system,
                language, address called up and time of the call) and, for
                example, to determine whether an email has been opened or a
                website visited. With the help of pixels, "passive
                fingerprinting" and the creation of user profiles can be carried
                out. The use of pixels can be prevented, for example, by
                blocking images, such as in emails, although the display is then
                severely restricted.

                TC-String: For providers participating in the Transparency and
                Consent Framework ("TCF") of the Interactive Advertising Bureau
                ("IAB"), user preferences recorded in a content management
                platform are coded and stored in a sequence of letters and
                numbers, the so-called Transparency and Consent String
                ("TC-String"). Providers can use this TC string to display
                targeted advertising to users.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With the help of these technologies and also by simply establishing
            a connection on a page, it may be possible to create so-called
            "fingerprints", i.e. user profiles that do not require the use of
            cookies or web storage but can still recognise visitors.
            Fingerprints based on the connection setup cannot be completely
            prevented manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most browsers are set by default to accept cookies, the execution of
            scripts and the display of graphics. However, you can usually adjust
            your browser settings so that all or certain cookies are rejected or
            scripts and graphics are blocked. If you completely block the
            storage of cookies, the display of graphics and the execution of
            scripts, our services may not work or may not work properly.

          <p>
            In the following, the tools we use are listed according to category,
            whereby we inform you in particular about the providers of the
            tools, the storage duration of cookies or information in local
            storage and session storage as well as the transfer of data to third
            parties. We also explain in which cases we obtain your voluntary
            consent to use the tools and how you can withdraw this consent.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3.2 Legal basis and cancellation</strong></p>
          <p>3.2.1 Legal basis</p>
          <p>
            We use tools necessary for website operation on the basis of our
            legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in order
            to provide the basic functions of our website. In certain cases,
            these tools may also be necessary for the fulfilment of a contract
            or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, in which case
            the processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
            b GDPR. Access to and storage of information in the end device is
            absolutely necessary in these cases and is carried out on the basis
            of the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU
            member states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 2 TTDSG.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use all other non-essential (optional) tools that provide
            additional functions on the basis of your consent in accordance with
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. These include, for example, tools that
            are used to recognise users and to statistically record and analyse
            general user behaviour on this and other websites. With the help of
            these tools, we can understand usage habits and adapt and optimise
            this website. They also include, for example, tools that are used to
            create user profiles about user behaviour and the advertisements and
            content viewed or clicked on by users. This enables classification
            into advertising categories, the display of personalised advertising
            and content on this and other websites and retargeting with
            advertising on other websites. The access to and storage of
            information in the end device then takes place on the basis of the
            implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member
            states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Data processing
            using these tools only takes place if we have received your consent
            for this in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If personal data is transferred to third countries, we refer, also
            with regard to any associated risks, to Section 6 ("Data transfer to
            third countries"). We will inform you if an adequacy decision exists
            for the third country in question or if standard contractual clauses
            or other guarantees have been concluded for the use of certain
            tools. If you have given your consent to the use of certain tools
            and the associated transfer of your personal data to third
            countries, we will (also) transfer the data processed when using the
            tools to third countries on the basis of this consent in accordance
            with Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>3.2.2 Obtaining your consent</p>
          <p>
            To obtain and manage your consent, we use the consent management
            platform ("CMP") tool OneTrust from OneTrust, LLC, 1200 Abernathy
            Rd, Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia 30328 ("OneTrust"). This generates a
            banner that informs you about the data processing on our website and
            gives you the opportunity to consent to all, individual or no data
            processing using optional tools. This banner appears when you visit
            our website and when you call up the selection of your settings
            again in order to change them or revoke your consent. The banner
            will also appear on subsequent visits to our website if you have
            deactivated the storage of cookies or if the cookies or information
            in the local storage have been deleted or have expired.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of your website visit, your consent or revocation, your IP
            address, information about your browser, your device and the time of
            your visit are transmitted to OneTrust. In addition, necessary
            information is stored on your device to document your consents and
            revocations ("Cookielaw by OneTrust (formerly Optanaon)").
          </p>
          <p>
            Data processing is necessary to provide you with the legally
            required consent management and to fulfil our documentation
            obligations. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR,
            justified by our interest in fulfilling the legal requirements for
            consent management. Access to and storage of information in the end
            device is absolutely necessary in these cases and is carried out on
            the basis of the implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of
            the EU member states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 2 TTDSG.
          </p>
          <p>3.2.3 Revoking your consent or changing your selection</p>

          <p><strong>3.3 IAB Transparency and Consent Framework</strong></p>
          <p>
            When using OneTrust, the current version of the IAB Transparency and
            Consent Framework ("TCF") standard is observed, which specifies
            conclusive categories of processing purposes and the associated
            legal bases. TCF also enables your decisions made in the CMP, such
            as consents, revocations and objections, to be forwarded directly to
            the providers of the technologies in the CMP. The so-called TC
            string is used for this purpose. This ensures that your current
            request is always honoured and complied with by the providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following user data is transmitted to OneTrust as part of the
            website visit: Consents, revocations and objections, IP address,
            information about the browser, end device and the time of the visit.

          <p><strong>3.4 Necessary tools</strong></p>
          <p>
            We use certain tools to enable the basic functions of our website
            ("necessary tools"). These include, for example, tools to prepare
            and display website content, to manage and integrate tools, to
            provide payment processing services, to detect and prevent fraud and
            to ensure the security of our website. Without these tools, we would
            not be able to provide our service. Therefore, necessary tools are
            used without consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for necessary tools is the necessity to fulfil our
            legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the
            provision of the respective basic functions and the operation of our
            website. In cases where the provision of the respective website
            functions is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or for the
            implementation of pre-contractual measures, the legal basis for data
            processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Access to and storage of
            information in the end device is absolutely necessary in these cases
            and is carried out on the basis of the implementation laws of the
            ePrivacy Directive of the EU member states, in Germany according to
            § 25 para. 2 TTDSG.
          </p>
          <p>3.4.1 Own tools</p>
          <p>
            We use our own necessary tools that access information in the end
            device or store information on the end device, in particular
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>for login authentication,</p></li>
            <li><p>for load distribution,</p></li>
            <li><p>to save your language settings,</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                to note that information placed on our website has been
                displayed to you - so that it will not be displayed again the
                next time you visit the website.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3.5 Functional tools</strong></p>
          <p>
            We also use optional tools to improve the user experience on our
            website and to offer you more functions ("functional tools").
            Although these are not absolutely necessary for the basic functions
            of the website, they can bring considerable benefits to visitors,
            particularly in terms of user-friendliness and the provision of
            additional communication, display or payment channels. This can
            include, in particular, the integration of external content such as
            maps and videos as well as logging in via an existing social network
            account or, for example, a comment function.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the functional tools is your consent in
            accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Access to and storage of
            information in the end device then takes place on the basis of the
            implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member
            states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. To revoke your
            consent, see 3.2.3: "Revoking your consent or changing your
            selection".
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that personal data is transferred to third countries,
            in addition to the information provided below, we refer to Section 6
            ("Data transfer to third countries").
          </p>
          <p><strong>3.6 Analysis tools</strong></p>
          <p>
            In order to improve our website, we use optional tools to recognise
            visitors and to statistically record and analyse general user
            behaviour based on access data ("analysis tools"). We also use
            analysis services to evaluate the use of our various marketing
            channels. The usage information collected is analysed and enables us
            to understand the usage habits of our visitors. This helps us to
            adapt and optimise the design of our website and make the user
            experience more pleasant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the analysis tools is your consent in accordance
            with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Access to and storage of
            information in the end device then takes place on the basis of the
            implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member
            states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. To revoke your
            consent, see 3.2.3: "Revoking your consent or changing your
            selection".
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that personal data is transferred to third countries,
            in addition to the information provided below, we refer to Section 6
            ("Data transfer to third countries").
          </p>
          <p><strong>3.7 Marketing tools</strong></p>
          <p>
            We also use optional tools for advertising purposes ("marketing
            tools"). Some of the access data collected when you use our website
            is used to create usage profiles, which in particular store your
            usage behaviour, the advertisements you have viewed or clicked on
            and, based on this, the classification into advertising categories,
            interests and preferences. By analysing and evaluating this access
            data, we are able to show you personalised advertising, i.e.
            advertising that corresponds to your actual interests and needs, on
            our website and on the websites and services of other providers. We
            also analyse your usage behaviour in order to recognise you on other
            sites and to address you in a personalised manner based on your use
            of our site (so-called "retargeting"). In addition, we analyse the
            effectiveness and success of our advertising campaigns (in
            particular so-called "conversions" and leads).
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketing tools also include optional social network tools that are
            used to share posts and content via these networks ("social media
            plugins").
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the marketing tools is your consent in
            accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Access to and storage of
            information in the end device then takes place on the basis of the
            implementation laws of the ePrivacy Directive of the EU member
            states, in Germany according to § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. To revoke your
            consent, see 3.2.3: "Revoking your consent or changing your
            selection".
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that personal data is transferred to third countries,
            in addition to the information provided below, we refer to Section 6
            ("Data transfer to third countries").
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following section, we would like to explain the tools and the
            providers used for this in more detail. The data collected may
            include in particular
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>the IP address of the device;</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the information of a cookie and in local or session storage;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the device identifier of mobile devices (e.g. device ID,
                advertising ID);
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Referrer URL (previously visited page);</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Pages accessed (date, time, URL, title, duration of visit);</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Downloaded files;</p></li>
            <li><p>Clicked links to other websites;</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>If applicable, achievement of certain goals (conversions);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Technical information: Operating system; browser type, version
                and language;
              </p>
              <p>device type, make, model and resolution;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Approximate location (country and city if applicable).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, the data collected is only stored under a pseudonym, so
            that no direct conclusions can be drawn about individuals.

          <p><strong>3.8 Processing purposes, functions and service providers</strong></p>
          <p>
            Processing purposes and functions, as well as the individual
            providers ("suppliers") can be viewed in the CMP under the following
            link under "Data protection settings"

            <li><strong>Online presence in social networks</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We maintain an online presence on social networks in order to
            communicate with customers and interested parties and to provide
            information about our products and services. User data is generally
            processed by the relevant social networks for market research and
            advertising purposes. This allows user profiles to be created based
            on the interests of users. Cookies and other identifiers are stored
            on the computers of the data subjects for this purpose. These user
            profiles are then used, for example, to display adverts within the
            social networks as well as on third-party websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the operation of our online presences, we may have access
            to information such as statistics on the use of our online presences
            provided by the social networks. These statistics are aggregated and
            may contain, in particular, demographic information (e.g. age,
            gender, region, country) and data on interaction with our online
            presence (e.g. likes, subscriptions, sharing, viewing images and
            videos) and the posts and content distributedvia it. This may also
            provide information about the interests of users and which content
            and topics are particularly relevant to them. This information can
            also be used by us to adapt the design and our activities and
            content on the online presence and to optimise it for our audience.
            Please refer to the list below for details and links to the social
            network data that we can access as the operator of the online
            presence. The collection and use of these statistics are generally
            subject to joint responsibility. Where this applies, the relevant
            contract is listed below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR,
            based on our legitimate interest in effective information and
            communication with users, or Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, in order to
            stay in contact with our customers and inform them and to carry out
            pre- contractual measures with interested parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an account with the social network, it is possible that
            we can see your publicly available information and media when we
            access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to
            contact you. This can be done, for example, via direct messages or
            posts. The content of communication via the social network and the
            processing of content data is the responsibility of the social
            network as a messenger and platform service. As soon as we transfer
            personal data from you to our own systems or process it further, we
            are independently responsible for this and this is done to carry out
            pre-contractual measures and to fulfil a contract in accordance with
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the data processing carried out by the social
            networks on their own responsibility can be found in the data
            protection information of the respective social network. The links
            below will also provide you with further information on the
            respective data processing and the options to object.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to point out that data protection requests can be made
            most efficiently with the respective provider of the social network,
            as only these providers have access to the data and can take
            appropriate measures directly. You can also contact us with your
            request. In this case, we will process your enquiry and forward it
            to the provider of the social network.

            Some of the data processing may be carried out by our service

            store our website and databases, software providers, IT service
            providers that maintain our systems, agencies, market research
            companies, group companies and consulting firms. If we pass on data
            to our service providers, they may only use the data to fulfil their
            tasks. The service providers have been carefully selected and
            commissioned by us. They are contractually bound by our
            instructions, have suitable technical and organisational measures in
            place to protect the rights of the data subjects and are regularly
            monitored by us.

            <li><strong>Data transfer to third countries</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            As explained in this privacy policy, we use services whose providers
            are partly located in so-called third countries (outside the
            European Union or the European Economic Area) or process personal
            data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not
            correspond to that of the European Union. If this is the case and
            the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for
            these countries (Art. 45 GDPR), we have taken appropriate
            precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any
            data transfers. These include the standard contractual clauses of
            the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where this is not possible, we base the transfer of data on
            exceptions under Art. 49 GDPR, in particular your express consent or
            the necessity of the transfer for the fulfilment of the contract or
            for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a transfer to a third country is planned and there is no adequacy
            decision or suitable guarantees, it is possible and there is a risk
            that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. secret
            services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to
            collect and analyse it, and that the enforceability of your data
            subject rights cannot be guaranteed. If you obtain your consent via
            the consent banner, you will also be informed of this.

            <li><strong>Storage duration</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In principle, we only store personal data for as long as necessary
            to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the data. We then
            delete the data immediately, unless we still need the data until the
            statutory limitation period expires for evidence purposes for civil
            law claims, due to statutory retention obligations or there is
            another legal basis under data protection law for the continued
            processing of your data in the specific individual case.
          </p>
          <p>
            For evidence purposes, we must retain contract data in particular
            for three years from the end of the year in which the business
            relationship with you ends. Any claims expire at the earliest at
            this time in accordance with the statutory limitation period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even after this, we still have to store some of your data for
            accounting reasons. We are obliged to do so due to statutory
            documentation obligations that may arise from the German Commercial
            Code, the German Fiscal Code, the German Banking Act, the German
            Money Laundering Act and the German Securities Trading Act. The
            periods specified there for the retention of documents are two to
            ten years.

            To assert your rights described here, you can contact us at any time
            using the contact details above. This also applies if you wish to
            receive copies of guarantees to demonstrate an adequate level of
            data protection. If the relevant legal requirements are met, we will
            comply with your data protection request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your requests to assert data protection rights and our responses to
            them will be stored for documentation purposes for a period of up to
            three years and, in individual cases, beyond this period if there
            are grounds for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
            The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, based on our interest
            in the defence against any civil law claims pursuant to Art. 82
            GDPR, the avoidance of fines pursuant to Art. 83 GDPR and the
            fulfilment of our accountability obligation pursuant to Art. 5 para.
            2 GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. As a
            result, we will no longer continue the data processing that was
            based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent does
            not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
            withdrawal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we process your data on the basis of legitimate interests, you
            have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time
            on grounds relating to your particular situation. If it concerns an
            objection to data processing for direct marketing purposes, you have
            a general right to object, which we will also implement without you
            having to give reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation or objection,
            simply send an informal message to the contact details above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data
            protection supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR at.
            You can assert this right, for example, with a supervisory authority
            in the Member State of your place of residence, your place of work
            or the place of the alleged infringement. In Berlin, where we are
            based, the competent supervisory authority is Berlin Commissioner
            for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Alt-Moabit 59-61,
            10555 Berlin.
