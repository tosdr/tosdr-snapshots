<p><strong>b. Consumer Report Notice</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, insurance agents, insurers, and Insurance Services may need to obtain additional background information about you. For example, consumer reports (including credit reports) may be ordered in connection with your insurance application. These reports provide information that may assist in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewals, or extensions of insurance. Insurance companies may also obtain and use a credit-based insurance score based on information contained in your consumer report. Insurance agents, insurers, and Insurance Services may use a third-party service provider in connection with the development of your insurance score and rate quote.

<p id="cookies-and-technologies"><strong>c. Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as saving your preferences from visit to visit to present you with a customized version of the Site. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>
<p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies. These Cookies are required for the operation of our Sites (for example, to enable you to log into secure areas of our website or use a shopping cart). These Cookies enable you to move around the Sites and use their features. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Sites’ performance and may make the features and service unavailable.</li>
<li>Session Cookies: Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from page to page within the Site and are typically deleted once you close your browser.</li>
<li>Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies reside on your system and allow us to customize your experience if you leave and later return to the Site/Services. For example, persistent cookies may allow us to remember your preferences.</li>
<li>Analytics and Customization Cookies: Analytics cookies help us understand how our Site is working and who is visiting our Site. We may use these types of Cookies to ensure that visitors can easily find the information they are looking for on our websites. Google Analytics is one tool we use and you can learn more by reviewing Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?fg=1">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
<li>Functionality Cookies: These Cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>
<li>Advertising Cookies: These Cookies record your online activities, including your visits to our Sites, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked. One purpose of this is to help make the content displayed on our Sites more relevant to you. Another purpose is to allow us and our service providers to deliver advertisements or other communications to you that are designed to be more relevant to your apparent interests. When we and our service providers do so, this also involves partners such as publishers, data management platforms, and demand-side platforms that help to manage the data. For example, if you look at one page on one of our Sites, we may cause an advertisement to be delivered to you, on our Sites, or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We and our service providers and partners may also append other data to information collected by these Cookies, including information obtained from third parties, and share this information with third parties for the purpose of delivering ads to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may use cookies to collect Personal Information, Usage Data, or both.</p>
<p>Some cookies may be placed by third parties such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Personal Information collected by third-party cookies is governed by each third-party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>Your acceptance of cookies is not required for visiting our website.</p>
<p>Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically. If you do not wish this to be so, you may set up your browser so that it will inform you about the setting of cookies so that you may permit this only in individual cases; or that you refuse to accept cookies for certain cases or on a general basis; or that you activate the automatic deletion of the cookies when you close the browser. In addition, you may at any time delete cookies that have already been set by using an internet browser or other software programs.</p>
<p>Many devices and browsers give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. To assist you, we compiled directions for some commonly used browsers and devices in the table below. Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods described below may not work for your browser, browser version, or device and may change at any time. We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser.</p>
<p>Before you dive in, please note, if you opt out of the collection and use of information via cookies and other tracking technologies, you may still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks from which you have not opted out. In addition, your opt-out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make such choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our websites and webforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disabling Cookies in Browsers.</strong>&nbsp;When you elect to opt-out on a website, including our websites, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same website, the opt-out cookie tells the website you opted out. This means that blocking all cookies may then prevent the websites from operating as expected and may also prevent your consent choices from being stored. This may mean that if you opt-out and then block cookies, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your opt-out. You should also be aware that blocking cookies on your computer will not affect your consent choices on a different device, such as a mobile device. You may want to keep this in mind when determining your browser cookie settings. For more information on how to disable cookies on the most common browsers see below.</li>

<p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong>&nbsp;Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals (go here to learn more). Web browsers may incorporate or activate these features differently, making it unclear if users have consciously activated them. As a result, we do not take steps to respond to such signals.</p>
<p><strong>d. Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you ads or other content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. We try to retain and analyze data in a way that anonymizes it, but it is possible that we may collect or use Personal Information as part of our online behavioral advertising activities. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information by an Advertiser. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or on third-party websites. You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.networkadvertising.org&nbsp;</a>or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org&nbsp;</a>to learn more about Internet advertising companies and how to opt out of their information collection.</p>
<p><strong>e. Information from Advertisements and Insurance Services</strong></p>
<p>If you arrive at the Site via an advertisement (e.g., banner ad) or an Insurance Service, we may collect information regarding the advertisement or Insurance Service with which you interacted and your interactions (e.g., item clicked, date and time)</p>
<p><strong>f. Tracking Pixels and Clear GIFs</strong></p>
<p>We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a user's visit to the Site. This technology helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with the Site, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) "tracking pixels" and (2) "clear gifs." Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user's session, such as IP addresses and the type of browser used, and Personal Information, if provided by the user.</p>
<p>If you arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Site to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites, and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>g. Google Analytics Advertising Features</strong></p>
<p>We utilize certain Google Analytics tools to improve the Site experience for our users, but also to aggregate the characteristics and browsing habits of our users, on an anonymized basis, to provide products and services that are more tailored to our users.</p>
<p><strong>h. Social Media Widgets</strong></p>
<p>The Site may include social media features, such as the Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and the pages you visit on our Site as well as other Personal Information. A cookie may be set to ensure that a feature properly functions. Your interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>

<p><strong>e. Non-Discrimination Notice</strong></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA or this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>f. California “Do Not Track” Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Do Not Track is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting that a user’s activity not be tracked. At this time, our Site and Services do not respond to “do not track” signals.</p>
<p><strong>g. California Site Ownership Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California residents are entitled to the following information: The provider of the Site is SmartFinancial.com Insurance LLC, 4041 MacArthur Blvd, Suite 210, Newport Beach, CA. 92660. To file a complaint regarding the Site or to receive further information about the Site, please contact us. You may also contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834 or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
<p><strong>h. Right to Non-Discrimination</strong></p>
<p>Should you wish to exercise your rights as a resident of California, we will not discriminate against you by showing you different products or services based solely upon your request. Kindly note, however, if the advertisers require additional data or information from you before providing quotes, rates, or other information, exercising your California rights may limit the number and range of advertisers who are displayed in response to your request.</p>
<p><strong>i. Do Not Sell My Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Some of our sharing activities may be a “sale” of personal information under California law. For example, when we share information we collected automatically from you with advertisers in order to create consumer profiles and present our advertisers’ products and services to you. Subject to certain exceptions, as a California resident, you may opt-out of the “sale” of your personal information at any time by taking the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>For information collected automatically through cookies and similar tracking technologies change your browser settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. To learn more, read Cookies and Other Technologies.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>j. Shine the Light</strong></p>
<p>California residents may, no more than once per calendar year, request from us information about our disclosure of certain categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To be valid, requests must be submitted to us at in our Privacy Center and select the “Shine the Light Request” option from the drop down menu. We will provide you within 30 days of receiving your request, a list of the categories of personal information (also known as personal data) disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of the third parties.</p>
<p><strong>k. Minors</strong></p>

The CCPA and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act imposes certain requirements on website operators that have actual knowledge that they collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. To make such a request, or if you have any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy for the website or its implementation, please contact us at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:service@SmartFinancial.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">service@SmartFinancial.com</a>.</p>

The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) \"tracking pixels\" and (2) \"clear gifs.\" Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email message.
