                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="data-usage">How we may use your personal information</h2>
            <p>We will only use your personal information as set out in our Privacy Notice.</p>

            <h2 id="voting">Voting</h2>
            <p>You may only vote for a particular server once per day. Voting must be carried out in person on our sites by entering your username and manually completing the Captcha verification. Voting through the use of automated voting scripts, bots or programs is strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>The trading or sale of votes between different servers is strictly forbidden. Players may only be encouraged to vote (whether in-game or otherwise) for the listing of the server from which they have been sent. Encouraging votes from one server to the listing of another server, even if it is owned by the same individual, company or group of companies, is strictly forbidden.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to discount votes or suspend voting if we have reason to suspect that fraudulent voting has occurred or if we consider there has been any attempt to rig the voting.</p>

            <h2 id="server-content">Server Content</h2>
            <p>You are only permitted to add a server our sites if you are the owner of the server or if you have been given explicit permission by the owner. You may only create one listing for the same server, multiple listings will be removed. Once a server has been added you agree that our sites can make regular attempts to gather and store data from your server (players online, version, MOTD etc...) and display this on our sites. As a server owner you agree not to upload any pornographic, illegal, racist or hateful content as part of the server details (banner, name, description etc...).</p>

            <h2 id="banners">Banners</h2>
            <p>Rapidly flashing server banners are forbidden and may result in your server being removed from our sites. Banners may not confuse users into thinking they are part of the site structure, for example by using our assets or imitating site characteristics. Advertisement banners must also adhere to these rules. Judgment on banners and any action taken is entirely at the digression of our staff.</p>

            <h2 id="server-removal">Removal of Servers</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to remove any server at any time with or without prior notice. A server may be removed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>inappropriate server details (banner, name, description etc...)</li>
                <li>abuse of the voting system</li>
                <li>low uptime (servers older than 10 days are automatically removed if the uptime falls below 25%)</li>
                <li>anything other than the exact server name in the name field</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cracked servers of any kind are strictly forbidden and should not be added to our sites. Any cracked servers discovered will be immediately removed.</p>
            <p>In addition, we reserve the right to modify or remove individual server details (banner, name, description etc...) without prior notice when they are deemed inappropriate but not to the extent that warrants a complete removal of the server.</p>

            <h2 id="sponsored-servers">Sponsored Servers</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to change the method by which sponsored slots are allocated from month to month and also the quantity and nature of the slots. By placing a bid during an auction you are agreeing that if your bid is in the top 5 when the auction closes (a winning bid) you will pay the full amount within 48 hours of the auction ending. Payments can be made using PayPal, Bitcoin, Ethereum or bank transfer. You may also be obliged to pay if another server fails to do so (or is deleted) and your bid moves into the top 5 bids. If this situation arises payment is expected within 24 hours of us giving notice. Failure to pay will result in either a ban on taking part in future auctions or the removal of your server from the site. We reserve the right to remove bids at any point during and after the auction provided payment has not been made. Sponsored server slots are non-refundable and are provided 'as-is' with no guarantee of uptime or site traffic included.</p>

            <h2 id="advertisements">Advertisements</h2>
            <p>We display banner advertisements in various sections of our sites. This content is third-party and not endorsed by us in any way. Please see our Privacy Notice for more information.</p>

            <h2 id="uploading-content">Uploading content to our sites</h2>
            <p>Whenever you make use of a feature that allows you to upload content to our sites, or to make contact with other users of our sites, you must comply with the content standards set out in our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>

            <h2 id="rights">Rights you are giving us to use material you upload</h2>
            <p>When you upload or post content to our sites, you grant to us and shall ensure and procure that we are granted a perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty free, transferrable licence, with the right to grant sub-licences, to use, copy, edit, distribute, transmit, store, host, run, play, adapt, publish, re-publish, translate, publicly perform and display, create derivative works from, and do anything else whatsoever with, your content, for any purpose, and in, using, on or through any form, media, medium or technology (whether now known or later developed).</p>
            <p>For example (without limitation), by uploading, posting, or sending a message or other content on our sites, or by adding a server to our sites we may:</p>

                <li>display the same to others through our sites;</li>
                <li>display the same on third party websites and applications, including through embedding, and sub-licence third parties accordingly;</li>
                <li>make regular attempts to gather and store data from your server, including (without limitation) your username, players online, uptime percentage and version.</li>

            <p>You waive all moral rights (including to be identified as author) in relation to your content. You warrant that you have the right to grant the licence above, and that the exercise by us of that licence shall not infringe any copyright or other intellectual property rights in any part of the world.</p>

            <h2 id="aup-interactive-services">Interactive services</h2>
            <p>We may from time to time provide interactive services on our sites, including, without limitation, voting for servers.</p>
            <p>Where we do provide any Interactive Services, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).</p>
            <p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any Interactive Services provided on our sites, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our sites, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any Interactive Service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>
            <p>The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use Interactive Services that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using any Interactive Services should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p>
            <p>Where we do moderate Interactive Services, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>

            <h2 id="aup-content-standards">Content standards</h2>

                <li>Advocate, promote, incite any party to commit, or assist any unlawful or criminal act such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.</li>
