Excel Impact, LLC ("Excel Impact", "agilerates.com", "we" or "us"), is the owner and operator of the agilerates.com website (together with all content, tools and services provided on or in connection with such website, the "Website"). You must be a resident of the United States (including its territorial possessions) and at least eighteen (18) years of age to access and use the Website. By accessing, browsing or using this Website, or any page thereof, through any direct or indirect means, or by using the tools, forms or services offered in or through the Website, you accept and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use and the Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS, A PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF,  AND CONTAINS DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY (Sections 5 and 8). These provisions form an essential basis of our bargain. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and you are to cease accessing or otherwise using the Website. For purposes of this Agreement, "you" or "your" means the person(s) using the Website and/or any tools, forms or services offered in or through the Website. If you are using the Website on behalf of an employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Agreement.</p>

<p>agilerates.com shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Website and the right to modify the terms and conditions applicable to users of the Website, including these Terms of Use, or any part hereof.

<p class="title">2. PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>Please review our <a href="/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement, for detailed information about our policies and practices applicable to the information that is collected through the Website or received directly from you, including the sharing of such information with third parties and its use for advertising and other purposes. By accessing or using the Website, you consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in the Privacy Policy (as it may be changed from time to time, as described more fully in the Privacy Policy).</p>

<p class="title">3. MATCHING TOOLS AND SERVICES</p>

<p>Our Website provides tools and services to help you find insurance coverage or quotes for insurance coverage, all of which are provided by third parties unaffiliated with agilerates.com (collectively, "Insurers"). "Insurers" include insurance companies, agilerates.com's marketing partners, and affiliates or finders working on behalf of insurance companies, with whom we may share your information (as described in our Privacy Policy) for the purpose of enabling you to find affordable insurance coverage. You may be able to access these products and services when you complete a request or submit your zip code or other information and either (i) get matched with potential Insurers who will respond with quotes or conditional offers for products or services, or (ii) get provided with the name and information about potential Insurers who may able to respond with the requested products or services or information about the requested products or services without any quotes or offers. The Insurers that can provide you with insurance quotes or conditional offers may not respond with offers until they obtain additional information from you. You may not be matched with the Insurer making any specific quote or offer.</p>

<p>Although agilerates.com is compensated by its network of Insurers when we display advertisements for their products to you and/or when you respond to a quote or offer for insurance or another product from a Insurer on our Website, agilerates.com is not a provider of insurance, is not acting as an Insurer or broker, and does not make any decisions in connection with the underwriting or offering of any insurance products. Any compensation from Insurers is payment for agilerates.com's services, tools and facilities. Your use of the Website and/or agilerates.com's services constitutes your agreement with this compensation arrangement.</p>

<p>agilerates.com does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular Insurer. Nor is agilerates.com an agent of you or any Insurer. Our services are only administrative. You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available insurance policy or other product, terms and Insurer best suits your needs and financial means. The Insurer is solely responsible for its products and services, and you agree that agilerates.com shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such products or services. You understand that Insurers may keep your insurance request information and any other information provided by agilerates.com or received by them in the processing of your request, whether or not you are qualified for insurance with them or if you obtain insurance from them. You agree to notify any particular Insurer directly if you no longer want to receive communications from them. agilerates.com is not responsible for any errors or delays in responding to a request or referral form caused by, including but not limited to, an incorrect email address provided by you or other technical problems beyond our reasonable control.</p>

<p>The Website and the products and services provided or advertised on the Website may not be available in all states, and the availability of such services and the products offered on the Website may change from to time without notice. Insurers are not attempting to offer insurance outside of their authorized states or country by participating in and offering their products on the Website. Insurers may discontinue, suspend or terminate the offering of any insurance or other product in any specific state through the Website at any time, without prior notice.</p>

<p>The information provided by Excel Impact whether on this website or discussed during any call does not represent a guarantee of coverage or specific payment.  All insurance plans are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the specific policy issued, including, but not limited to, eligibility, pre-certification, exclusions and limitations, and medical necessity requirements. For further information on a policy and its limitations, please call <span class="ringpool"></span>.</p>

<p>The data and other information you may provide agilerates.com is not, and is not treated as, an application for insurance or a request to be pre-approved, pre-qualified or any similar concept. agilerates.com does not guarantee acceptance into any particular insurance program or specific terms or conditions with any Insurer; insurance approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Insurers. Likewise, agilerates.com does not guarantee that the insurance terms or rates offered and made available by Insurers are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. An Insurer's offer may be subject to market conditions, approval and qualification (including review of your driving record). The rates and fees actually provided by Insurers may be higher or lower depending on your complete profile and other considerations used by Insurers, such as your driving record. Unless expressly stated in writing, nothing contained herein shall constitute an offer or promise for an insurance commitment or a rate lock-in agreement. Insurers may not offer all products as well as not offer products in all states. You might not be matched with the Insurer making any specific offer. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, Insurers may obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who applied for or obtain insurance from them. For example, they may ask for your name, Social Security Number or driver's license number, address, date of birth, and other important information, that will allow proper identification of you. During the Insurer application process, they may also ask to see additional information. agilerates.com does not charge you a fee for its service in matching you with Insurers.</p>

<p>By clicking on any button indicating an acceptance or agreement to terms, a continuance of processing, a request for quotes or any other submission ("submission"), you understand that you are agreeing to the stated terms and conditions of that submission and that you are submitting an inquiry as to insurance or another product through agilerates.com to each of the Insurers to whom your request is transmitted.  </p>

<p>You agree that by providing your telephone number in any submission within Excel Impact's webpages that you are providing your signature expressly consenting to receive calls, emails, postal mail, text messages, and other forms of communication from up to eight companies such as <a href="/company-list" target="_blank">listed companies</a> including calls made with an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded voice to the wireless or residential telephone number you provided even if you are on a state or federal Do Not Call registry.  You acknowledge and understand that your wireless carrier may impose charges for these calls or texts and consent to receive communications is not a condition of purchase.  You may revoke your consent at any time.</p>

<p>By including your email in any submission, you are extending an express invitation to each Insurer you have been matched with to contact you by email at any email address you provided (in this case, any such email from an Insurer will not be considered spam or unauthorized by any local, state or federal law or regulation). For any service, you represent that all of the information you have provided in your submission is true and complete.</p>

<p>agilerates.com seeks to provide you multiple insurance quotes through its network of unaffiliated Insurers. By submitting information on an insurance request form or similar form, you authorize us to provide such information to Insurers in order to help you complete your request. Additionally, by submitting a request for insurance, you authorize the Insurers to verify the accuracy and authenticity of all information supplied by you, both internally and with the assistance of unaffiliated third parties.</p>

<p>To determine which Insurers may be matched with you, Insurers provide to us criteria about the type of insurance and the type of customer (for example, state of residence) in which the Insurer is interested. agilerates.com will provide your information to Insurers whose criteria match your profile. Where it is discovered that you do not meet certain Insurers' criteria or you do not qualify for their products, you also authorize us to provide your information to other Insurers whose criteria match your profile and whose products we feel might be of help in completing your request.</p>

<p class="title">8. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</p>

<p>You and we each agree that any and all disputes or claims that relate to or arise from your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate section (this "Agreement to Arbitrate").</p>

<p class="title">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<p>

<p>You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. &sect; 227 et seq. Unless both you and us agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form if a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect our other users.</p>

<p class="title">Arbitration Procedures<p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.</p>

<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.</p>

<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>

<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

<p>This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate and the closing of your Account or your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services.</p>

<p class="title">Costs of Arbitration<p>

<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>

<p class="title">Confidentiality<p>

<p>The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, vacate or enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties' respective attorneys, tax advisors and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.</p>

<p class="title">Severability<p>

<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>
