<h2>Legal: Copyright and Trademark, Patent, Terms of Service and Privacy Statement</h2><br/>

<h3><a name="copyright"></a>Copyright and Trademark</h3><br/>
<p>The ClustrMaps name, &quot;ClustrMaps&quot;, and the ClustrMaps logo (globe
    with dots framed by a large letter &quot;C&quot;) are Trademarks or Registered
    Trademarks of ClustrMaps Ltd. (see <a href="/contacts">contact page</a> for address details). All work herein is Copyright &copy; ClustrMaps Ltd,
    2005-2024.</p><br/><br/>

<h3><a name="patent"></a>U.S. Patent 7,801,950</h3><br/>
<p>ClustrMaps Ltd. is the holder of US Patent 7,801,950 ("System for analyzing and visualizing access statistics for a web site")
    which protects the fast dot-clustering algorithm and the use of a dual-purpose image (our thumbnail map widget) that both performs
    the visitor tracking and also depicts a faithful representation of visitor locations.</p><br/><br/>

<h3><a name="terms"></a>Terms of Service (&quot;TOS&quot;)</h3><br/>
<p>By clicking on the checkbox labelled &quot;I have read and agree to the
    ClustrMaps Terms of Service&quot; or by clicking a button labelled &quot;Make my map&quot; or &quot;Register&quot; or equivalent
    where provided (annotated with the phrase &quot;<em>Clicking accepts
        Terms & Conditions</em>&quot;), and by using any service, website, HTML
    or JavaScript code of ClustrMaps Ltd. (hereafter &quot;ClustrMaps services&quot;),
    including both free and paid-for services, and/or by placing ClustrMaps
    HTML code on your web site(s) or web page(s), you are agreeing to comply
    with and be bound by the following terms of use. Please review the following
    terms carefully, including this entire web page listed at  <a href="/legal">http://www.clustrmaps.com/legal</a></p>

<p>If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use this site or any
    ClustrMaps services. The term &quot;ClustrMaps&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or
    &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot; refers to ClustrMaps Ltd, the owner of
    the ClustrMaps family of web sites and the ClustrMaps services. The term
    &quot;you&quot; refers to the user or viewer of the ClustrMaps family of
    web sites and the ClustrMaps services.</p><br/><br/>

<p><strong>The ClustrMaps website is available only to individuals who are at least 16 years old</strong></p><br/><br/>

<h3>Description of Service</h3><br/>
<p>ClustrMaps is a combined hit counter, visitor tracker and geographic visualization tool.
    We provide some HTML that you copy into a web page or 'blog sidebar'; the
    HTML includes a link to a thumbnail map image generated by us; when that
    image loads, it increments a counter on the ClustrMaps site and, when the
    map is updated (daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on your traffic) it
    shows the locations of all the visitors to your page since the beginning
    of a specific time interval; clicking on that thumbnail map image reveals
    a larger world map display. </p><br/>
<p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance
    the current Service, including the release of new ClustrMaps properties,
    shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is
    provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and that ClustrMaps assumes no responsibility
    for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user
    communications or personalization settings. </p><br/>
<p>In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet/World
    Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content,
    and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must
    provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet/World
    Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. <br>
</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Terms of Service and Your Obligations</h3>
<p>You agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this Terms of Service
    (&quot;TOS&quot;) with respect to our site (the &quot;Site&quot;). This
    Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between us and you,
    and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations,
    warranties and understandings with respect to the Site, the content, products
    or services provided by or through the Site, and the subject matter of this
    Agreement. </p><br/>
<p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide
    true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted
    by the Service's registration form (such information being the &quot;Registration
    Data&quot;) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to
    keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information
    that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or ClustrMaps has
    reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate,
    not current or incomplete, ClustrMaps has the right to suspend or terminate
    your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service
    (or any portion thereof). </p><br/>
<p>To use the ClustrMaps service, you will be given some HTML code to put
    on the web page(s) you wish to track. The code will show a small 'thumbnail
    map' on your page(s) and you agree to display
    this thumbnail map on your page(s) in a place where a majority of visitors
    can see and notice it, at the very least by scrolling through the page.</p><br/>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that your web site information (name, URL, traffic
    counts, etc.) may be utilized by ClustrMaps to create lists of member sites,
    lists of top sites, and to otherwise promote the service. ClustrMaps retains
    all ownership and all rights to this site content, logo, software, databases,
    reports, and information. ClustrMaps' services are provided &quot;AS IS&quot;.    </p><br/>
<p>We own the data on visitors to your web site that we collect, and we provide
    data to you as a service. You can use the data we provide for any legal
    purposes. We will use the data in compliance with our privacy policy.</p><br/>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that the page(s) on which you have embedded ClustrMaps
    HTML code conform(s) to the following requirements, and that failure to
    conform to these requirements may result in a 'flagging', 'warning' or 'termination'
    process, as described below:</p><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Does not exceed the visit limits expressed in our table of products,
        displayed at <a href="products.htm" target="_blank">http://www.clustrmaps.com/</a>,
        or such other increased limits as shall be mutually agreed between you
        and us. </li>
    <li>Does not knowingly crash browsers.</li>
    <li>Does not falsely generate hits to your page(s).</li>
    <li>Is the same page (URL) as the URL specified when you signed up to your
        ClustrMaps account, in other words that URL points to the page being counted.
        The URL must point to your domain and not to someone else's site. Please
        contact us if you have any special circumstances.</li>
    <li>Does not include or link to software containing viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, or malware.</li>
    <li>Does not infringe the intellectual property, privacy or any other rights of any third party.</li>
    <li>Does not contain anything which is unlawful, abusive, libellous,  defamatory, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, indecent, harassing or threatening.</li>
    <li>Does not promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion,  nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.</li>
    <li>Does not promote or incite violence.</li>
</ul><br/>
<h3>Flagging and Warning</h3><br/>
<p>Failure to conform to the requirements as expressed above may result in
    a graded series of steps by us, including</p><br/>
<ul>
    <li>'flagging' (where we note in our internal database that a potential
        violation, such as exceeded limits, has occurred);</li>
    <li>'warning' (where we send a notification by email and/or alter the thumbnail
        map image as deemed appropriate by us, requesting that the user reconsider
        the requirements and/or upgrade to a larger-scale ClustrMaps service as
        appropriate); or </li>
    <li>'termination' (as specified below). </li>
</ul><br/><br/>
<p>We will make our best endeavours to regard 'visit limit' (excessive counter)
    violations in light of the erratic nature of Internet traffic, and acknowledge
    that isolated 'peaks' may well occur, so will monitor such peaks accordingly
    and consider violations to occur only when the limit has been exceeded consistently
    for a certain consecutive number of days or weeks, as determined by us from
    time to time.<br>
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3><br/>
<p>We reserve the right to remove any site from any of our services at any
    time without notice.</p><br/>
<p>If this agreement is terminated by us or by you for any reason, you agree
    to remove our code from all web pages under your control.</p><br/>
<p>You agree that ClustrMaps, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password,
    account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, and remove and discard
    any Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation,
    for lack of use or if ClustrMaps believes that you have violated or acted
    inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOS. ClustrMaps may also
    in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service,
    or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination
    of your access to the Service under any provision of this TOS may be effected
    without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that ClustrMaps may immediately
    deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files
    in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service.
    Further, you agree that ClustrMaps shall not be liable to you or any third
    party for any termination of your access to the Service. <br>
</p><br/>

<h3>Modification of Terms of Service</h3><br/>
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Service without notice by
    posting the changes at our web sites. You are responsible for regularly
    reviewing these Terms of Service. Continued use of ClustrMaps after any
    such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. ClustrMaps does
    not and will not assume any obligation to notify you of any changes to the
    Terms of Service, but will make our best endeavours as follows: If we make
    a material change to the Terms of Service, we will give You notice by posting
    a message on the ClustrMaps News page, on this Terms of Service page, or
    Your ClustrMaps Admin page stating that there has been a change to the Terms
    of Service and/or by email at the email address you specified when signing
    up to Your ClustrMaps account seven days before such change is scheduled
    to take effect. If You continue to use ClustrMaps after any such changes,
    Your continued use will constitute Your consent to such changes.</p><br/><br/>

<h3><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy statement</h3><br/>
<p><strong>ClustrMaps Ltd</strong>is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and through facilities
    described in the Description of Service above. We will not sell, share, rent, or give away
    such information, above and beyond what is already visible in the public domain through our sites and services, with the possible exception of aggregate information that does not include any personally identifiable information, or such information as may be required to comply with due process of law.
    In cases where such 'due process of law' is involved, we will assess and deal with the
    legal implications and advise any affected users of our services accordingly.</p><br/><br/>

<h3>Use of email addresses</h3><br/>
<p> In order to use this service, a ClustrMaps user must first provide their name and email address,
    in addition the web address ('URL', or Uniform Resource Locator) of the site on which they wish to
    display visitor locations. This information is used by ClustrMaps to send out your first login password,
    and in case we need to contact ClustrMaps users about changes to the Service or to the Terms of
    Service or to provide information updates and news that we may wish to supply from time to time.
    It is not used for any other purpose, and will not be passed on to any others.</p><br/><br/>

<h3>Security</h3><br/><br/>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
    As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ClustrMaps
    can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to
    us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
    We make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Your ClustrMaps
    account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the
    member information relevant to the account. You are responsible for maintaining
    the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign
    out of your ClustrMaps account and close your browser window when you have
    finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal
    information and correspondence. </p><br/><br/>
<h3>Internet tracking</h3><br/>
<p>Like most web servers on the Internet, we also log some information sent
    by your web browser when it requests a web page, including the numerical
    Internet ('IP') address (typically of an internet service provider or hosting
    service rather than an individual user's computer), date and time, and the
    page requested. <i>We also obtain this information from the web browser
        of everyone who visits the web page in which you have embedded a ClustrMaps
        thumbnail image. </i>It is generally impossible for us to identify a user
    from this information. The logs may be analysed from time to time to study
    usage and to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.
    The IP addresses that we obtain from visitors to your site (i.e. the web
    page in which you have embedded a ClustrMaps thumbnail image) is used to
    update our maps on a regular basis, i.e. to put a fresh 'dot on the map'
    for each new visitor to a web site that uses ClustrMaps.</p><br/><br/>
<h3><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>Cookies and third-party  advertising</h3><br/>
<p>A cookie is a piece of  information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web
    browser,  typically to provide historical information (e.g. so you do not have to re-set  preferences
    when you re-visit a site, or to enable an electronic &lsquo;shopping  cart&rsquo; to remember which
    items you have selected when you move to a new page on  a site).&nbsp; To understand the possible
    usage of cookies on ClustrMaps pages,  it is important to distinguish between two kinds of ClustrMaps
    items (thumbnail  (&lsquo;widget&rsquo;) maps vs full web pages, and two kinds of  cookies: (a) 'first-party'
    cookies (in our case, that means cookies provided by  ClustrMaps and originating from our servers at
    clustrmaps.com) vs (b) 'third-party' cookies (provided by others such as  advertisers that you may see
    on certain pages on the ClustrMaps site,  particularly those pages displaying large maps).</p>
<p><br/><br/>
