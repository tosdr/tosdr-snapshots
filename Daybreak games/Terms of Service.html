<h2>Purchases</h2>
<p>Daybreak Games may provide access to various types of game content and services, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Currency</li>
<li>Game Cards</li>
<li>Digital Downloads</li>
<li>Virtual Items</li>
<li>Memberships</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5.1. Virtual Currency.</strong> Virtual Currency is an online redeemable point system that can be used to obtain certain products and services offered by Daybreak through the Daybreak Games. Virtual Currency (a) can be purchased online or in-game, (b) can be acquired by redeeming a Game Card, and (c) may be awarded to end users for free in connection with certain Daybreak promotional offerings. Virtual Currency is sold in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and the location from which you purchase it. We may limit the amount of Virtual Currency that you can purchase or redeem over any given period of time. The purchase or redemption of Virtual Currency may be subject to sales tax in the United Sates. The purchase or redemption of Virtual Currency may be subject to VAT or GST in countries outside the United States. Where applicable, Daybreak will collect the required sales tax, VAT, or GST, and will remit the required amounts to the applicable taxing authority. All sales and redemptions of Virtual Currency are final. Virtual Currency does not expire, however all Virtual Currency is forfeited if your account is terminated or suspended for any reason. We reserve the right to terminate your access to the Virtual Currency in your account if we determine, after investigation, that you have used the Virtual Currency in connection with any fraudulent or illegal activity. Virtual Currency is not legal tender and does not constitute a personal property right. Virtual Currency is nonrefundable, non-transferable, has no cash value, and may not be redeemed, sold, or otherwise transferred for any sum of money or monetary value at any time. Daybreak may offer more than one type of Virtual Currency, for example, Daybreak Cash for its PC games and Marketplace Cash for DC Universe Online on the PlayStation Network. Each type of Virtual Currency is separate and cannot be converted into another Virtual Currency or redeemed in a Daybreak game and/or on a platform that does not use that Virtual Currency.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. Game Cards.</strong> Daybreak Game Cards may be purchased from various retailers. Game Cards can be redeemed for membership time and/or Virtual Currency as stated on the front of each card. The use of a Game Card is subject to these Daybreak Terms of Service and the terms and conditions printed on the card. While you own the physical Daybreak Game Cards that you purchase, Daybreak Game Cards do not store legal tender, are nonrefundable and non-transferable, have no cash value, and may not be redeemed, sold, or otherwise transferred for any sum of money or monetary value at any time.</p>
<p><strong>5.3. Digital Downloads.</strong> For some Daybreak Games, Daybreak may sell licenses to digital downloads, such as expansion packs, that provide additional gameplay, content, functionality and/or features. Please note that some or all of the gameplay, content, functionality and features in a digital download may be made available at a reduced price, or for free, in a later release of such Daybreak Game. Digital downloads are nonrefundable.</p>
<p><strong>5.4. Virtual Items.</strong> Daybreak sells a variety of virtual items (“<strong>Virtual Items</strong>”), which are digital objects such as in-game coin, armor, weapons, adornments, furniture, pets, mounts, potions, etc. that end users can acquire and use for entertainment purposes in the Daybreak Games. Please note that Virtual Items are not chattel and you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Virtual Items. When you purchase or otherwise acquire any Virtual Item in any Daybreak Game(s), Daybreak is providing you a limited license to use the Virtual Item in such Daybreak Game for personal, non-commercial purposes. Daybreak may sell Virtual Items through an in-game marketplace, a website, and/or a mobile app. Virtual Items may be sold for Virtual Currency or real world money, at Daybreak’s sole and absolute discretion. Please note that not all Virtual Items are available for purchase. Some Virtual Items can be acquired only through gameplay (e.g., by completing quests, killing non-player characters (NPCs), crafting, spending certain points or in-game currency, etc.), or through certain promotions we offer. Daybreak reserves the right to add, modify, remove, suspend and reintroduce Virtual Items in the Daybreak Games, in-game marketplaces, and promotional offers, and to change the prices and/or difficulty of obtaining Virtual Items, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion. Such changes may impact the effectiveness, functionality, and/or commonalty of the Virtual Items. As a result, the perceived value and desirability of a Virtual Item may significantly increase or diminish over time. By purchasing a Virtual Item license you assume the risk of any such changes and agree never to assert any claim against Daybreak based on the actual or perceived value, or change in value, of a Virtual Item. Some Virtual Items may be tradable to other end users as part of the Daybreak Game. However, except as may be expressly permitted by Daybreak in its sole and absolute discretion, selling or otherwise transferring Virtual Items in exchange for real world money or monetary value is not allowed. Virtual Items acquired through the in-game marketplace are nonrefundable, have no cash value and are not redeemable and/or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from us.</p>
<p><strong>5.5. Memberships.</strong> Some Daybreak Games offer membership levels for purchase that provide access to additional content, functionality and features. Some membership levels may require the purchase of a subscription. Subscriptions may be acquired by redeeming a Game Card, by redeeming a “Krono” (only available in some Daybreak Games), or by purchasing a recurring subscription. More information about Krono can be found at <a href="https://www.everquest2.com/krono"><strong>https://www.everquest2.com/krono</strong></a>). Recurring subscriptions will automatically renew for the same amount of time as the initial subscription period, and will be automatically charged to the payment method on your account unless you terminate the auto-renewal before the next renewal date. You can stop the automatic renewal of your subscription at any time by logging into your account and navigating to the membership page. Daybreak reserves the right to change the price and/or to modify the features and content provided by a game subscription at any time in its sole and absolute discretion. We will provide at least ten (10) days’ notice to you before changing subscription pricing. Subscriptions are nonrefundable.</p>

<h2>COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
<p>Daybreak provides many ways for you to communicate with your gaming friends, which may include online forums, in-game text, in-game voice chat, email and messenger-type functionality. All communications that you post or send through any Daybreak Game(s) (“<strong>Communications</strong>”) must comply with our Rules of Conduct (see Section 7 above). If you believe another end user has violated the Rules of Conduct, please contact a Daybreak customer service representative.</p>
<p>All of your Communications in-game and on the Daybreak Websites will pass through and be stored on our servers. You should therefore consider all Communications to be public with no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Daybreak reserves the right, but undertakes no obligation, to monitor, filter, modify, block and/or remove content that does not comply with these Daybreak Terms of Service. Please keep in mind, however, that we cannot control or monitor every Communication between and/or among our end users. You therefore may be exposed to messages or other content created or conveyed by other end users that you find objectionable. You are also responsible for anything you say, print, or otherwise communicate to others through any Daybreak Game(s). Daybreak, as an online service provider, is not responsible for the content (including, without limitation, the accuracy, integrity and/or quality) of your Communications and is not liable for any harm that you or others may cause by communicating through any Daybreak Game(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>SUBMISSIONS</h2>
<p>By posting, transmitting or otherwise submitting any Communication or other message, photograph, artwork, video asset, audio asset, audiovisual asset, or other content, information and/or materials (each, a “<strong>Submission</strong>”) through any Daybreak Game(s), you hereby grant Daybreak a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully-paid up, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform (whether publicly or otherwise), adapt (including, without limitation, the rights to edit, modify, translate, and reformat), create derivative works of, transmit, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise use and exploit (and have others exercise such rights on behalf of Daybreak) any and all Submissions, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, in any media now known or hereafter developed, without compensation or credit. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you also give up any claim that any use by Daybreak of the Submissions violates any of your rights, including but not limited to moral rights, privacy rights, rights to publicity, proprietary or other rights, and/or rights to credit for the material or ideas set forth therein.</p>
<p>For each Submission, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary for you to grant the license granted in this Section 9, and that such Submission, and your provision thereof to and through any Daybreak Game(s) complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You further irrevocably waive any “moral rights” or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials regarding each Submission that you may have under any applicable law under any legal theory as well as any and all other claims that any use of the Submissions by or on behalf of Daybreak violates any of your other rights, including but not limited to, privacy, publicity, proprietary, intellectual property and/or other rights. For purposes of clarity, you retain all other intellectual property rights that you may have in your Submissions, subject to the license and rights granted in this Section 9.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Daybreak Privacy Policy, we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to do any or all of the following, at our sole and absolute discretion: (i) monitor Submissions and all other use thereof; (ii) monitor the play and use any Daybreak Game(s); (iii) alter, remove, or refuse to post or allow to be posted any Submission(s); and/or (iv) disclose any Submission(s) (and the circumstances surrounding their transmission) and any information regarding your use of any Daybreak Game(s) to any third party (including our customers) in order to operate any Daybreak Game(s); to protect Daybreak, our affiliates, our service providers and licensors, and ours and theirs shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, customers and end users; to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests; to enforce the Daybreak Terms Of Service; or to engage in any other business activity. Daybreak will also have the right, subject to the Daybreak Privacy Policy, to extract, compile, synthesize, analyze, use and disclose any Submission(s) (by itself or together with data and information of others) for the purpose of operating any Daybreak Game(s), improving, enhancing and modifying our services and products, providing customized services or technologies to you, developing new services or products, and/or any other lawful business purpose without further disclosure or accounting to you.</p>
<p>Virtual items submitted to Daybreak through the Player Studio program are not governed by this section 9. Rather, they are governed by Section 15 of these Terms of Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>CHEATING</h2>
<p>Maintaining the integrity of the Daybreak Games is extremely important to us. When an end user obtains an unfair advantage by cheating it can ruin the gaming experience for everybody else. You may not disassemble, reverse engineer, or modify any Daybreak Game(s) software in any way. You may not decrypt or modify any data transmitted between the game software and Daybreak’s game servers. You may not develop, share, or use any software, program, macro, or interface that modifies the game play in any way or that gives a user any kind of advantage over other end users, except as expressly authorized by Daybreak. All forms and methods of cheating, including hacks, bots, aimbots, and duping are expressly forbidden. The sale or exchange of accounts, Virtual Items, Virtual Currency, Krono and/or in-game currency for real world money or monetary value is prohibited, except when purchased from Daybreak or otherwise expressly permitted by Daybreak in its sole and absolute discretion. Daybreak reserves the right to suspend or permanently terminate the account of, and restrict access to the Daybreak Games by, any end user that engages in any form of cheating, or that attempts in any way to disable, circumvent, or tamper with any anti-hacking or anti-cheating components or features of any Daybreak Game(s).</p>

<h2>USER GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
<p>Daybreak encourages end users to increase their engagement with the Daybreak Games and share their gaming experiences by creating game-related videos, fan fiction and artwork, Fan Sites (as hereinafter defined) and Apps (as hereinafter defined) for others to view, use and enjoy (collectively, “<strong>User Generated Content</strong>” or “<strong>UGC</strong>”). Your creation and use of UGC must comply with the following guidelines. For purposes of clarity, UGC does not include any virtual items that you create for use within any Daybreak Game(s). Virtual items submitted to Daybreak through the Player Studio program are not governed by this Section 14. Rather, they are governed by Section 15 of these Terms of Service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>14.1. Videos.</strong> Daybreak encourages end users to create videos for their favorite Daybreak Games and share them with others through Fan Sites and video sharing sites like Twitch and YouTube. Videos can include Daybreak Game Content such as screenshots and game play footage, and can be edited anyway you like as long as you comply with the Daybreak Terms of Service. Videos that contain our game content only may be used for non-commercial purposes and may not be licensed or sold. Subject to your compliance with the Daybreak Terms of Service, you may monetize your videos through “partner programs” on sites like Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>14.2. Fan Fiction and Artwork.</strong> We enjoy the creativity of our end users and encourage them to create fan fiction and artwork such as short stories and drawings that are based on and/or inspired by Daybreak Game Content like NPCs, deities, monsters, characters, cities, dungeons, etc. Fan fiction and artwork that contains or is based on Daybreak Game Content only may be used for non-commercial purposes and may not be licensed or sold. We encourage end users to share fan fiction and artwork through Fan Sites, social media, and game forums.</p>
<p><strong>14.3. Fan Sites and Apps.</strong> End users may create websites (“<strong>Fan Sites</strong>”) and mobile apps (“<strong>Apps</strong>”) to communicate with each other and share fan fiction, artwork, videos and information about any Daybreak Game(s). Daybreak may provide Daybreak Game Content for end users to use in creating Fan Sites and Apps. Fan Sites and Apps may also include game data that is acquired via Daybreak’s API, subject to Daybreak’s API Policy. Daybreak’s API Policy is available at <a href="https://census.daybreakgames.com/">https://census.daybreakgames.com/</a>, and is incorporated by reference into the Daybreak Terms of Service. Please note that Daybreak may, in its sole and absolute discretion, modify, revoke access to, or discontinue access to Daybreak’s API, and/or may remove access to any portion of the game data, or all of the game data, at any time without notice. Subject to your compliance with the Daybreak Terms of Service, you may (a) monetize your Fan Sites and Apps by displaying banners and other forms of advertising, (b) charge for premium functionality and content on your Fan Site(s), and (c) charge others to download your App(s). If you intend to charge a subscription or access fee to generate revenue from your Fansite and/or use your UGC for any other commercial purpose not expressly set forth in this Section 14, you first must execute a Fansite license agreement. The limited permission granted in the Daybreak Terms of Service with respect to use of Daybreak Game Content in connection with Fansites does not cover such circumstances. Please contact us if you would like to request a copy of the Fansite license agreement. Fansites that quote an article or message from a Daybreak Website must limit the quote to a paragraph or less and provide a link back to the full article or message. Permission to link from the Fansite to the associated Daybreak Website is granted in such circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>14.4. License Grant and Restrictions.</strong> Subject to your acceptance of and continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of the Daybreak Terms of Service and Daybreak End User License Agreement, during the period of time that you have an account for any Daybreak Game(s) or for a shorter period of time (as determined by Daybreak), Daybreak grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable, non-exclusive right to use Daybreak Game Content to create and distribute UGC as described in this Section 14. Daybreak expressly reserves all other rights in and to the Daybreak Games, including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property therein. Daybreak shall remain the sole and exclusive owner of the Daybreak Games, including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property therein, and your right to create, use and distribute UGC is subject to Daybreak’s ownership rights and the Daybreak Terms of Service and Daybreak End User License Agreement. Nothing in the Daybreak Terms of Service and/or Daybreak End User License Agreement shall be construed as allowing you to use, sell, distribute, license or otherwise exploit any Daybreak Asset or Intellectual Property therein for any other purpose or in any other manner other than as expressly provided in this Section 14. Your use of any Daybreak Game Content in UGC is subject to the usage guidelines that Daybreak may provide for such Daybreak Game Content from time to time. You hereby agree not to (a) remove any trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights notices contained in any Daybreak Asset, (b) challenge Daybreak's or its licensors’ ownership of the Daybreak Game Content and/or the Intellectual property therein, (c) use Daybreak’s name, trademarks, and/or the name of any Daybreak Game(s) in any Fan Site name, domain name or App name, and (d) use or adopt any names and/or trademarks that might be confusingly similar to the trademarks of Daybreak and/or its licensors. UGC must not include any material that is illegal or infringes on the rights of third parties or that is likely to harm the reputation of Daybreak, our affiliates, our service providers and licensors as well as the Daybreak Games. Your use and distribution of UGC must not suggest or imply any sponsorship by, affiliation with and/or endorsement by Daybreak and/or any of its affiliates. The creation and sale of merchandise based in whole or in part on any Daybreak Game(s) is expressly prohibited without Daybreak’s prior written permission. Daybreak reserves the right to require the removal, destruction and/or deletion of any UGC that does not comply with the Daybreak Terms of Service and/or Daybreak End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>Daybreak reserves all right, title and interest in and to the Daybreak Game Content that are not expressly granted in this Section 14. You shall not rent, lease, reproduce, modify, translate or create derivative works of any Daybreak Game Asset(s) except as expressly permitted herein, nor create any derivative works (including, without limitation, fiction or visual art) from, or in any way exploit, any of the characters or content contained in any Daybreak Game(s) without the express written permission of Daybreak. Daybreak does not consent to the protection under the copyright law of any unauthorized derivative work. The creation and sale of merchandise based on any Daybreak Game(s) is expressly prohibited.</p>

<h2>END USER FEEDBACK</h2>
<p>We may ask end users for ideas, suggestions, input, recommendations, information, comments and/or feedback (collectively, “<strong>End User Feedback</strong>”) to help improve the Daybreak Games.

You also may voluntarily provide End User Feedback to us through forums, email, social media sites and/or other means. By providing End User Feedback to Daybreak, whether solicited by Daybreak or not, you hereby grant Daybreak a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free, fully-paid up, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform (whether publicly or otherwise), adapt (including, without limitation, the rights to edit, modify, translate, and reformat), create derivative works of, transmit, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise use and exploit (and have others exercise such rights on behalf of Daybreak) any and all End User Feedback, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, in any media now known or hereafter developed, without compensation or credit.

<h2>CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</h2>
<p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and request that our end users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that materials in any Daybreak Game(s) infringe your copyrighted work, please send a notice to our copyright agent (identified below) with the following information requesting that such materials be removed or access to it blocked: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works incorporated in any Daybreak Game(s) are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Daybreak to locate the material on the applicable Daybreak Game(s); (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Daybreak a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. Such notices and counter-notices should be sent to:</p>
<p>Daybreak Game Company LLC<br />13500 Evening Creek Drive North, Suite 300, San Diego, CA 92128<br />Office of the General Counsel<br />Fax: (858) 239-0852<br />E-mail: gcagent@daybreakgames.com</p>

<h2>GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION</h2>
<p>The validity, construction, interpretation and legal effect of this Daybreak Terms of Service shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the judicial decisions and internal laws of the State of Delaware and the United States of America, without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware and the United States of America. Subject to the below provisions of Section 25, if any Dispute is determined not to be subject to arbitration, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings concerning such Dispute shall be the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Delaware or San Diego County, California, and you and Daybreak each agree to submit and consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>25.1. Introduction.</strong> This Section 25 governs any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Daybreak Terms of Service, Daybreak Games, Daybreak Websites, and any aspect of the relationship between you and Daybreak (each, a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”), including those relating to the formation, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, scope, or applicability of the Terms of Service and the Arbitration Agreement, whether such Dispute arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms of Service, and if not resolved through the Notice of Dispute procedure outlined below.</p>
<p>In the event of a Dispute, you and Daybreak each agree to send the other party a written notice of Dispute stating the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice; the facts giving rise to the Dispute; and the relief requested (“Notice of Dispute”). You must send any Notice of Dispute to disputenotice@daybreakgames.com. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address we have for you, if any. If the Dispute remains unresolved 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received and not before, you or Daybreak may commence an arbitration proceeding in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>All communications, whether oral, written or electronic, exchanged as part of the parties’ efforts to resolve the Notice of Dispute shall be treated as confidential, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the Arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application in accordance with the above provisions of Section 24, or except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the above provisions set forth in Section 24, (i) the Federal Arbitration Act applies to and governs the enforceability of this Section 25, and (ii) all communications, whether oral, written or electronic, in Negotiations shall also be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p><strong>25.2. Mandatory Individual Arbitration &amp; Class Action/Jury Waiver.</strong> <strong>If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute informally, you and Daybreak each agree that all DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR (“Arbitration”) INSTEAD OF IN A COURT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You and Daybreak further agree that the parties are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Daybreak each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation and/or other misuse of intellectual property rights other than patent rights; to prevent the misappropriation and/or other misuse of trade secret and proprietary information; and/or to enforce an Arbitration award.</p>
<p>An Arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written, final decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.</p>
<p>The Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and any supplementary rules and fee schedules then in effect (the “Rules”), as amended by this Daybreak Terms of Service. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</strong></a>. Payment of all filing and administration fees will be governed by the Rules.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or Daybreak that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination shall be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Daybreak Terms of Service and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Daybreak Terms of Service. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Daybreak Terms of Service will preclude you or Daybreak from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you or against you for us, as applicable.</p>

By accessing or using our software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.</p>
<p><strong>26.6. Distribution Partners.</strong> In some countries, Daybreak Games are offered through local partners in those countries. Some Daybreak Games may also be accessed through third party digital distributors, like Valve. These third parties may require you to create an account with them and agree to their terms of service. You will still be responsible for complying with the Daybreak Terms of Service to the extent that you use any Daybreak Game(s).</p>
<p><strong>26.7. Severability.</strong> Each provision of the Daybreak Terms of Service shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of the Daybreak Terms of Service, or a portion thereof, is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision or portion shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>26.8. Waiver.</strong> Any failure of Daybreak to enforce or exercise any right or power under the Daybreak Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of, or a bar to, the exercise of such right or power on any other occasion.</p>
<p><strong>26.9. Filtering.</strong> Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d) as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available at <a href="http://kids.getnetwise.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://kids.getnetwise.org/</a> and <a href="http://onguardonline.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://onguardonline.gov/</a>. Please note that Daybreak does not endorse any of the products or services listed at these sites.</p>
<p><strong>26.10. Miscellaneous.</strong> If any provision of the Daybreak Terms of Service are deemed to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from the Daybreak Terms of Service and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Daybreak Terms of Service does not, and will not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and us. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. The Daybreak Terms of Service, together with all agreements and statements referred to herein and incorporated herein by reference, is the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise provided herein, supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and us relating to such subject matter. Notices to you may be made by posting a notice (or a link to a notice) through any Daybreak Game(s), by email, or by regular mail, at our sole and absolute discretion. Without limitation, you agree that a printed version of the Daybreak Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Daybreak Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Nothing in the Daybreak Terms of Service, express or implied, is intended to or will confer on any person (other than the parties and their respective successors or permitted assigns) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities.</p>
