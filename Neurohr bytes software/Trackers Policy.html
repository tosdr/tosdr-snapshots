Do Not Track Compliance Policy <br />
<br />
Version 1.0<br />
<br />
This domain complies with user opt-outs from tracking via the "Do Not Track"<br />
or "DNT" header  [http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/].  This file will always<br />
be posted via HTTPS at https://example-domain.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt<br />
to indicate this fact.<br />
<br />
SCOPE<br />
<br />
This policy document allows an operator of a Fully Qualified Domain Name<br />
("domain") to declare that it respects Do Not Track as a meaningful privacy<br />
opt-out of tracking, so that privacy-protecting software can better determine<br />
whether to block or anonymize communications with this domain.  This policy is<br />
intended first and foremost to be posted on domains that publish ads, widgets,<br />
images, scripts and other third-party embedded hypertext (for instance on<br />
widgets.example.com), but it can be posted on any domain, including those users<br />
visit directly (such as www.example.com). The policy may be applied to some<br />
domains used by a company, site, or service, and not to others.  Do Not Track<br />
may be sent by any client that uses the HTTP protocol, including websites,<br />
mobile apps, and smart devices like TVs. Do Not Track also works with all<br />
protocols able to read HTTP headers, including SPDY.<br />
<br />
NOTE: This policy contains both Requirements and Exceptions. Where possible<br />
terms are defined in the text, but a few additional definitions are included<br />
at the end.<br />
<br />
REQUIREMENTS<br />
<br />
When this domain receives Web requests from a user who enables DNT by actively<br />
choosing an opt-out setting in their browser or by installing software that is<br />
primarily designed to protect privacy ("DNT User"), we will take the following<br />
measures with respect to those users' data, subject to the Exceptions, also<br />
listed below:  <br />
<br />
1. END USER IDENTIFIERS:         <br />
<br />
  a. If a DNT User has logged in to our service, all user identifiers, such as<br />
     unique or nearly unique cookies, "supercookies" and fingerprints are <br />
     discarded as soon as the HTTP(S) response is issued.                                    <br />
<br />
     Data structures which associate user identifiers with accounts may be<br />
     employed to recognize logged in users per Exception 4 below, but may not<br />
     be associated with records of the user's activities unless otherwise<br />
     excepted.<br />
<br />
  b. If a DNT User is not logged in to our service, we will take steps to ensure <br />
     that no user identifiers are transmitted to us at all.         <br />
<br />
2. LOG RETENTION: <br />
<br />
  a. Logs with DNT Users' identifiers removed (but including IP addresses and<br />
     User Agent strings) may be retained for a period of 10 days or less,<br />
     unless an Exception (below) applies. This period of time balances privacy<br />
     concerns with the need to ensure that log processing systems have time to<br />
     operate; that operations engineers have time to monitor and fix technical<br />
     and performance problems; and that security and data aggregation systems<br />
     have time to operate.<br />
<br />
  b. These logs will not be used for any other purposes.         <br />
<br />
3. OTHER DOMAINS: <br />
<br />
  a. If this domain transfers identifiable user data about DNT Users to<br />
     contractors, affiliates or other parties, or embeds from or posts data to<br />
     other domains, we will either:         <br />
<br />
  b. ensure that the operators of those domains abide by this policy overall<br />
     by posting it at /.well-known/dnt-policy.txt via HTTPS on the domains in<br />
     question,<br />
<br />
    OR<br />
<br />
     ensure that the recipient's policies and practices require the recipient<br />
     to respect the policy for our DNT Users' data.<br />
<br />
    OR  <br />
<br />
     obtain a contractual commitment from the recipient to respect this policy<br />
     for our DNT Users' data.<br />
<br />
    NOTE: if an “Other Domain” does not receive identifiable user information<br />
    from the domain because such information has been removed, because the<br />
    Other Domain does not log that information, or for some other reason, these<br />
    requirements do not apply.<br />
<br />
  c. "Identifiable" means any records which are not Anonymized or otherwise<br />
     covered by the Exceptions below.<br />
<br />
4. PERIODIC REASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE: <br />
<br />
  At least once every 12 months, we will take reasonable steps commensurate<br />
  with the size of our organization and the nature of our service to confirm<br />
  our ongoing compliance with this document, and we will publicly reassert our<br />
  compliance.<br />
<br />
5. USER NOTIFICATION: <br />
<br />
  a. If we are required by law to retain or disclose user identifiers, we will<br />
     attempt to provide the users with notice (unless we are prohibited or it<br />
     would be futile) that a request for their information has been made in<br />
     order to give the users an opportunity to object to the retention or<br />
     disclosure.<br />
<br />
  b. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if the users have given<br />
     us an email address, and by postal mail if the users have provided a<br />
     postal address.                                   <br />
<br />
  c. If the users do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally<br />
     required to turn over their information.<br />
<br />
  d. We may delay notice if we, in good faith, believe that an emergency<br />
     involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person<br />
     requires disclosure without delay of information relating to the<br />
     emergency.<br />
<br />
EXCEPTIONS<br />
<br />
Data from DNT Users collected by this domain may be logged or retained only in<br />
the following specific situations:<br />
<br />
1. CONSENT / "OPT BACK IN"         <br />
<br />
  a. DNT Users are opting out from tracking across the Web.  It is possible<br />
     that for some feature or functionality, we will need to ask a DNT User to<br />
     "opt back in" to be tracked by us across the entire Web.                                    <br />
<br />
  b. If we do that, we will take reasonable steps to verify that the users who<br />
     select this option have genuinely intended to opt back in to tracking.<br />
     One way to do this is by performing scientifically reasonable user<br />
     studies with a representative sample of our users, but smaller<br />
     organizations can satisfy this requirement by other means.         <br />
<br />
  c. Where we believe that we have opt back in consent, our server will<br />
     send a tracking value status header "Tk: C" as described in section 6.2<br />
     of the W3C Tracking Preference Expression draft:<br />
<br />
     http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#tracking-status-value<br />
<br />
2. TRANSACTIONS         <br />
<br />
   If a DNT User actively and knowingly enters a transaction with our<br />
   services (for instance, clicking on a clearly-labeled advertisement,<br />
   posting content to a widget, or purchasing an item), we will retain<br />
   necessary data for as long as required to perform the transaction. This<br />
   may for example include keeping auditing information for clicks on<br />
   advertising links; keeping a copy of posted content and the name of the<br />
   posting user; keeping server-side session IDs to recognize logged in<br />
   users; or keeping a copy of the physical address to which a purchased<br />
   item will be shipped.  By their nature, some transactions will require data<br />
   to be retained indefinitely.<br />
<br />
3. TECHNICAL AND SECURITY LOGGING:                   <br />
<br />
  a. If, during the processing of the initial request (for unique identifiers)<br />
     or during the subsequent 10 days (for IP addresses and User Agent strings),<br />
     we obtain specific information that causes our employees or systems to<br />
     believe that a request is, or is likely to be, part of a security attack,<br />
     spam submission, or fraudulent transaction, then logs of those requests <br />
     are not subject to this policy.                                   <br />
<br />
  b. If we encounter technical problems with our site, then, in rare<br />
     circumstances, we may retain logs for longer than 10 days, if that is<br />
     necessary to diagnose and fix those problems, but this practice will not be<br />
     routinized and we will strive to delete such logs as soon as possible.         <br />
<br />
4. AGGREGATION:<br />
<br />
  a. We may retain and share anonymized datasets, such as aggregate records of<br />
     readership patterns; statistical models of user behavior; graphs of system<br />
     variables; data structures to count active users on monthly or yearly<br />
     bases; database tables mapping authentication cookies to logged in<br />
     accounts; non-unique data structures constructed within browsers for tasks<br />
     such as ad frequency capping or conversion tracking; or logs with truncated<br />
     and/or encrypted IP addresses and simplified User Agent strings.<br />
<br />
  b. "Anonymized" means we have conducted risk mitigation to ensure<br />
     that the dataset, plus any additional information that is in our<br />
     possession or likely to be available to us, does not allow the<br />
     reconstruction of reading habits, online or offline activity of groups of<br />
     fewer than 5000 individuals or devices. <br />
<br />
  c. If we generate anonymized datasets under this exception we will publicly<br />
     document our anonymization methods in sufficient detail to allow outside<br />
     experts to evaluate the effectiveness of those methods.<br />
<br />
5. ERRORS: <br />
<br />
From time to time, there may be errors by which user data is temporarily<br />
logged or retained in violation of this policy.  If such errors are<br />
inadvertent, rare, and made in good faith, they do not constitute a breach<br />
of this policy.  We will delete such data as soon as practicable after we<br />
become aware of any error and take steps to ensure that it is deleted by any<br />
third-party who may have had access to the data.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS<br />
<br />
"Fully Qualified Domain Name" means a domain name that addresses a computer<br />
connected to the Internet.  For instance, example1.com; www.example1.com;<br />
ads.example1.com; and widgets.example2.com are all distinct FQDNs.<br />
<br />
"Supercookie" means any technology other than an HTTP Cookie which can be used<br />
by a server to associate identifiers with the clients that visit it.  Examples<br />
of supercookies include Flash LSO cookies, DOM storage, HTML5 storage, or<br />
tricks to store information in caches or etags.<br />
<br />
"Risk mitigation" means an engineering process that evaluates the possibility<br />
and likelihood of various adverse outcomes, considers the available methods of<br />
making those adverse outcomes less likely, and deploys sufficient mitigations<br />
to bring the probability and harm from adverse outcomes below an acceptable<br />
threshold.<br />
<br />
"Reading habits" includes amongst other things lists of visited DNS names, if<br />
those domains pertain to specific topics or activities, but records of visited<br />
DNS names are not reading habits if those domain names serve content of a very<br />
diverse and general nature, thereby revealing minimal information about the<br />
opinions, interests or activities of the user.<br />
