<ul class="tos_ul">
<li class="tos_p"><b>4 Keys To Submitting A Verified Review</b></li>
<ul class="tos_ul">
<li class="tos_p"><b>Identity Check </b> <br> Our team of experts see to it that the right person gives the review. To ensure this, they check upon the reviewer's Name, Job Title, or Email Address. If the team fails in verifying the reviewer's identity, we won't publish the review.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Conflict of Interest </b> <br> Our team will verify the name and company of the reviewer against the product he/she reviews. If in any way, he/she is found associated with the vendor or identified as a vendor's direct competitor, we won't publish the review.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Content Check </b> <br> Each review gets evaluated by our team of experts to ensure that it is authentic and meets our quality standards. If the content doesn't match our Content Quality Standards, we won’t publish the review.</li>
<ul class="tos_ul">
<li class="tos_p"><b>Our Content Quality Standards (which includes the following, but isn’t limited to)</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Inappropriate, violent, or hateful language:</b> The review should not contain any obscene language. Neither should it be bullying nor discriminatory.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Spam:</b> The review should not be self-promoting or nonsensical</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Duplicate:</b> The review should not be a copy of the one already published online</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Invalid Reviewer:</b> The vendor should neither write reviews on behalf of the customers nor hire reviewers to write fake reviews. This will be considered a fraud, and necessary actions might be taken.</li>
</ul>
<li class="tos_p">We have a set of tools to ensure that the review we publish is original and help other seekers make an informed purchase decision. The review that won’t pass our standard parameters will not be considered.</li>
</ul>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Voucher Claim Policy. </b> <br>
<ul class="tos_ul">
<li class="tos_p">Verify review by adding an invoice or screenshot (paid version dashboard screenshot or billing details dashboard screenshot, we ensure complete confidentiality) to claim the voucher.</li>
<li class="tos_p">Only user who have paid subscription of the software are eligible to claim any reward for the review submited.</li>
</ul>
<br> Reviewers, who attempt to abuse our program, violate our guidelines, or are identified as spammers may be subject to penalties (which may include legal penalties). We also reserve the right to disable all of their published reviews. <br> As a neutral review platform, we won’t evaluate or claim the merit of the opinions given on our site. Also, we are not liable to check the facts while assessing the reviews to be published. However, we do offer third-party rights to flag reviews for investigation.</li>
</ul>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Vendor Guidelines </b> <br> To ensure the safety of your buyers’ right, we ask vendors to adhere to the following guidelines concerning their product and service reviews.</li>
<ul class="tos_ul">
<li class="tos_p"><b>Vendors must not attempt to influence reviews/ratings </b> <br> Federal Law forbids the imposition of any non-disparagement contract clauses in customer contracts. Inclusion of any such clause is viewed as an attempt to inflate reviews or ratings by SoftwareSuggest. If any vendor involves such clauses to inflate the reviews/ratings, penalties will apply to the vendor's portal. Also, we reserve the right to take down reviews on that basis.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Vendors must not review their or a competitor’s product </b> <br> SoftwareSuggest strictly prohibits vendors from reviewing their own product or posting a review on the customer's behalf. More so over, vendors must not post any reviews that direct any kind of strategic or financial benefit. <br> Vendors are not allowed to collect a host of reviews for our site. Only the users can submit reviews directly to our website via the review form. We do not allow vendors to review their competitor's product even though it is based on the actual experience of using the product.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Vendors must not harass reviewers based on their ratings or reviews </b> <br> Vendors are encouraged to respond constructively to the reviews on our site with the “reply” feature within the Vendors Portal. The responses must be respectful and may not contain any abusing, violent, or harassing language. However, vendors are not allowed to contact the reviewer directly or indirectly regarding the content of a review.</li>
<li class="tos_p"><b>Vendors are prohibited to abuse our review investigation service </b> <br> At SoftwareSuggest, we would be happy to investigate reviews flagged as violating our Review Guidelines. However, if we have a reason to suspect that the vendor is trying to abuse our system by unnecessarily flagging reviews for investigation, we may, at our discretion, impose penalties on the vendor's account. <br> These vendor's guidelines are applied equally to all vendors regardless of their account status. Any violation of these guidelines is subject to penalties imposed by SoftwareSuggest and the law. We reserve the right to decide the penalties, which may include a comment on Vendor's profile or suspension of services.</li>
