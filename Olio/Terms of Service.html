<p><strong>Please read this agreement carefully before accessing the App from&nbsp; our website or downloading the App from any Appstore.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>



<p>This end-user licence agreement (“<strong>EULA”</strong>) is a legal agreement between you (“<strong>End-user</strong>” or “<strong>you”</strong>) and Olio Exchange Limited (registered number 09428660) of 157A Nelson Road, London, England, N8 9RR (“<strong>Licensor”</strong>, “<strong>us”, “our”</strong> or “<strong>we”</strong>) for the licence of our:</p>



<ul>
<li>Olio mobile application software and the web-based version of the App (the “<strong>App”</strong>);&nbsp;</li>



<li>online or electronic documents (“<strong>Documents”</strong>); and</li>



<li>the services you connect to via the App and the content we provide to you through it (the “<strong>Services”</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We license the use of the App, Documents and Services to you on the basis of this EULA and subject to any terms, rules or policies applied by any appstore provider or operator from whose site (“<strong>Appstore</strong>”) the End-user downloaded the App (the “<strong>Appstore Rules</strong>”). The Appstore Rules will apply instead of the terms of this EULA where there are differences between the two.</p>



<p>Although you may subscribe for our Services, we do not sell the App, Services or Documents to you. We remain the owners of the App, Services and Documents at all times.</p>



<p><strong>Important notice:</strong></p>



<p>By accessing the App or by downloading the App from any Appstore provider you:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>agree to the terms of this EULA which will bind you. The terms of this licence include the limitations on liability in condition 6;</li>



<li>represent that you are 18 years of age or over and are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement; and</li>



<li>accept this EULA and agree that you are legally bound by its terms.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, we will not licence the App, Documents and Services to you and you must stop the downloading process or your access now.</p>



<p><strong>We recommend saving a copy of this EULA for future reference.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agreed Terms:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>
<ol>
<li>The terms of this EULA apply to the App, the Documents and the Services, including any updates or supplements to the App, unless they come with separate terms, in which case those terms apply. If any open-source software is included in the App or any Service, the terms of an open-source licence may override some of the terms of this EULA.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Olio may alter or amend these terms by notifying you by email or via the App. By continuing to use the Services and/or the App after notification, you will be deemed to have accepted any changes or amendment to these terms.&nbsp;</li>



<li>From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the Appstore. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.</li>



<li>You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of the mobile telephone, laptop or handheld devices (“<strong>Devices</strong>”) that are controlled, but not owned by you&nbsp; to download or access a copy of the App onto or from the Devices. You and they may be charged by your and their service providers for internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App or any Service on or in relation to any Device, whether or not it is owned by you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>By using the App or any Service, you acknowledge and agree that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information you send using the App or any Service may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transmission is encrypted.</li>



<li>We only use any personal data we collect through your use of the App and the Services in the ways set out in our <a href="https://olioapp.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. The use of the App and the Services will be governed by the <a href="http://olioapp.com/terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a> and subject to the Privacy Policy incorporated into this EULA by reference and set out at the following web address: <a href="https://olioapp.com/">www.olioapp.com</a>.</li>



<li>The App or any Service may contain links to other independent third-party websites (“<strong>Third-party Sites</strong>”). Third-party Sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and do not endorse their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any Third-party Sites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Any words following the terms “including”, “include”, “in particular” or, “for example” or any similar phrase in this EULA shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the generality of the related general words.</li>



<li>Any words used but not defined in the EULA shall have the same meanings as set out in the Terms and Conditions.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>Grant and Scope of Licence</strong>
<ol>
<li>In consideration of you agreeing to abide by the terms of this EULA, we grant you a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive licence to use: (i) the App on the Devices; (ii) the Documentation; (iii) and the Services, subject to our Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy and the Appstore Rules, incorporated into this EULA by reference. We reserve all other rights.</li>

<ol>
<li>is used only for the purpose of achieving interoperability of the App or the Services with another software program;</li>



<li>is not unnecessarily disclosed or communicated without our prior written consent to any third party; and</li>

<li>to comply with all technology control or export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the App or any Service; and&nbsp;</li>

</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>Limitation Of Liability</strong>

<li>You may only transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person if we agree in writing.</li>



<li>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and it will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.</li>



<li>Geographic Restrictions. The Content and Services are based in the United Kingdom and provided for access and use by anyone subject to local laws and restrictions.

<li>This EULA, our Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the App, the Documents and the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the App, the Documents and the Services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>This EULA has been entered into on the date of download of or access to the App.</li>



<li>Waiver. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this EULA and any other terms, the terms of this EULA shall take precedence.</li>



<li>Disclaimer of warranties. The App, the Documents and the Services are provided to the End-User “as is” and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.

<li>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Terms applicable in the United States of America</strong>
<ol>
<li>The following terms apply in addition to those set out above for users in the United States of America.</li>
