</li>



<li><strong>How Data is collected</strong>
<ol>
<li>Automatic Data collection and tracking
<ol>
<li>When you download, access and use the App, it may use technology to automatically collect:
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage details:</strong> when you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the App, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Device information:</strong> we may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device’s telephone number.</li>



<li><strong>Stored information and files:</strong> the App also may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information. You will be asked for your consent to such access and use of your Data within the App.&nbsp; You can withdraw your consent at any time via the settings menu.</li>

We store the location of a user at set points, for example when you choose to update your location and when you create/edit an item. Some of our location-enabled services require your Data for the feature to work. You will be asked for your consent to such access and use of your Data within the App. Note, however, that opting out of the App’s collection of location information will cause its location-based features to be disabled. You can withdraw your consent at any time via the settings menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li>If you do not&nbsp; agree to us&nbsp; collecting this information, please do not create an account with us.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Analytical/performance cookies</strong>: these allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors on and to see how visitors move around the App when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our App works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These cookies are used to collect information about how visitors use our App. We use the information to compile reports on general user traffic, conversion statistics and to help us improve the App. These cookies collect information anonymously.</li>



<li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>: pages of the App and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related app statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain app content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>



<li><strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> these are used to recognise you when you return to our App. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). By using the App, you agree to our placement of functionality cookies.</li>



<li><strong>Targeting cookies:</strong> these record your visit to our App, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.

</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>



<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Keeping Data secure</strong>
<ol>
<li>We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your Data from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration and disclosure, for example:
<ol>
<li>access to your account is controlled by a password and a username that is unique to you; and</li>



<li>we store your Data on secure servers.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the App like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the App.</li>



<li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Data transmitted through our App. Any transmission of Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you suspect that there has been a breach of the security of your data you should contact us at: <a href="mailto:hello@olioex.com">hello@olioapp.com</a> and include details of the nature, the date and the full circumstances of the breach.</li>



<li>On notification of such a breach, we will investigate the matter and, where appropriate and required by law, notify the relevant data protection regulator.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>How personal data is shared and with whom.</strong>
<ol>
<li>You may provide information to be published or displayed (“<strong>Posted</strong>“) on public areas of the App (collectively, “<strong>User Contributions</strong>“). Your User Contributions are Posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorised persons.</li>



<li>We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device, without restriction.&nbsp;</li>



<li>In addition, we may disclose Data that we collect or you provide:
<ol>
<li>to our subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>



<li>to contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>



<li>to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Data held by the Company about our App users is among the assets transferred.</li>



<li>to fulfil the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an email address to use the “email a friend” feature of our App, we will transmit the contents of that email and your email address to the recipients.</li>



<li>for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>



<li>for the purposes of academic research.</li>



<li>for any other purpose with your consent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>



<li>to enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>



<li>if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>What choices you have with respect to how personal data is used.</strong>
<ol>
<li>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Data you provide to us. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information. You may need to adjust the settings on your device to restrict the collection of information by the App but this may prevent you from accessing all of the features of the App.
<ol>
<li><strong>Tracking Technologies:</strong> you may be able to set your browser or device to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>



<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> you can choose whether or not to allow the App to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings. If you block the use of location information, some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
