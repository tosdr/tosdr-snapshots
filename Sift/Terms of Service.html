<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.4 <em>Feedback and Labels</em>.</span> If Customer (including any Authorized User) provides Sift any feedback (often referred to as “labels”) in connection with the Sift Services about whether a transaction or event on a Customer Property is associated with fraud, abuse or other illegal activity, Customer shall use reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of such feedback and grants Sift an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or labels for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to Customer or any Authorized User. Sift may label transactions or events on behalf of Customer in order to improve the accuracy of the Sift Services for Customer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.5 <em>Aggregated Data</em>.</span> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Sift <span style="font-weight: 400;">has the right with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perpetual</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">royalty-free, irrevocable license to</span> use data derived from Customer Data in connection with Customer’s use of the Sift Services that is aggregated with comparable data received from other customers (<b>“Aggregated Data”</b>) for (a) Sift’s internal purposes such as operating, maintaining, and improving the Sift Services, and (b) distribution of general benchmarking or industry-related reports as part of the Sift Services. For absolute clarity, such Aggregated Data shall not be reasonably capable of identifying any underlying individual nor identify the Customer as a source of any Aggregated Data<span style="font-weight: 400;">, nor shall any output of Sift’s use of Aggregated Data include any Customer’s Confidential Information (as subsequently defined) or personal data (as defined under Applicable Laws)</span>. Sift will make no attempt to reidentify the Aggregated Data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.6 <em>Beta Services</em>.</span> From time to time, Sift may invite Customer to try features or pre-release versions of the Sift Services that are not generally available to customers for non-production use (“<strong>Beta Services</strong>”). Customer may accept or decline such invitation in its sole discretion. Beta Services will be clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation or by a description of similar import. Customer&#8217;s use of Beta Services will be for the term specified by Sift and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Services or when that version of the Beta Services becomes generally available, and therefore part of the Sift Services. Sift may discontinue Beta Services at any time in Sift’s sole discretion and may never make them generally available. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. SIFT HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BETA SERVICE.</p>
