<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3.2.2. Location Information.</strong></h3>



<p>Some of our Applications may have the ability to provide content to you based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature. Your GPS location is your exact location. You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the Application.&nbsp; You can edit that setting on your device at any time. If you enable these features, your GPS location will be found by satellite, cellphone tower, or Wi-Fi and used by the Application. If you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider’s servers.</p>



<p>If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific Application does not have location-based features, we do not collect your precise GPS location.&nbsp; However, we do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location.&nbsp; Ads on our Websites and Applications may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are not targeted based on your GPS location.</p>



<p>We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, ZIP code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in a specific US State and city or region, the Services may be customized with information and advertisements relevant to that specific US State, city, or region.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. How Do We Use Online Analytics &amp; Interest-Based Advertising?</strong></h1>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6.1.&nbsp;Our Use of Online Analytics.</strong></h2>



<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those provided by Google Analytics, Adobe Omniture, The Trade Desk, and similar providers.&nbsp; These service providers use the sort of technology described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#section-3-2-3">Section 3.2.3</a>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy&nbsp; to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by these technologies will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#section-6-2">Section 6.2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#section-8-1">Section 8.1</a>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy and in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>. You can opt-out of Google Analytics as described in Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6.2.&nbsp;Our Use of Interest-Based Advertising.</strong></h2>



<p>When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, Personal Information and other information that you provide, such as, your age or gender, your searches, demographic and geographic data, User-Generated Content, and other information that you provide to us. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be based on your interests.</p>



<p><a>When you use the Services, we may share information about you, such as a hashed version of your email address, your IP address, and information about your device settings with our third-party advertising technology providers.&nbsp; Those advertising technology providers may use that information to assign you a unique ID for the purpose of recognizing you on your devices. W</a>e may place this unique ID in our first-party cookie, or use a partner that places a third-party cookie and allows it to be used for online and interest-based ad targeting. Your unique ID may be shared by us or on our behalf with third-party advertisers for interest-based ad targeting.</p>



<p>Also, third parties, including without limitation those whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may place cookies, web beacons or pixel tags, or other similar tracking technologies (such as mobile ‘SDKs,’ which function like a mobile version of a browser cookie and are embedded in mobile applications) on your computer browser, mobile phone applications, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, including your Personal Information, in order to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and mobile applications; and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Websites, Applications, Platform, and the use of our Services. We also allow other third parties to serve interest-based ads to you via the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services so that interest-based ads may be delivered to you when you are using other websites and mobile applications<a>. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, your IP address, and/or information about your browser or operating system, which may be identified by a service provider for purposes of delivering interest-based advertising on the Services, other websites, and/or mobile applications</a>. We likewise may work with platform providers who serve advertising across devices. For instance, we may want to reach our web-based customers when they are on their mobile devices. This is done, generally, by correlating common attributes (such as IP addresses, other browser or device information, hashed email addresses, or unique ID) across devices, to infer a common identity across multiple channels.</p>



<p>Where a third party advertiser assigns you a unique ID, we may place this unique ID in our first party cookie, or use a partner that places a third party cookie and allows it to be used for online and interest based ad targeting. Your unique ID may be shared by us or on our behalf with third party advertisers for interest based ad targeting.</p>



<p>The third parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting, as is described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp;and in <a>Section 8 (What are Your Rights &amp; Choices?) </a><a href="#_msocom_1">[LN1]</a>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy. We do not maintain or control these opt-opt mechanisms, which are provided by non-affiliated third parties. Further, we do not control which third parties choose to participate in these opt-out mechanisms. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.</p>



<p>You can opt-out of targeted or cross-contextual advertising, as those terms are defined in applicable privacy laws, by visiting our <a href="https://my.datasubject.com/16A1AnRt2Fn8i1unj/77">Do Not Sell/Share My Information page</a>.

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Additional Privacy Rights and Choices of U.S. Residents</strong></h1>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9.1 Your California Privacy Rights</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Notice For California Residents</strong></p>



<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“<strong>CPRA</strong>”) (the CPPA and CPRA, collectively the “<strong>California Privacy Laws</strong>”) gives California residents certain rights and choices about how we collect, use, and disclose their Personal Information. This Section 9.1 of this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>California Notice</strong>”) describes these additional rights and choices and provides disclosures required by the California Privacy Laws about how we collect, use, and disclose California residents’ Personal Information.</p>



<p>This California Notice applies to information of California residents that constitutes “Personal Information” under the California Privacy Laws to the extent that we handle such California Personal Information in our capacity as a business under the California Privacy Laws. For purposes of this California Notice Section of this Privacy Policy, the capitalized term “Personal Information” refers to information of California residents that constitutes “personal information” under the California Privacy Laws, as distinguished from the general definition of Personal Information set forth under Section 1.1 of this Privacy Policy. As a practical matter, if you are a California resident that uses the Services, there is likely little or no difference between Personal Information as used in this California Notice Section of the Privacy Policy and the definition of Personal Information provided above in Section 1.1. This California Notice does not apply to information exempt from, or otherwise not subject to, the requirements of the California Privacy Laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>California Notice at Collection – The Personal Information That We Collect</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sale, Sharing, &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>



<p>The table below identifies the categories of Personal Information that we sold or shared to third parties in the 12 months preceding the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy, and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared each identified category of Personal Information:</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect, sell, share, or otherwise disclose Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.&nbsp; We currently do not use “Sensitive Personal Information” (as that term is defined by the California Privacy Laws) for purposes other than those the California Privacy Laws allow for.</p>

<p><strong>CCPA Rights</strong></p>



<p>The California Privacy Laws (i.e., the CCPA as amended by the CPRA) grants California residents the rights described below. These rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exemptions. As such, in certain cases, we may deny your requests regarding these rights as permitted by law.</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Right to Know.&nbsp;</strong>The right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing (if applicable), the categories of third parties to whom we sell or share Personal Information (if applicable), and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;</li>

<p><strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong>&nbsp;You have a right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.&nbsp; As stated above, we do not “sell” your Personal Information in the traditional sense (i.e., for money).&nbsp; However, we may disclose your Personal Information in the following ways that may constitute a “sale” and/or “share” of your Personal Information within the legal definitions of those terms under the California Privacy Laws:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Like many news media companies, we use services that help us deliver interest-based ads to you on our Websites, Applications, and Platform, such as the services associated with cookies described in this Privacy Policy and our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.&nbsp; Our use of these services may constitute a “sale” or “share” of your Personal Information for purposes of the California Privacy Laws, because the advertising partners we use that provide these services collect information from our users, including Personal Information, when users visit our Websites, Applications, or Platform (e.g., device data, cookies, online activity, IP address, as described above) to help serve ads to users that are more likely to be of interest to them.</li>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Use of The Services by Users from Outside The United States</strong></h1>



<p>We have worked hard to ensure that our business complies with applicable international consumer data privacy laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “<strong>UK GDPR”),&nbsp;</strong>and others.&nbsp; Under applicable law in the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland, MNG is considered a “data controller” of the Personal Information that we handle under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; In other words, MNG is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose this Personal Information, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Under applicable laws, if you are a resident of certain jurisdictions outside of the United States and use the Services, you may be able to request one or more individual rights set forth in the “Your EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland Rights &amp; Choices” Section of this Privacy Policy below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10.1 Your EU, EEA, UK, &amp; Switzerland Rights &amp; Choices.</strong></h2>



<p><a>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, we are a data controller of your Personal Information. </a>We are headquartered in the United States, where we store and process information relating to the use of the Services, including your Personal Information.&nbsp; If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States – or another country in which we (or our service providers) operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we transfer your Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we implement at least one of the following safeguards:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We transfer your Personal Information to countries that the European Commission has determined provide an adequate level of data protection (a full list of these countries can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">here</a>).</li>



<li>We take steps to ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information is bound by contractual obligations, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“<strong>SCCs</strong>”) and additional safeguards to protect your Personal Information (you may review the EU SCCs that came into effect in September 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">here</a>).</li>
</ul>



<p>The courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in these countries may sometimes be entitled to access your Personal Information under applicable laws.</p>



<p>If you are a resident of the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain privacy rights under applicable laws, which include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your right to access and copy certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;</li>



<li>Your right to correct or update Personal Information that we maintain about you information that is incorrect or outdated;</li>



<li>Your right to prevent the processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes (including direct marketing processing based on profiling);</li>



<li>Your right to delete certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;</li>



<li>Your right to transfer the Personal Information that we hold about you to a third-party service provider;</li>



<li>Your right to restrict the way we process and disclose certain of your Personal Information; and</li>



<li>Your right to revoke your consent to the processing of your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you reside in a country other than one of those listed above, you may be able to make a request to us to exercise one or more of the rights listed above under applicable laws.&nbsp; In order to make such a request to us, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com">MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com</a>.&nbsp; So that we may respond to your request, we may need to verify your identity, country of residence, or require that you provide us with additional information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If applicable, if you think your rights have been violated, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country in which you reside or seek a remedy through the local court system. However, we encourage you to first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/contact-us/">contact us&nbsp;</a>with any questions or concerns if you feel your rights have been violated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Your Additional Marketing &amp; Interest-Based Advertising Choices</strong></p>



<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp;has information about how to manage your cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to personalized advertising. Additional information about how to op-out of cookies and similar technologies that we use on the Services for online analytics and interest-based advertising purposes is also detailed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#section-8-2">Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy (Your Additional Rights &amp; Choices For Third Parties &amp; Our Online Analytics &amp; Interest-Based Advertising Practices</a>).</p>



<p>If you reside in the EU, EEA, UK, Canda, or Switzerland you may opt-out of (i.e., withdraw your consent to) receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions in such emails.&nbsp; You may also withdraw your consent to our use of your email to provide you with special offers via email and through certain other means (such as Social Media) by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com">MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What is Our Legal Basis?</strong></p>



<p>In certain jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we may only collect, use, or share Personal Information about you if we have a valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”).&nbsp; A valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”) is one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You provide us with your consent at the point of collection of your Personal Information;</li>



<li>The performance of a contract that we have with you;</li>



<li>Our compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to;</li>



<li>Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party.&nbsp; A “legitimate interest” is a special legal term under international privacy laws, like the GDPR, which essentially means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights.&nbsp; The term “legitimate interest” can also refer to our use of your Personal Information in ways that you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal impact on your privacy rights.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We have legitimate interests in gathering and processing Personal Information.&nbsp; Our legitimate interests include, but are not necessarily limited to: administering and conducting business within MNG; ensuring that our networks, Services, Websites, Applications, Platform, and information are secure; conducting our marketing activities; and preventing fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IAB EU Transparency and Consent Framework</strong></p>



<p>We participate in the IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework and comply with its Specifications and Policies. We use the Consent Management Platform with the identification number 279.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11. How Can You Access, Correct, Or Update Your Personal Information?</strong></h1>



<p>You may request that we provide you with access to the Personal Information that we have about you, or that we update or correct the Personal Information that we have about you.&nbsp; Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may have a legal right to request access to the Personal Information we have about you under applicable laws.&nbsp; Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you also may have a legal right under applicable laws to request that we correct or update certain Personal Information that we have about you.&nbsp; Some of our Websites may allow you to access, correct, or update some of your Personal Information directly (i.e., user profile information) by logging in to the relevant portions of the Services where such information may be updated. In accordance with applicable laws, you may also request access to the Personal Information that we have about you and/or request that we correct or update certain Personal Information that we have about you by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com">MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable laws, even if you request that we update, correct, or delete Personal Information that we hold about you, we may need to retain certain of your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations or otherwise for our legitimate record-keeping and business purposes. Please refer to&nbsp;Section 14 of this Privacy Policy (How Long Do We Retain Your Information?)&nbsp;for additional information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>12. What About Linked Third-Party Services, Sites, &amp; Advertisements That I See Via The Services?</strong></h1>



<p>Some of the Services may sometimes contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors, advertisers, and other products and services. These are not part of the Services we provide to you. We do not control (and are not responsible for) the privacy practices, websites, content, and goods or services of these third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As is discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, these third parties may independently collect and solicit Personal Information about you directly from you. The Personal Information that you provide to them directly is not covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; These third parties have their own privacy policies and practices, which may include what (if any) of your Personal Information they share with us, your privacy rights and choices with respect to their services and devices, and whether they process and store information in the United States or outside of the United States. As such, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies, practices, and terms of use and to contact them if you have any questions, concerns, or want to opt-out or limit how they collect or use your Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>13. How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</strong></h1>



<p>We have endeavored to protect the privacy, security, and integrity of your Personal Information using what we believe to be appropriate administrative, technical, organizational, and physical security controls and measures (collectively, “<strong>Security Measures</strong>”). These Security Measures may vary based on a variety of factors, including, the sensitivity of the Personal Information about you that we process and maintain, the state of technology, and applicable laws.</p>



<p>The purpose of our Security Measures is to protect your Personal Information from accidental or unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, disclosure, loss, use, or illegal processing. Although we take maintaining the security and integrity of the Personal Information that we hold about you extremely seriously, we cannot guarantee that our Security Measures will provide your Personal Information with absolute security or that your Personal Information will never be used in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security and integrity of the Personal Information that we maintain about you at any time.&nbsp; In accordance with applicable law, we will notify you electronically, in writing, by telephone, and/or by other means in the event that we become subject to a data breach involving the unauthorized or unlawful use of the Personal Information about you that we maintain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Safeguarding Communications</strong></p>



<p>From time to time, via the Services, we may send you emails, text messages, mobile device push notifications, or other communications, which communications may contain your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information (such as your name, email address, password to your account for the Services, or billing or payment information).&nbsp; Safeguarding any such Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information contained in any such communications by us to you is solely your responsibility.&nbsp; We are not responsible for safeguarding any such communications once they are sent to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>14. How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information?</strong></h1>



<p>We retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfil the purposes for which we collect it (for example, for as long as is necessary to provide you with the Services that you have requested); and (2) satisfy any legal, accounting, contractual, record keeping, or reporting requirements that apply to us. This means that we might retain your Personal Information even after you close your account with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the applicable retention period for your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws.&nbsp; If deletion or anonymization of your Personal Information is not possible, in accordance with applicable laws, we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>



<p>If you stop visiting our Websites for at least 13 months, we may mark your account for removal.&nbsp; In that case, your account information will remain for another 12 months and then may be removed.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>15. What Are the Requirements or Guidelines for The Use of Our Services By Children?</strong></h1>



<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.&nbsp; The Services are not intended to be accessed or used by persons under the age of 18.&nbsp; By using the Services, you hereby represent that you are at least 18 years of age. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit any Personal Information online from children under the age of 18.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for an account or other subscription to the Services from us.&nbsp;Some third parties, such as platform providers like the iTunes Store or Google Play may provide age-based ratings on some of the Services. &nbsp;These ratings shall have no bearing on this limitation. &nbsp;Third parties may also provide content categories on some of the Services. &nbsp;These categories likewise shall have no bearing on this limitation.</p>
