<h2>Privacy</h2>
<h3>Personal information we collect, and how it's used</h3>
<h3>Profile information</h3>
<p>You may provide us with profile information such as your e-mail address, name, and password when you sign up for a
    subscription, create an account, or when you edit your account information.</p>
<p>We use your email address to provide you with updates to your subscribed feeds, and we may also use it to provide you
    with technical support or billing notifications.</p>
<p>We do not store your password directly, instead we store a non-reversible cryptographic hash using an industry
    standard hashing mechanism.</p>
<p>We retain your profile information until you delete your account.</p>

<h3>Site visitation and tracking</h3>
<p>
    Like many websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine
    the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their
    journey through the website.

    Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of
    this information personally identifies you to us.  We configure our tracking codes to anonymise any IP addresses.
</p>

<h3>Payment details</h3>
<p>
    We do not store your payment details ourselves, instead we partner with ChargeBee, a Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS) level 1 certified payment services provider.
</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>Our Free plan is supported by adverts placed in the update emails you receive.  We try and keep these adverts
appropriate to your language, country, and interests.</p>

<p>We partner with LiveIntent to provide this advertising, and you can read their privacy policy here:
    <a href="https://liveintent.com/services-privacy-policy">https://liveintent.com/services-privacy-policy</a></p>

<p>In order for LiveIntent to provide you with relevant advertising, we share a hashed representation of your email address with them.</p>

<h3>Support by e-mail</h3>
<p>If you contact us by email, you will be sharing your contact details (e-mail address and name) with us for the
    purposes of responding to your query. This is necessary to provide our service to you.  We retain all support
    tickets for the purposes of auditing and training of staff.</p>

<h3>Backups</h3>
<p>We maintain data backups for use in disaster recovery.  These backups are encrypted and stored securely for 1 year.</p>


<h3>Our servers</h3>
<p>We operate using both cloud and physical servers located in the UK, Ireland, and Germany.  Your personal information
    is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access
    rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. All sensitive information you supply
    is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) technology.</p>

<h3>Correcting your personal data</h3>
<p>You may update your details at any time through our website.</p>

<h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
<p>Accounts can be deleted at any time from your Account Settings page, or by <a href='/help/#contactus'>contacting support.</a></p>

<h3>Data Breaches</h3>
<p>We will report any unlawful data breach of this websiteâ€™s database or the database(s) of any of our third-party data
    processors to any and all relevant persons and authorities within 72 hours of the breach if it is apparent that
    personal data stored in an identifiable manner has been stolen.</p>

<h3>Use of our services by persons under the age of 16</h3>
<p>We do not allow anyone under the age of 16 to sign up or use our service. If we discover or are notified about the
    presence of a user under this age, we will remove their data from our systems without notice.</p>

<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This privacy policy may change from time to time in line with legislation or industry developments. We will not
    explicitly inform our clients or website users of these changes. Instead, we recommend that you check this page
    occasionally for any policy changes.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of information to law enforcement agencies</h3>
<p>We may release information if we are requested to by law enforcement agencies, where we believe the release is
    appropriate to comply with the law.</p>

<h3>Our Third Party Data Processors</h3>
<p>We use a number of third parties to process personal data on our behalf</p>

<h2>Refunds and cancellations</h2>

<p>All plans are available free of charge for a 1 month period, so you can fully evaluate our service before committing.  
After the trial period expires, your card will be billed according to the plan's billing period.<br />
<br />
You can cancel your service any time. However, no refunds are offered for any unused portion of time in a billing period.
</p>
<p>All sales for services are final: Blogtrottr Ltd does not offer refunds at this time, but under certain circumstances
we may offer pro-rated credit for services purchased.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="euvat">EU VAT</h2>
<p>In order to comply with the EU's <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/buying-goods-services-online-personal-use/buying-services/electronically-supplied-services_en">2015 rules</a> on the supply of electronic services, Blogtrottr is obliged to charge VAT on invoices to EU consumers, in accordance with the local VAT rate of the member state where the customer belongs.</p>
    
<p>EU businesses who supply a VAT number will be charged no VAT, as it will be for them to account for the tax under the EU VAT reverse charge mechanism.</p>   

<p>Blogtrottr currently trades below the UK VAT threshold, and thus no VAT will be added for UK customers.</p>
