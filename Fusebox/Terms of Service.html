<p>Whenever possible, each provision of these Terms of Use shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of these Terms of Use shall be prohibited, void, invalid, or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, invalidity, voidability, or enforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this agreement. We and you agree that any ambiguity, vagueness or applicability of any provision of this agreement shall not be construed against the drafting party because of its being the drafter of this agreement. The headings for sections herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning of the provisions of this agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>No Waiver</strong></p>



<p>Our failure to exercise any right or remedy under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy.</p>



<p><strong>Independent contractors</strong></p>



<p>These Terms of Use do not create or have any intention of creating a joint venture, partnership, employer/employee relationship, agency, or fiduciary relationship between you and us. You are, at all times in connection with the operation of these Terms of Use, an independent contractor.</p>



<p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>



<p>In case of a dispute between us and you relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute personally and in good faith. If these personal resolution attempts fail, the Member and Licensor shall then submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the county and state noted in the GOVERNING LAW section of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and such arbitrator shall have no authority to add any party, vary the provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a class. The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing federal and state law of California. The Parties hereby agree to each pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this section include, but are not limited to: contract claims, tort claims, claims based on federal and state law, and claims based on local laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual Property claims by Licensor will not be subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to this subpart, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this subpart of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a jury trial in regard to arbitral claims.</p>



<p><strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>



<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in the county of San Diego, California</p>



<p><strong>Survival&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>All obligations of the Parties hereto contained in this agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this agreement.</p>



<p><strong>Force Majeure&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If the performance by us under this Agreement is prevented, hindered, or otherwise made impractical by reason of flood, strike, war, acts of government, or any other casualty or cause beyond the control of us, then We shall be excused from its performance to the extent and so long as it is prevented, hindered, or delayed by such event(s).</p>
