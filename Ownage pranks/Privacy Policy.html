They prey on unsuspecting victims by tricking them into purchasing gift cards and then providing the scammer with the card information, often under the guise of paying for goods or services. These scammers are not only deceitful, but they are also ruthless, as they often target vulnerable individuals such as the elderly or those who are not well-versed in online transactions. \n\nScammers can cause financial loss and emotional distress to their victims, but getting revenge on them is a funny and satisfying experience. \n\nIt&rsquo;s time for payback. In my animated prank call video, I take a humorous approach to tackling the issue of gift card scams by getting revenge on the scammers through roasting them. \n\nThrough the use of animation, the video brings to life the comedic aspect of scamming the scammers and serves as a reminder that while gift card scams are a serious issue, there is always a way to find humor in any situation. As you laugh at the most brainless swindlers on the planet, I hope this video is not only entertaining but also informative and serves as a warning for people to be vigilant and aware of gift card scams. In addition, it is also important to report these scum scammers to the proper authorities and warn others about their tactics.

<h2><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: bold;">NOTICES TO USERS:&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">RECORDING OTHERS USING THE APP MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY</span></h2>
<p>This Service offers a feature enabling users to record others during a call. Depending on the state or country in which you are located <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">or</span> the person you are calling is located,&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1050-scope-18-usc-2511-prohibitions"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #45b0e1; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">you may violate a state&rsquo;s</span></a>&nbsp;or country&rsquo;s law by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing them. You may not&mdash;and represent and warrant you have/will not&mdash;use the recording capability of the Service unless you have determined that your use is legal each time you use the feature.</p>
<p>Before recording any call, you must check the laws of your state and the laws of any state in which a person you are calling is located in order to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call. Even if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call. If you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.</p>
<p>You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #45b0e1; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&ldquo;Do Not Call&rdquo; registry</span></a> or any similar &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; list.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">CERTAIN NUMBERS ARE FULLY RESTRICTED FROM CALLING</span></h2>
<p>You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call emergency lines, health care facilities, government agencies, employees or officials, law enforcement, schools, numbers assigned to radio common carrier services, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call. Calling one of these entities shall result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and may possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">YOU MAY CALL ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY</span></h2>
<p>You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call anyone you have not had a personal interaction with. Although the scripts are often cartoonish and often outlandish, some of the scripts may be scary or misleading to people who may not be expecting these calls or who cannot get a personal, friendly explanation about the nature of the call. We&rsquo;ve therefore chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction. Calling strangers can result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and would possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">YOU GRANT PERMISSION FOR US TO CALL YOU AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE PEOPLE YOU CALL</span></h2>

You represent and warrant that any numbers you have called using the App meet the guidelines of this Agreement and assent to us calling or following up with any of those phone numbers you have called using the App.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">THIS APP CANNOT BE USED FOR AUTODIALING AND ROBOCALLS</span></h2>

Any attempts to use the Services in an automated nature shall result in immediate termination of your account and may result in civil or criminal penalties.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">VIRTUAL MONEY AND GOODS</span></h2>
<p>The Service may permit the purchase of virtual currency, such as credits, points, and gems (&ldquo;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Virtual Money</span>&rdquo;), and use of that Virtual Money to purchase virtual object or services (&ldquo;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Virtual Goods</span>&rdquo;). Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are collectively referred to as &ldquo;Virtual Items.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">License to Virtual Items</span></h3>
<p>Your purchase of Virtual Money grants you only a limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Money to access and purchase Virtual Goods in conjunction with your personal, noncommercial use of the Service.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">No Ownership</span></h3>
<p>You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual Items. Any balance of Virtual Items does not reflect any stored value. You agree that Virtual Items have no monetary value and do not constitute actual currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for &ldquo;real&rdquo; money, &ldquo;real&rdquo; goods, or &ldquo;real&rdquo; services from us or anyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Only Obtain Virtual Items Through Official Channels</span></h3>
<p>You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Items from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third-party platform, exchange, broker, or other mechanism, unless expressly authorized.&nbsp;Once you acquire a license to Virtual Items, you may not trade or transfer the Virtual Items to another individual or account, unless such functionality is provided to you by us by way of a feature or service, whether inside the Service or through some other method (e.g., a third-party website we authorize). We may cancel any Virtual Item &nbsp;sold, transferred, or exchanged in violation of this Agreement. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited and may result in the termination of your account.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Redemption and Pricing of Virtual Items</span></h3>
<p>During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you have the option to redeem your Virtual Money for selected Virtual Goods. Pricing and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to change and update our pricing and inventory of Virtual Items. All Virtual Items are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Items are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any unused Items once the transaction has been made.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Purchases by End Users Outside the U.S.</span></h3>
<p>Virtual Items may only be purchased and held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Service are permitted. If you live in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from online purchases. However, please note that once you download Virtual Money from us, your right of withdrawal ends.&nbsp;You agree that (a) purchase of Virtual Money involves immediate download of such Content; and (b) you lose your right of withdrawal once your purchase is complete. If you live in the European Union, you will need to ensure your compliance with VAT when required to do so by law. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.&nbsp;We reserve the right to control, regulate, change, or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Suspension or Cancellation</span></h3>
<p>We may cancel, suspend, or terminate your account and your access to your Virtual Items, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, in situations including, but not limited to, if (a) your account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged into); (b) you fail to comply with this Agreement; (c ) we suspect fraud or misuse by you of Virtual Items; (d) we suspect any other unlawful activity associated with your account; or (e) we are acting to protect the Service, our systems, any of our users, or our reputation. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and will not reimburse or refund, you for any Virtual Items lost due to such cancellation, suspension, or termination. You acknowledge that Ownage Labs is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary.&nbsp;In the case Ownage Labs cancels your account, Ownage Labs will not be required to provide you with prior notice or explanation in respect of such action. Notwithstanding the cancellation of access to your account in any case, you agree you will remain fully liable for any outstanding liability owed to Ownage Labs. Ownage Labs may, where it believes such action is necessary, without notice block IP addresses of any users who Ownage Labs believes have breached that Agreement.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span></h3>
<p>We have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Items, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Items entirely, then we will provide notice to you by posting a notice on the Service or through other communications.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">ASSUMPTION OF RISK</span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></h2>
<p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, IF NO AMOUNT WAS PAID FOR THE SERVICE, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $100.

<h2><span style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: bold;">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></h2>
<p>For any dispute you have with Ownage Labs, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally by contacting us through <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.ownagepranks.com/complaints/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #45b0e1; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">this form</span></a>. At the commencement of the dispute resolution process, the parties shall exchange written statements of position and shall provide documents that they believe support their position.&nbsp; The informal dispute resolution process shall be pursued for a period not less than sixty (60) days. In the unlikely event that Ownage Labs is not able to resolve a dispute after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;) through binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Unless you and Ownage Labs agreed otherwise, arbitration will be conducted in Arlington, VA by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) and you waive all objections, including without limitation all objections based on convenience and/or cost, to such location. Subject to AAA Rules available at https://www.adr.org/Rules, each party will be responsible for its own expenses and costs of arbitration, including payment of any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. For avoidance of doubt, if there are one or more disputed items that remain unresolved at the end of the arbitration, the arbitrator will render a final and binding decision on those unresolved items. The arbitrator's decisions shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related to intellectual property rights or unauthorized access to or use of the Service.</p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&rsquo; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY&rsquo;S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OWNAGE LABS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL, INCLUDING ANY PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CLAIMANT. YOU AND OWNAGE LABS ARE INSTEAD ELECTING TO HAVE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p>Ownage Labs and its partners use cookies or similar technologies, which store certain information on your computer and allows us to, among other things, analyze trends, administer the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base. The technology used to collect information automatically from Ownage Labs Users may include the following:</p>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 48px;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Cookies: </span>Like many websites, we and our operational partners, analytics, and service providers use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device, and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session. We also use certain cookies to enhance the reliability, security and performance of our Website, including cookies that are passed by our Web Application Firewall. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Website</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Web Beacons: </span>We and our operational partners, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;tracking tags&rdquo; to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Embedded Scripts: </span>We and our operational partners, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Third-Party Tracking Technologies</span></p>
<p>Ownage Labs uses third-party vendor tracking cookies, pixels, and other technologies such as Google Analytics to collect data about your activities when you visit our website, the website of entities for which we serve advertisements, or the websites and online services where we display advertisements. This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you purchase, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Retargeting&rdquo; or &ldquo;Remarketing&rdquo;). We collect information about where you saw the ads, we serve you and what ads you clicked on to measure the success of our advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (DAA) by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website (<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #45b0e1; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</span></a>) and DAA website (<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #45b0e1; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</span></a>).</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Google Analytics</span></h3>
<p>Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (as amended for government websites) and the Google Privacy Policy.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">PRIVACY RIGHTS</span></h3>

Residents of certain jurisdictions may access, correct, update, or delete your personal information; object to our processing of this information, ask us to restrict our processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Please review the information within this section to learn more about exercising your rights.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 8.05pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Upon request, Ownage Labs will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.

<p style="margin-right: 8.05pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;">We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your requests for deletion; however, certain residual information may actively persist on the Service even if you close your account. In addition, the rights described above may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information, we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as for fraud prevention purposes). Your Personal Information may remain in our archives and information you update or delete, or information within a closed account, may persist internally for our administrative purposes, to the extent permitted by law. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete information from our databases. In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly through or on the Service. Bear in mind that neither you nor Ownage Labs can delete all copies of information that has been previously shared with others on the Service. If your information is deleted, then your account may become deactivated. If your account is deactivated or you ask to close your account, you will no longer be able to use the Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 8.05pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Please note that our Services require a minimum amount of Personal Information in order to function.
