They prey on unsuspecting victims by tricking them into purchasing gift cards and then providing the scammer with the card information, often under the guise of paying for goods or services. These scammers are not only deceitful, but they are also ruthless, as they often target vulnerable individuals such as the elderly or those who are not well-versed in online transactions. \n\nScammers can cause financial loss and emotional distress to their victims, but getting revenge on them is a funny and satisfying experience. \n\nIt&rsquo;s time for payback. In my animated prank call video, I take a humorous approach to tackling the issue of gift card scams by getting revenge on the scammers through roasting them. \n\nThrough the use of animation, the video brings to life the comedic aspect of scamming the scammers and serves as a reminder that while gift card scams are a serious issue, there is always a way to find humor in any situation. As you laugh at the most brainless swindlers on the planet, I hope this video is not only entertaining but also informative and serves as a warning for people to be vigilant and aware of gift card scams. In addition, it is also important to report these scum scammers to the proper authorities and warn others about their tactics.

Depending on the state or country in which you are located </span><strong style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><u>or</u></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> the person you are calling is located,</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a style="text-decoration-line: none;" href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1050-scope-18-usc-2511-prohibitions" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="color: #0563c1; text-decoration-line: underline;">you may violate a state&rsquo;s</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">or country&rsquo;s law by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing them.

<p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Before recording any call, you must check the laws of your state and the laws of any state in which a person you are calling is located in order to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call. Even if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call. If you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national <a style="text-decoration-line: none;" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"><span style="color: #0563c1; text-decoration-line: underline;">&ldquo;Do Not Call&rdquo; registry</span></a> or any similar &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CERTAIN NUMBERS ARE FULLY RESTRICTED FROM CALLING</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call emergency lines, health care facilities, government agencies, employees or officials, law enforcement, schools, numbers assigned to radio common carrier services, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call. Calling one of these entities shall result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and may possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>YOU MAY CALL ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call anyone you have not had a personal interaction with. Although the scripts are often cartoonish and often outlandish, some of the scripts may be scary or misleading to people who may not be expecting these calls or who cannot get a personal, friendly explanation about the nature of the call. We&rsquo;ve therefore chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction. Calling strangers can result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and would possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE FOR COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to OP Media as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.</span><br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is expected that all users of any part of OP Media will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if OP Media receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.</span><br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Designated Agent</span></h3>

<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Counter Notification</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide OP Media's Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication (preferably via email):</span></p>
<ol>

<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your signature, in physical or electronic form.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

OP Media will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Repeat Infringers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, OP Media will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is OP Media's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works that OP Media determines are reasonable under the circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>VIRTUAL MONEY AND GOODS</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Service may permit the purchase of virtual currency, such as credits, points, and gems (&ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Money</span>&rdquo;), and use of that Virtual Money to purchase virtual object or services (&ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Goods</span>&rdquo;). Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are collectively referred to as &ldquo;Virtual Items.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">License to Virtual Items</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> Your purchase of Virtual Money grants you only a limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Money to access and purchase Virtual Goods in conjunction with your personal, noncommercial use of the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No ownership</span>. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual Items. Any balance of Virtual Items does not reflect any stored value. You agree that Virtual Items have no monetary value and do not constitute actual currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for &ldquo;real&rdquo; money, &ldquo;real&rdquo; goods, or &ldquo;real&rdquo; services from us or anyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Only obtain Virtual Items through official channels</span>. You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Items from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third-party platform, exchange, broker, or other mechanism, unless expressly authorized.&nbsp;Once you acquire a license to Virtual Items, you may not trade or transfer the Virtual Items to another individual or account, unless such functionality is provided to you by us by way of a feature or service, whether inside the Service or through some other method (e.g., a third-party website we authorize). We may cancel any Virtual Item &nbsp;sold, transferred, or exchanged in violation of this Agreement. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited and may result in the termination of your account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Redemption and pricing of Virtual Items</span>. During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you have the option to redeem your Virtual Money for selected Virtual Goods. Pricing and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to change and update our pricing and inventory of Virtual Items. All Virtual Items are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Items are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any unused Items once the transaction has been made.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Purchases by End Users Outside the U.S.</span> Virtual Items may only be purchased and held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Service are permitted. If you live in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from online purchases. However, please note that once you download Virtual Money from us, your right of withdrawal ends.&nbsp;You agree that (a) purchase of Virtual Money involves immediate download of such Content; and (b) you lose your right of withdrawal once your purchase is complete. If you live in the European Union, you will need to ensure your compliance with VAT when required to do so by law. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.&nbsp;We reserve the right to control, regulate, change, or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suspension or cancellation</span>. We may cancel, suspend, or terminate your account and your access to your Virtual Items, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, in situations including, but not limited to, if (a) your account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged into); (b) you fail to comply with this Agreement; (c ) we suspect fraud or misuse by you of Virtual Items; (d) we suspect any other unlawful activity associated with your account; or (e) we are acting to protect the Service, our systems, any of our users, or our reputation. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and will not reimburse or refund, you for any Virtual Items lost due to such cancellation, suspension, or termination. You acknowledge that OP Media is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary.&nbsp;In the case OP Media cancels your account, OP Media will not be required to provide you with prior notice or explanation in respect of such action. Notwithstanding the cancellation of access to your account in any case, you agree you will remain fully liable for any outstanding liability owed to OP Media. OP Media may, where it believes such action is necessary, without notice block IP addresses of any users who OP Media believes have breached that Agreement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span>. We have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Items, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Items entirely, then we will provide notice to you by posting a notice on the Service or through other communications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note to parents</span>. The Services are not intended for use by children under age 13 or persons who have not reached the age of majority under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. &nbsp;Some on-Site content, functionality and actions are available only by purchasing of Virtual Items. &nbsp;If you are a parent, legal guardian and other adult responsible for children in your care, you are fully responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument by the children in your care. &nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and other adults who provide our Software to their children, children in their care or other adults should take precautions to prevent unintended purchases of Virtual Items. Aside from any refund obligations we may be required to honor from the platform the Software is distributed through, we accept ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS on any Virtual Items purchases including those made by children in your care.</span></p>

When you purchase a license to use our Virtual Items, you agree to pay taxes that we or our distribution platform assesses on your purchase. Depending on the jurisdiction, the price may or may not include any applicable VAT.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorrect pricing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">on Virtual Items</span>. If the price or specification published is materially incorrect when you place an order for the Virtual Items those incorrect prices may be honored at our sole discretion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.65;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Billing Disputes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You must notify OP Media of any disputed charges within thirty (30) days of the charge being posted to your account <a href="https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/">through this form</a>. OP Media will attempt to resolve all disputes within 30 days of being notified of a dispute. To the extent OP Media determines, at its sole discretion, that a billing adjustment is warranted, your account will be credited accordingly. If you fail to notify OP Media of a billing dispute as noted above, you will waive all rights to bring any claim regarding the disputed charges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">INDEMNIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold OP Media harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees, fees incurred in settling disputes, and fees incurred enforcing this indemnification provision) we incur in relation to, arising from, or for the purpose of avoiding, any claim or demand from a third party created by your use or, misuse of, or access to the Service including, but not limited to, (i) your violation of this Agreement; (ii) your Content; (iii) your interaction with other Users; (iv) violations of the TCPA or any other telecommunications-related laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">OP Media retains the right to employ OP Media&rsquo;s own counsel. You remain solely responsible for OP Media&rsquo;s defense and must obtain OP Media&rsquo;s written consent to a settlement. You agree to notify OP Media of a pending suit claiming you have violated a third party&rsquo;s intellectual property or other rights. OP Media requires that you confirm your indemnification in case of a lawsuit; failure to do so may be considered a breach of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs shall include the fees and costs related to enforcing this indemnification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>TERMINATION</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">OP Media may terminate, change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) or your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your use of the Service and related Content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>NO WARRANTIES</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You understand and agree that the Service are provided to you "AS IS" and on an "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY BETWEEN YOU AND OP MEDIA WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, IF NO AMOUNT WAS PAID FOR THE SERVICE, OUR LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $500. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OP MEDIA OR OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE. CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE MADE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME (ASSUMED TO BE ONE YEAR).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (I) YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TCPA OR ANY COMMUNICATION OR CONSUMER-PROTECTION RELATED LAW OR REGULATION; (II) THE PARTIES INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">AGREEMENT; (III) NEGLIGENT, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL ACTS OF A PARTY (IV) LOSSES SUFFERED BY A PARTY ARISING OUT OF ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE OTHER PARTY THAT ARE COMMITTED OR OMITTED BY THE OTHER PARTY INTENTIONALLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE OTHER PARTY KNOWS OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS WOULD SPECIFICALLY RESULT IN DAMAGES.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In these cases, OP Media&rsquo;s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For any dispute you have with OP Media, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that OP Media has not been able to resolve a dispute after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, &ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Claims</span>&rdquo;), by binding mediation. If, for some technical, legal, or jurisdictional reason, binding mediation is wholly unavailable, then any dispute shall be resolved through binding arbitration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unless you and OP Media decide otherwise, mediation or arbitration will be conducted in Arlington, VA or Los Angeles, CA unless objectively, unduly burdensome to one party. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative and third-party fees. The award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator shall include costs of mediation/arbitration, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For avoidance of doubt, if there are one or more disputed items that remain unresolved at the end of the mediation, the mediator will render a final and binding decision on those unresolved items. The mediator's decisions shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation, costs include attorney&rsquo;s fees required to enforce the mediator&rsquo;s decision. &nbsp;Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related unauthorized access to the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&rsquo; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE MEDIATOR OR ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OP MEDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>
<p><br class="kix-line-break">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SUBMISSIONS</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Often OP Media will accept solicited and unsolicited ideas, concepts, submissions, and Content through the Service that may not rise to the level of intellectual property protection in the jurisdiction.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For the good and valuable consideration of reviewing the submission and potential of working with OP Media, upon submission you hereby assign all title and interest in the intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright and trademarks) in the materials provided to OP Media and shall execute any documents to perfect those rights if necessary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You acknowledge that OP Media has already had access to and/or may independently create or have created ideas, themes, formats and/or other materials which may be similar or identical to the theme, plot, idea, format or other element of the material being provided by you and you agree that you will not be entitled to any compensation for use of such similar or identical material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You agree to indemnify OP Media from and against any and all claims, expenses, losses, or liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and punitive damages) that may be asserted against OP Media in connection with material provided by you to OP Media or provided to you by OP Media.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
