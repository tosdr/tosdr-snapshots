<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Embedly LLC (&ldquo;Embedly&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) provides access to and use of pro.embed.ly, api.embed.ly, and related websites (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;), the Embedly application programming interfaces (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;), Embedly proprietary technology, software code, content and other products and services offered by Embedly (collectively, the "Services") subject to these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). By using the Services, you consent to these Terms, the Embedly <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and subsequent changes to these Terms. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, documentation, terms, or rules, which will be posted in connection with such features; all such guidelines, documentation, terms and rules are incorporated into these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. Your right to use the Site and the Services is expressly conditioned upon your assent to all of these Terms, to the exclusion of all other terms.</p>
<p>We may modify these Terms and the Embedly <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> at any time and you agree that such modifications are effective and binding upon you immediately upon your use of the Services following the posting of the modified version.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility.</strong> You certify to Embedly that if you are an individual you are at least 13 years of age and that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are accessing the Services on behalf of an entity you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind the entity to these Terms. You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services, and take full responsibility for the selection and use and use of the Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access and use the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions. You are solely responsible for complying with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Service. Embedly may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Just a Pass-Through. </strong>You understand that the Services provide you with the ability to link to and display media and information from third party providers (collectively, &ldquo;Third Party Media&rdquo;) and that you are solely responsible for the use of such Third Party Media and any such information that you intentionally or unintentionally communicate to others. Embedly (and the Services) is only a pass through, or intermediary; whereby, the end developer is responsible for adhering to the terms of service for each provider of Third Party Media.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Requirements, License Grants and Restrictions on Use.</strong></p>
<a name="general"></a>
<ol>

You agree to use the API only as outlined in the documentation provided on the Site. You may not install or use the API for any other purpose without Embedly&rsquo;s prior written consent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrictions</strong>. Except as expressly and unambiguously authorized under these Terms, you may not (i) use the Services, API or other tools, services, media, applications or content provided by Embedly in order to create any product or service that permits the linking or display of media, competes with or is intended to replace the Services; or (ii) copy, rent, lease, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, disassemble, reverse engineer or decompile (except to the limited extent expressly authorized by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of the Services or API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changes to APIs</strong>. Embedly reserves the right to continually review, evaluate, terminate or suspend all uses of the API. Embedly reserves the right in its sole discretion (for any reason or for no reason) and at any time to change, suspend or discontinue the Embedly API and/or suspend or terminate your rights under these Terms to access, use and/or display the API by posting a notice on the Sites or by sending you an email.</p></li>

<li><a name="ip"></a><p><strong>Intellectual Property.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>All APIs and Services are the property of Embedly and its licensors. <strong>The Services are protected by federal and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws. </strong>You shall not remove any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property or proprietary notice or legend contained on the Site or Services. Any rights not expressly granted by these Terms are reserved by Embedly and its licensors.</p></li>
<li><p>All trademarks and logos used on these Services are the trademarks, service marks or logos of their respective owners. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right of ownership of any trademarks to you. Further, nothing on these Services shall be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise any license or right to use any trademark used or displayed on the Services, without the express written permission of Embedly or the trademark owner.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Links to Third Party Sites.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Services may contain links to websites operated by other parties as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, music, sound, video, information, applications, software and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties (&ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;). Use of Third Party Sites is strictly at your own risk including, but not limited to, any risks associated with destructive viruses. If you decide to utilize the services and access the Third Party Sites, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that our terms and policies no longer govern. You are responsible for viewing and abiding by the terms and conditions of use and the privacy statements of the other websites. Specifically, if you use Embedly to embed YouTube Videos, you agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">YouTube Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> because Embedly utilizes YouTube API Services.</p></li>
<li><p class="uppercase">WE DO NOT ENDORSE, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROMOTED, OFFERED OR PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES. WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO, AND DO NOT MONITOR, ANY LINKS POSTED, TRANSACTION BETWEEN USERS AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY SUCH DEALINGS.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use at Your Own Risk.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you decide to download and/or or use the Services, API, add-ons, then you do so at your own discretion and risk. We make commercially reasonable efforts to make certain that the Service is compatible with many systems, but Embedly does not guarantee it. That means you are solely responsible for any damages to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download or use of an Embedly Service.</p></li>
<li><p class="uppercase">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT EMBEDLY PROVIDES THE SITE, API AND SERVICES ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS AND DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY FOR UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE IN TRADE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR THE FUNCTIONS OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THEREBY WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a name="ll"></a><p class="uppercase"><strong>Limitation of Liability. </strong>Embedly shall not be liable to you for any direct, special, exemplayry, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages including, without limitation, loss of revenue or anticipated profits, lost business, data or sales, or cost of substitute services (even if you have advised Embedly of the possibility of such damages). Embedly&rsquo;s cumulative liability relating to your use of the site, API and services (regardless of its basis), shall not exceed the greater of (I) amounts that you paid to us in the previous six months and (II) $100. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. You acknowledge and agree that the limitations of Embedly's liability are (a) reasonable in light of your ability to use the Services at the fees charged by Embedly (if any), and (b) essential and fundamental parts of these terms which are necessary to induce Embedly to enter into these Terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indemnity.</strong> You will indemnify and hold Embedly, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand due to or arising out of your access to or use of the Services, your use of Third Party Media or other content that you link, submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services, your violation of these Terms, your infringement, or the infringement by any third party using your registration information, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity or your violation of any law or the rights of another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fees and Payment.</strong> Embedly reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain features of the Service. Should you elect to subscribe to such features, you shall pay all applicable fees in connection with such features in accordance with the then-current price list and payment terms and conditions. Embedly reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon 10 days prior notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Site. Use of the Service by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p></li>
<li><a name="misc"></a><p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Embedly shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Embedly&rsquo;s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Embedly&rsquo;s prior written consent. Embedly may transfer, assign or delegate these Terms and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that these Terms, together with the <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="/legal/copyright">Copyright Policy</a> and any other operating guidelines, rules, documentation, policies and procedures posted through the Services comprise the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Embedly in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to the Embedly that is required or permitted by these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when sent by confirmed e-mail to support[at]embed.ly.</p></li>
