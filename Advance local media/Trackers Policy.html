                to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of 
                these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your 
                device (e.g., IP address). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your 
                computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or 
                Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages 
                you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; 
                determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; 
                deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve 
                on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.

            <p>
                The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the 
                effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, 
                approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device 
                for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics

                need to repeat the process. However, if you have created an account to log in across several of our apps and/or websites, 
                we will make reasonable efforts to apply your opt-out request to each of those apps and websites.

                                    described above, the Opt-Out will <span class="underline">only be applied on the specific market's website</span>. 
                                    If you want to Opt-Out on our other websites, you will need to go to that website, access the “Your 
                                    Privacy Choices” button/link and follow the Opt-Out process described above.

                    user-initiated browser based opt-out preference signals. Note that the Global Privacy Control is currently only 
                    applicable to opt-outs from websites. For mobile apps, please follow the instructions above.

                California's "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code §§ 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites 
                and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal 
                of content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Products and Services that is 
                directed to California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content 
                by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email or as described below. In response to your request, we may elect 
                to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content 
                may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the
