Fees and Payment</h2></div>
<ol class="sc-1k59q9y-0 kMGrRb">
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Paid Services.</strong> Some portions of the Issuu Service may have fees associated with them (each, a <strong>&quot;Paid Service&quot;</strong>). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the Issuu Service at any time. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. One such Paid Service may be Issuu’s Digital Sales Feature, further described in Section 5(f) below.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Free Trial.</strong> Issuu may make available a 14-day trial for a Paid Service without charge to you (<strong>&quot;Free Trial&quot;</strong>). You may be required to enter a Payment Method (defined below) in order to register for a Free Trial. The applicable Paid Service will automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in accordance with Section 3(d), at the end of the Free Trial unless you log into your Issuu account and cancel the Paid Service before the end of the Free Trial.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Payment Information.</strong> You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your Issuu Service account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize Issuu or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you (<strong>&quot;Payment Method&quot;</strong>), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Subscriptions.</strong> For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:<!-- -->
<ol class="sc-1k59q9y-0 kMGrRb">
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ">Your <strong>&quot;Subscription Billing Date&quot;</strong> is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ">For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the Subscription Billing Date for that month).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Termination of Subscriptions</strong>. For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period&#x27;s (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Third Parties and Fee Collection.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Issuu may be shared by Issuu with companies who work on Issuu’s behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to Issuu and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Issuu account upon demand, (ii) Issuu may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) Issuu reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more Issuu Services or your account with Issuu. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the Issuu Service before termination.</li><style data-product-legal="true" data-styled-version="6.1.11"></style>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Refunds.</strong> Any fees charged to your account are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms.  If you or we cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to a refund of any subscription fees that were already charged for a subscription period that has already begun. You agree to submit any dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to Issuu within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of Issuu.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the Issuu Services, including sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to Issuu the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that Issuu is obligated to collect such taxes, Issuu will charge your Payment Method or otherwise add the applicable to your billing account.</li>

Arbitration Agreement; Class Action Waiver; Governing Law</h2></div>
<ol class="sc-1k59q9y-0 kMGrRb">
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Issuu in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Issuu agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. <strong>You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Issuu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong><style data-product-legal="true" data-styled-version="6.1.11"></style></li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Exceptions.</strong> You and Issuu agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Arbitration.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Issuu will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Issuu.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Arbitration Notice; Process.</strong> If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Issuu, by certified mail or FedEx (signature required), a written notice of your claim addressed to: Legal Dept., Issuu, 131 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301, USA. If Issuu elects to seek arbitration, it will send a written notice to the email address you provided to Issuu for your account. An arbitration notice, whether sent by you or by Issuu, must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. You and Issuu each agree to use good faith efforts to directly resolve any claim, but if we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Issuu may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During any arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Issuu or you must not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Issuu will pay you: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B) the last written settlement amount offered by Issuu in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (C) $1,000, whichever is highest.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Fees.</strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Issuu will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the city of your billing address provided to Issuu as part of your account registration, or, if no city was provided, in the AAA office nearest to you, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Issuu for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Modifications.</strong> If Issuu makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Issuu&#x27;s address for notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of Issuu’s notice to you of the change, in which case your account with Issuu will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>No Class Actions. YOU AND ISSUU AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and Issuu agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER ABOVE WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt- Out Deadline”). You may opt out of the waiver by mailing written notification to Issuu at the address stated at the end of these Terms. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not agree to the class action waiver. Your decision to opt-out will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Issuu. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid. Neither you, nor any other user of the Issuu Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Enforceability.</strong> If any or all of this arbitration agreement provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration agreement provision will be void and, in that case, you and Issuu both agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</li>
<li class="sc-1k59q9y-2 kMdrrQ"><strong>Governing Law; Venue.</strong> These Terms and any action arising out of these Terms or your use of the Service, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and Issuu agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.</li>

THE UPDATED TERMS OF SERVICE WILL BE EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2021. IF YOU USE OUR SERVICE AFTER THAT DATE, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO THE UPDATED TERMS.**\n\n**[SEE THE PREVIOUS TERMS HERE.](/legal/terms/2021august31)**\n\n### Consent to Marketing\n\nBy accepting these terms as stated above, you hereby consent:\n\n- To receive or  continue to receive Issuu ApS and Issuu Inc’s e-mail newsletters including news on new features and new or updated publications.\n- You may opt-out at any time using the opt-out button in the e-mails or by changing your  accounts settings when logged in.\n\n### Eligibility and Assent to Terms\n\nWelcome to Issuu! The following Terms of Service for the Issuu.com website, software applications made available by Issuu from the website or via a third party **(\&quot;Software\&quot;)**, and any application programming interface **(\&quot;API\&quot;)** or other technology or services made available by Issuu via the website or Software (collectively, the **\&quot;Issuu Service\&quot;**) is a legal contract between you, either an individual of at least 13 years of age or a single legal entity (**\&quot;You\&quot;** or, collectively, **\&quot;Users\&quot;**), and Issuu regarding your use of the Issuu Service (**\&quot;Terms\&quot;**). The Issuu Service is not available to persons under the age of 13 or to any users previously removed from the Issuu Service by Issuu. Also, if you are between age 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction your legal guardian must review and agree to these Terms.\n\nThese Terms provide that all disputes between you and Issuu will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the [\&quot;Arbitration Agreement\&quot;](#arbitration-agreement-class-action-waiver-governing-law) section below for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Issuu.\n\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU (OR, IF THE USER IS BELOW THE AGE OF MAJORITY, YOU, AS LEGAL GUARDIAN OF THE USER) HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY FUTURE MODIFICATIONS. IF AT ANY TIME YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF THE ISSUU SERVICE. IF YOU ARE USING OR OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH ISSUU ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY, ENTITY, OR ORGANIZATION (COLLECTIVELY, A **\&quot;SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION\&quot;**) THEN YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ORGANIZATION TO THESE TERMS AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION.\n\nBY CHECKING THE \&quot;I ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE\&quot; BUTTON OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING ANY PORTION OF THE ISSUU SERVICE, YOU ASSENT TO AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION (OR, IF THE USER IS BETWEEN 13 AND THE AGE OF MAJORITY, YOU, ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN OF THE USER) AND HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM THE ISSUU SERVICE.\n\n**Important Note:** These Terms contain a class action waiver, which affects your rights under these Terms and with respect to any dispute you may have with Issuu. You may opt out of the class action waiver as provided below.\n\n## 1. Modification\n\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time by posting the amended Terms on our website. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. We may provide additional notice, such as an email message or a message within the Issuu Service, of any material changes. Unless we state otherwise, changes are effective seven (7) days following the date posted on our website. If you continue to use the Issuu Service after the effective date, you agree to the changes. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.\n\nWe may also change or discontinue the Issuu Service in whole or in part at any time, in our sole discretion. Such changes may include, but not be limited to, changes to the amount of storage space you have on the Issuu Service at any time. Your continued use of the Issuu Service indicates your agreement to the changes. If Issuu discontinues a Paid Service (as defined in Section 3(a) below), Issuu may either (a) provide a pro-rata refund of fees you pre-paid for such Paid Service or (b) continue to provide such Paid Service to you until the end of your then-current subscription for such Paid Service.\n\n## 2. Additional Terms\n\nYour use of the Issuu Service is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Issuu Service or certain features of the Issuu Service that we may post on or link to on the Issuu Service (the **\&quot;Additional Terms\&quot;**), such as end-user license agreements for any downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to particular features or content on the Issuu Service, subject to Section 1\\. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.\n\n## 3. Fees and Payment\n\n- **Paid Services.** Some portions of the Issuu Service may have fees associated with them (each, a **\&quot;Paid Service\&quot;**). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the Issuu Service at any time. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. One such Paid Service may be Issuu’s Digital Sales Feature, further described in Section 5(f) below.\n- **Free Trial.** Issuu may make available a 14-day trial for a Paid Service without charge to you (**\&quot;Free Trial\&quot;**). You may be required to enter a Payment Method (defined below) in order to register for a Free Trial. The applicable Paid Service will automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in accordance with Section 3(d), at the end of the Free Trial unless you log into your Issuu account and cancel the Paid Service before the end of the Free Trial.\n- **Payment Information.** You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your Issuu Service account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize Issuu or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you (**\&quot;Payment Method\&quot;**), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.\n- **Subscriptions.** For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:\n    - Your **\&quot;Subscription Billing Date\&quot;** is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable.\n    - For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the Subscription Billing Date for that month).\n- **Termination of Subscriptions**. For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period&#x27;s (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).\n- **Third Parties and Fee Collection.** You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Issuu may be shared by Issuu with companies who work on Issuu’s behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to Issuu and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Issuu account upon demand, (ii) Issuu may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) Issuu reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more Issuu Services or your account with Issuu. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the Issuu Service before termination.\n- **Refunds.** Any fees charged to your account are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms.  If you or we cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to a refund of any subscription fees that were already charged for a subscription period that has already begun. You agree to submit any dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to Issuu within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of Issuu.\n- **Taxes.** You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the Issuu Services, including sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to Issuu the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that Issuu is obligated to collect such taxes, Issuu will charge your Payment Method or otherwise add the applicable to your billing account.\n\n## 4. User Accounts\n\nYou may browse the Issuu.com website without creating an account, subject to these Terms. In order to use the full features of the Issuu Service, you must register for an account or log into the Issuu Service using your Facebook login or login to another third party social media platform that we support (**\&quot;Integrated Service\&quot;**). Your use of any account with an Integrated Service is subject to any terms, conditions, and policies, including privacy policies, of that Integrated Service. When you use the Issuu Service to upload, download, or purchase content or any products, services, or information from Issuu, you may be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer or device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree that the information you provide to Issuu on registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID, password, or any credit, debit or charge card number, if applicable), then you must immediately notify Issuu. You are solely liable for the losses incurred by Issuu or others due to any unauthorized use of your Issuu Service account.\n\n## 5.

Without limiting any other of your obligations under these Terms, as a publisher you agree that your use of the Digital Sales Feature will be subject to (a) the terms of Appendix 1 hereto, (b) a valid user agreement between you and such readers and subscribers and (c) all applicable laws and regulations.\n    - **Customer terms.** If you are a customer of the Digital Sales Feature (i.e., a reader who purchases access to a third party publisher’s publication via Issuu), you agree (a) to comply with the publisher’s terms regarding access to and use of such publication; and (b) to not make any claim against Issuu or hold Issuu liable in any way for your access and use of, or inability to access and use, such publication.\n- **Reservation of Rights.** Issuu reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible for each of your User Submissions and the consequences of uploading them.

In addition, although Issuu has no obligation to remove, screen, edit, or monitor any Pre-Publication Assets, Issuu reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, edit, or disable any Pre-Publication Asset at any time and for any reason.\n- **No Endorsement.** Further, you understand that when using the Issuu Service you will be exposed to Published Content from a variety of sources, and that Issuu is not responsible for the accuracy, content, usefulness, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Published Content.

For clarity, Issuu does not permit copyright infringing activities on the Issuu Service.\n- **Referral Partners.** Issuu may as part of the Issuu Service allow you to enable certain third parties such as printing houses that have contracted with Issuu (each, a “Referral Partner”) to upload User Submissions on your behalf.

Without limiting any other provision in these Terms, you understand and agree that Issuu shall have no responsibility for the content or quality of any User Submission provided by a Referral Partner.

Your rights under these Terms are contingent on your compliance with this provision.\n\n## 19. Arbitration Agreement; Class Action Waiver; Governing Law\n\n- **Generally.** In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Issuu in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Issuu agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. **You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Issuu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.**\n- **Exceptions.** You and Issuu agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.\n- **Arbitration.** Any arbitration between you and Issuu will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \&quot;AAA Rules\&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (\&quot;AAA\&quot;), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Issuu.\n- **Arbitration Notice; Process.** If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Issuu, by certified mail or FedEx (signature required), a written notice of your claim addressed to: Legal Dept., Issuu, 131 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301, USA. If Issuu elects to seek arbitration, it will send a written notice to the email address you provided to Issuu for your account. An arbitration notice, whether sent by you or by Issuu, must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. You and Issuu each agree to use good faith efforts to directly resolve any claim, but if we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Issuu may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During any arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Issuu or you must not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Issuu will pay you: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B) the last written settlement amount offered by Issuu in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (C) $1,000, whichever is highest.\n- **Fees.** If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Issuu will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the city of your billing address provided to Issuu as part of your account registration, or, if no city was provided, in the AAA office nearest to you, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Issuu for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n- **Modifications.** If Issuu makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Issuu&#x27;s address for notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of Issuu’s notice to you of the change, in which case your account with Issuu will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.\n- **No Class Actions. YOU AND ISSUU AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and Issuu agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER ABOVE WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt- Out Deadline”). You may opt out of the waiver by mailing written notification to Issuu at the address stated at the end of these Terms. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not agree to the class action waiver. Your decision to opt-out will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Issuu. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid. Neither you, nor any other user of the Issuu Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.\n- **Enforceability.** If any or all of this arbitration agreement provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration agreement provision will be void and, in that case, you and Issuu both agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\n- **Governing Law; Venue.** These Terms and any action arising out of these Terms or your use of the Service, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and Issuu agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.\n\n## 20. Government Terms\n\nIf you use the Issuu Service in an official capacity for a federal, state or local government or government agency in the United States, the following modifications of these Terms apply solely to that official use:\n\n- **Indemnification.** The terms of Section 15 will apply to you only to the extent expressly permitted by your jurisdiction’s laws.\n- **Arbitration.** The terms of Section 19(a) – (h) do not apply to your official use of the Service.\n- **Governing Law.** The terms of Section 19(i) will apply only to the extent expressly permitted by your jurisdiction’s laws.\n\n## 21. Miscellaneous\n\n- The failure of Issuu to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Issuu. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Issuu without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void. The use of the word “included” is intended to mean “included but not limited to” unless expressly stated otherwise. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including Sections 1 through 3 and 11 through 20\\. Heading references are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements incorporated by reference, are the entire agreement between you and Issuu relating to the subject matter described in these Terms and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by Issuu as set forth above.\n- **YOU AND ISSUU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE ISSUU SERVICE OR THESE TERMS MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.**\n\n**Contact information:**\n&gt; Issuu, Inc.\n&gt; 131 Lytton Ave\n&gt; Palo Alto, CA 94301\n&gt; USA\n\n&gt; [contact@issuu.com](mailto:contact@issuu.com)\n\n# Appendix 1 - Issuu Digital Sales Terms\n\nIssuu’s Digital Sales service (“Digital Sales”) is intended for publishers who wish to charge a fee to consumers of their User Submissions (also referred to herein as “Publications”) via the Issuu Service (“End Users”). Your use of Digital Sales is subject to these Issuu Digital Sales Terms (the “Digital Sales Terms”) any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to Digital Sales or certain features of Digital Sales that we may post on or link to on the Issuu Service.\n\nThese Digital Sales Terms are Additional Terms as defined in Issuu’s Terms of Service, currently located at http://issuu.com/legal/terms (the “Terms of Service” or “TOS”). All capitalized terms used in these Digital Sales Terms and not defined herein shall have the definition set forth in the TOS.\n\n## 1. Paid Purchases\nAccess to your Publications for which you charge End Users a fee is referred to in these Digital Sales Terms as a “Paid Purchase.” A Paid Purchase may be a purchase of a single edition of a Publication or a subscription to a Publication (a “Paid Subscription”). It is your responsibility to set the terms of Paid Purchases, such as duration, price, etc., and to contract directly with End Users regarding such terms via an enforceable agreement (“End User Agreement”). You understand and agree that all End Users must have an active and valid account to use the Issuu Service; your agreement with End Users shall require the End User to confirm that and shall not modify or effect in any way the End User’s account with Issuu.\n\n## 2. Pricing, Delivery and Updates\nYou are solely responsible for setting the price of a Paid Purchase. You will be required to permit End Users to access a free preview of your Publications. After a Paid Purchase for a Publication is purchased by an End User, you may delete the preview and suspend the Paid Purchase, however, Issuu may, in its discretion, continue to serve the content of the Paid Purchase for up to one (1) year and following such time may provide such content to the End User in pdf or other static format. You may re-upload a Publication that has been removed or update an existing Publication (such re-load or update is referred to as an “Update”). Any Update you provide may be provided without notice to End Users with existing Paid Purchases. If you do not want End Users with existing Paid Purchases to receive an Update, you must to upload the Update as a new, separate and distinct file and not as an update to a file for an existing Publication.\n\n## 3. Issuu Fee\nYou shall pay to Issuu a fee for each Paid Purchase as set forth in these Digital Sales Terms (the “Issuu Fee”). As Digital Sales is currently structured, the Issuu Fee will be paid via the process described in Section 4 below.\n\nIssuu may in its discretion allow you to participate in a free trial of Digital Sales The time period of such free trial is referred to as the “Trial Period.”  During the Trial Period, you may sell Paid Subscriptions.  If at the end of the Trial Period you do not continue the paid Digital Sales service in standard (paying) mode, Issuu will:  (a) convert any of your subscriptions to Publications to single edition purchases of the Publications; (b) revert all of your Paid Subscriptions to free; and (c) keep the Issuu Fee from your sales of Paid Subscriptions during the Trial Period.\n\nClauses (a) – (c) above are referred to as the “Downgrade Process.”  Issuu may, in its discretion, apply the Downgrade Process to a Publication in the event that you choose to end Digital Sales with respect to that Publication.\n\n## 4. Billing and Payment Process\nIssuu will use a third party billing provider such as Stripe (the “Third Party Billing Platform” or the “Platform”) to facilitate the payment flow for Digital Sales. Accordingly, Issuu will have a “parent” Platform account with connected “child” Platform accounts for each publisher using Digital Sales, including you. You will create your own Platform “child” account, which will enable you to receive money, and you will be required to grant access to Issuu to permit Issuu to charge End Users fees for the Paid Purchases on your behalf. End User billing information will be stored on both the Issuu “parent” account and your “child” account. However, no confidential credit card information will be made available to Issuu.\nA Paid Purchase transaction will be processed via the following steps:\n\nStep 1: End User purchases a Paid Purchase via a web page on the Issuu Service that is connected to the Platform\n\nStep 2: The Platform processes the order by sending the appropriate amounts (the “Publisher Proceeds”) to you after (a) transferring the Issuu Fee to Issuu’s Platform account and (b) deducting the Platform’s fee for the transaction.\n\n## 5. End User Agreement Requirements\nYou agree that Issuu shall have no responsibility for billing End Users and that Issuu shall have no liability to you or to any End User for any error in billing or failure to bill for Paid Purchases. You shall be responsible for, and shall appropriately document in the End User Agreement, the billing relationship between you and End Users for Paid Purchases. Without limiting the foregoing, you shall ensure that the End User Agreement expressly states that Issuu will not be the merchant of record for Paid Purchases. Your End User Agreement and your treatment of End Users (including but not limited to the collection, use and disclosure of their information) shall comply will all applicable laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, you shall ensure that you publish and comply with a privacy policy that clearly informs End Users of how their information, including but not limited to billing information, will be collected, used and disclosed and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. Taxes\nIf the End User is located in a jurisdiction for which sales tax, value added tax or other tax (each a “Tax”) is required to be levied on such End User’s Paid Purchase, you are responsible for adding the appropriate amount of Tax to the price that you set for such Paid Purchase. You are also responsible for all other taxes, including taxes on your net income. In addition to your indemnification obligations in the TOS, you shall fully indemnify Issuu for any failure to correctly charge and collect the appropriate applicable Tax or for any tax liability of Issuu resulting from your negligence or intentional misconduct or from your breach of these Digital Sales Terms.\n\n## 7. Refunds\nIssuu will forward to you requests by End Users for exchanges, refunds and similar requests. You are responsible for determining the appropriate resolution of each such request. You will not receive Publisher Proceeds for orders for which refunds are issued.\n\n## 8. Access Codes\n- **For Publishers**\n    - As a publisher you may choose to generate free or discounted access codes (“Access Codes”) for use by customers.\n    - Access Codes may grant Users free access or discounted access to the applicable content.\n    - Each Access Code must (a) have an expiry date (to the extent permitted by law) and (b) state whether or not the Access Code can be used only once or an unlimited number of times.\n    - Publisher may distribute the Access Codes as you choose, for example, to your print subscribers or via email to selected individuals.\n    - Without limiting any obligations under the Issuu Terms of Service, publishers must comply with all applicable laws related to the creation, use, distribution, and redemption of Access Codes, including all applicable privacy and gift certificate laws and regulations.\n- **For Users**\n    - Users of the Issuu Service who receive an Access Code may redeem them via:\n        - https://issuu.com/store/code, which subsequently redirects the user to the publication and the option to access it for free or at the discounted price, or\n        - a URL provided by the publisher, which will send the User directly to the publication.\n    - For Access Codes entitling the User to free access, instead of inputting credit card details or other appropriate Payment Method, Users must enter the Access Code.\n    - For Access Codes entitling the User to discounted access, Users must enter the Access Code in addition to credit card details or other appropriate Payment Method.\n    - In the event that a User inputting an Access Code does not have an account for the Paid Service, Issuu will create such an account for that User as part of this process of redeeming such Access Code.\n    - Please note that Access Codes have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash or other currency.\n\n## 9. General Provisions\nThese Digital Sales Terms, together with the TOS into which they are incorporated, are the complete agreement between you and Issuu with respect to Digital Sales. If a provision of these Digital Sales Terms conflicts with a provision of the TOS, such provision of these Digital Sales Terms shall control, but only with respect to Digital Sales.\n&quot;}" id="initial-data" type="text/plain" data-reactroot=""></script><style data-product-legal="true" data-styled-version="6.1.11"></style>
