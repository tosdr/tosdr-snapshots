AGODA SERVICES</strong></p>\n<p>6.1 The terms in this Section B apply to Agoda&rsquo;s provision of its  Travel Product booking facilitation-related Services through the Platform.  Where the Travel Product booking facilitation-related Services are provided by  any Partner or made via a Partner&rsquo;s platform, please refer to that Partner&rsquo;s  respective terms and conditions of use and privacy policy instead as these will  govern the relation between you and that Partner. For the avoidance of doubt,  where the Travel Product is provided by a Partner, your booking through the  Platform is an offer to book a reservation (e.g., for Accommodations, Flights  or a rental car, you are making a request to book a reservation with the  Partner that is subject to acceptance by the Partner before it becomes a  binding transaction) at the price listed on the Platform for such Travel  Product on such other terms and conditions notified to you by the Partner at  the time of booking, which shall become a binding contract when your booking is  accepted by the Partner and will be subject to the Partner&rsquo;s terms and  conditions. Where applicable, the Partner will indicate the acceptance of such  Travel Product booking via an e-mail confirmation to you. In these cases, we  will provide your payment information to the relevant Partner to process your  payment and confirm your booking. The Partner reserves the right to reject  bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>6.2 Unless otherwise stated, all of our Travel Product booking  facilitation-related Services are provided by Agoda Company Pte. Ltd., which is  a private limited liability company, incorporated under the laws of Singapore,  having its registered address at 30 Cecil Street, Prudential Tower #19-08,  Singapore 049712 and is registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory  Authority of Singapore under company registration number 200506877R.</p>\n<p>6.3 Please note that Agoda does not organize any ground transportation.  Where ground transportation is offered, this can be organized by and offered by  or on behalf of the Travel Supplier or a Partner, not Agoda. Agoda does not  assume any liability for the quality, safety, frequency, or service levels of  such transportation services. Where your Confirmed Booking includes a  self-transfer, you are responsible for the transfer and, subject to the terms  of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/flights/info/agodaguarantee\">Agoda.com  Guarantee</a>&nbsp;(if available), Agoda does not assume any liability in  relation to the self-transfer. Please verify with&nbsp;<a href=\"/info/contact.html\">Customer Service</a>&nbsp;which  extra fees are (not) included for self-transfers and ground transportation.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>7. BOOKINGS</strong></p>\n<p>7.1 When making a booking for any Travel Product through our  Platform, that booking is made directly with the Travel Supplier(s) named on  the booking page. Our Platform only acts as a facilitator of such bookings. We  do not provide, own or control any of the Travel Products that you can access  through our Platform and we have no obligation to provide or operate the Travel  Products. The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by the  Travel Suppliers either directly or as an agent. The Travel Suppliers are  responsible for their respective Travel Products. Your interaction with any  Travel Supplier through our Platform is at your own risk. Agoda does not bear  any responsibility should anything go wrong during your travel or your use of  the Travel Product.</p>\n<p>7.2 A credit card, debit card, digital wallet or such other payment  method as we may from time to time accept (&ldquo;<strong>Payment Instrument</strong>&rdquo;) will be  required in order to make a booking for a Travel Product through our Platform.</p>\n<p>7.3 When you submit a booking through our Platform, you make an  offer to book the specified Travel Product(s) subject to these Terms (&ldquo;<strong>Booking  Request</strong>&rdquo;). The Travel Product shall be supplied by the Travel Supplier to you  and the terms and conditions applicable to that Travel Product shall be between  you and the Travel Supplier and shall be a separate binding contract pursuant  to these Terms between you and the relevant Travel Supplier once accepted by  such Travel Supplier, communicated to Agoda, and subsequently communicated to  you via a confirmation email from Agoda (&ldquo;<strong>Confirmed Booking</strong>&rdquo;). You  acknowledge that the &ldquo;thank you page&rdquo; shown after the submission of your  Booking Request does not indicate a Confirmed Booking and only indicates that  your Booking Request has been received by Agoda for processing.</p>\n<p>7.4 In some cases, we may provide you with a confirmation number in  the confirmation email (&ldquo;<strong>Booking Confirmation Number</strong>&rdquo;). Depending on the  policy of the Travel Supplier, the confirmation may also contain a voucher for  redemption (&ldquo;<strong>Booking Voucher</strong>&rdquo;). Neither we nor the Travel Supplier will  be responsible for Booking Confirmation Numbers or Booking Vouchers that are  lost, stolen or destroyed.</p>\n<p>7.5 The relevant Travel Supplier(s) may impose additional terms and  conditions, rules and restrictions (each a &ldquo;<strong>Travel Supplier Terms</strong>&rdquo;) that  will be applicable to your Confirmed Booking, including in relation to changes,  cancellations and refunds. You will be provided with the name of each Travel  Supplier and in some cases, the applicable Travel Supplier Terms or a link to  their Travel Supplier Terms, during the booking process. As the Travel Supplier  Terms applicable for each Travel Product may vary, you should ensure that you  fully understand and accept all of the applicable Travel Supplier Terms before  completing your booking. If you are booking on behalf of other persons, you are  required to ensure that they are aware of and agree to the applicable Travel  Supplier Terms. If you fail to comply with the Travel Supplier Terms, the  Travel Supplier has a right to refuse or cancel your booking without offering any  refunds. For enquiries about the Travel Supplier&rsquo;s products and services or its  Travel Supplier Terms, please contact the Travel Supplier directly.</p>\n<p>7.6 Except where prohibited by local law, Agoda has the right to  reject any Booking Request, and cancel any Confirmed Booking, including on  behalf of the Travel Supplier, or any part thereof, without reason. If you have  already made payment, we shall refund you the amounts paid in respect of such  rejected or cancelled parts in accordance with our&nbsp;<a href=\"/info/agoda-policies.html#5\">Refund Policy</a>,  unless:</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.1 you are in breach of these Terms or any applicable law;</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.2 the Travel Supplier Terms do not allow for refunds; or</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.3 Agoda deems in its sole discretion that you are not entitled to  a refund due to reasons including but not limited to suspected fraud or abuse.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>8. PRICING, ADDITIONAL CHARGES AND TAXES</strong></p>\n<a name=\"12\"></a>\n<p><strong>8.1 Currency selection and effects</strong></p>\n<p>The Platform allows you to make bookings with Travel Suppliers around the world. Due to our international user base and the global nature of our listings, certain options are available to you to choose the currency displayed to you on the Platform (\"<strong>Display Currency</strong>”) and to choose for the currency in which you are charged for a booking (\"<strong>Charge Currency</strong>”).</p> \n<p>Your default Display Currency is based on your IP address. You can select your preferred Display Currency by clicking the currency code (e.g. USD, AUD) shown in the top right corner of any page, or in Account Settings.</p> \n<p>Before you select your Charge Currency on the booking form/confirmation page, the Platform shows you estimated prices of your booking in your Display Currency for your convenient reference only. Where relevant, Agoda uses the then-current Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate to calculate those estimated prices of your booking. The price you pay for a booking will depend on your selected booking type, Payment Instrument, Display Currency, Charge Currency, and any applicable credits and discounts, among other things.</p>  \n<p>Agoda determines your default Charge Currency based on the default currency of the Payment Instrument details that you enter on the booking form/confirmation page. You are also provided the option to set your Charge Currency as the currency that the Travel Supplier uses for its Travel Product listings with Agoda (“<strong>Product Currency</strong>”).</p>\n</p>\n<style>\ntable \n{\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  width: 100%;\n  border-spacing: 20px;\n}\nth, td {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n  padding-bottom: 20px;\n}\nth {\n  text-align: left;\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\ntr {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\n</style>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>If you select a <strong>“Pay Now” booking …</strong></td>\n    <td>Agoda will calculate the price for your booking using the then-current Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate.

However, payment is due in the Travel Supplier’s currency.</p>\n<p>If you pay the Travel Supplier in a different currency, or with a Payment Instrument that uses a different currency, the actual amount that you will be charged for your booking will depend on the exchange rate(s) used by the Travel Supplier and/or your card issuer. These factors are outside of Agoda’s control.</p>\n</td>\n</table>\n<p>Agoda updates its Bloomberg Generic Composite Rates regularly, and generally on a daily basis.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>Payment Instrument provider fees</strong></p>\n<style>\ntable {\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  width: 100%;\n}\ntr {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\nth, td {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n  padding-bottom: 20px;\n}\n</style>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>If you select a Charge Currency that is not the default currency of the Payment Instrument …</td>\n    <td>Your Payment Instrument provider (for example, the bank issuing the payment card which you use to pay):\n<ul>\n<li>may charge you additional fees, such as international transaction fees; and</li>\n<li>will determine the applicable exchange rate when the transaction is applied to your account.

The charge for  Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without  limitation, the amount Agoda pays the Travel Supplier and the location and type  of the Travel Supplier and/or Travel Product and may include a fee that Agoda  retains.</p>\n<p>&ensp;In relation to Flights or Accommodations,  these Taxes and Fees may include a fee for the facilitation services provided  by Agoda in relation to your Booking (&ldquo;<strong>Agoda Booking Fee</strong>&rdquo;). Except where  expressly prohibited by law, the Agoda Booking Fee is non-refundable.</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.3 In relation to Flights and Accommodations, these Taxes and Fees  include an estimated amount to recover the amount Agoda pays on your behalf to  the relevant Travel Supplier(s) in connection with your booking for taxes owed  by the respective Travel Supplier(s), or Agoda as the case may be, in respect  of their service to you, including, without limitation, sales and use tax,  occupancy tax, room tax, departure, airport use, terminal, aviation security,  aviation insurance and fuel surcharges and taxes, sales tax, service tax,  excise tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, consumption tax and/or  other similar taxes.</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.4 For bookings involving Travel Products located in certain  jurisdictions, the Taxes and Fees amount may also include government-imposed  service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but  required by law to be collected by the relevant Travel Supplier, or Agoda as  the case may be.</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.5 In certain jurisdictions, the Taxes and Fees amount paid to the  Travel Supplier on your behalf in connection with your reservation may vary  from the Taxes and Fees amount Agoda estimates and includes in the charge to  you. The balance of the (estimated) charge for Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee  Agoda may retain as part of the compensation:</p>\n<p>&emsp;(a) in relation to any Flight component of your booking, as our  handling fee for the services provided by Agoda to you in respect of such  Flight(s); </p>\n<p>&emsp;(b) in relation to any Accommodation (as applicable depending on the  jurisdiction), as our fee for the services provided by Agoda to you in respect  of such Accommodation. </p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.6 You are fully responsible for all taxes, charges, fees, duties  and assessments arising out of the use of this Platform. While we aim to  provide customers with the total price of each booking on the Platform, there  is a chance that a government-imposed tax may be added or increased after the  booking is purchased. If this occurs, by accepting these Terms, you agree to  pay the new or higher government-imposed tax, where not prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.7 Except as otherwise described in these Terms, Agoda is not the  vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable tax authorities, unless  otherwise required by law or where Agoda is required to collect and remit taxes  on behalf of the Travel Suppliers. The relevant Travel Suppliers, as vendors,  include all known applicable taxes in the amount displayed as the total price  of your booking and Agoda pays over such amounts on your behalf directly to the  vendors or directly to the relevant tax authority where required by law. Agoda  is not a co-vendor associated with the vendors with whom we book or reserve our  customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the  type of applicable taxes may vary depending on various factors such as location,  type of service etc..</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.8 Where the Travel Product booking facilitation-related Services  are provided by any Partner or made via a Partner&rsquo;s platform, calculation of  applicable taxes and fees will be set out in such Partner&rsquo;s terms and  conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>8.3 Electronically Supplied Services </strong></p>\n<p>Agoda  may provide additional services independent of, in addition to, or ancillary to  the Services and the services offered by the Travel Suppliers (&ldquo;<strong>Electronically  Supplied Services</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>ESS</strong>&rdquo;). For these ESS, we may request a  service fee in consideration thereof, upon your acceptance of these ESS and  subject to specific terms and conditions you may agree to for obtaining such ESS.  For sake of clarity, such ESS fee if charged by Agoda will be over and above  the amount you may be charged by the Travel Suppliers for availing the services  offered by the Travel Suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>9. PAYMENT</strong></p>\n<p>9.1 Before you submit your Booking Request, you will be notified of  the payment methods that are acceptable for that Booking Request. While most  bookings are payable in full upon submission of your Booking Request (&ldquo;<strong>Pay  Now</strong>&rdquo;), we may in some cases offer you the option of paying Agoda at a later  date (&ldquo;<strong>Book Now, Pay Later</strong>&rdquo;) or paying the Travel Supplier directly (&ldquo;<strong>Pay  at Hotel</strong>&rdquo;).

SHOPPING CART</strong></p>\n<p>34.1 Agoda provides the option to search and request reservations for  combined and/or multiple bookings using the Shopping Cart for selected Travel  Products.

A combined or multiple booking may be completed  and paid for in a single visit to the Platform and if the booking is not  completed during the booking process, your selected Travel Products will be  temporarily saved for you to complete your purchase at a later time.

Please note that previously selected Travel Products may be sold  out or their prices may change.</p>\n<p>34.5 If you do not proceed with a combined or multiple booking of  Travel Products, the price of the individual Travel Product will be displayed.</p>\n<p>34.6 If you make a combined or multiple booking, you acknowledge and  agree that the terms and conditions of each Travel Product will apply to that  booking, as if it were a separate booking.

We reserve the  right to freely assign these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder.</p>\n<p>36.8 No failure or delay to exercise Agoda&rsquo;s rights under these Terms  shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall such failure or delay affect the  right to enforce Agoda&rsquo;s rights under these Terms.</p>\n<p>36.9 For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms do not apply to  commercial contractual relationships that the Agoda Group entities may have  with others, including but not limited to the Travel Suppliers and certain  marketing partners.</p>\n<p>36.10 Except  as provided for elsewhere in these Terms, including in the Arbitration Agreement  for U.S. Customers in clause 43 of these Terms, these Terms (and any and all  disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without  limitation any alleged breach, or challenge to the validity or enforceability,  of these Terms or any provision thereof) will be subject to the laws of the  Republic of Singapore.

The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available  online at www.adr.org. To the extent of any inconsistency, this clause will supersede and govern over the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>You and we agree that this clause evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision  will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal  Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law. Any  arbitration shall be initiated through and administered by the AAA and will be  held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at  another mutually agreed location. Should the AAA decline to administer the  arbitration or otherwise be unable to administer the arbitration for any  reason, you agree that the Agoda shall select an alternative arbitration forum,  and that you will agree in writing to administration of the arbitration by the  alternative arbitration forum selected by Agoda. The arbitration will be  conducted in the English language. You agree that, in the event of an in-person  hearing, any Agoda employee or affiliate who is based outside of the United  States and who is participating in the hearing may participate by telephone or  video conference, and his or her physical presence shall not be required.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration will be confidential, and  neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any  arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of  the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any  court having proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, pre-hearing information exchanges  will be limited to the reasonable production of non-privileged documents  directly relevant to the dispute. Unless the arbitrator determines that an  additional form of information exchange is necessary to provide for a  fundamentally fair process, those documents will be limited to your booking and  communications directly about that booking among you, Agoda, and the Travel  Product(s) or Service(s) that are the subject of your dispute with Agoda. Any  issues regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be  determined by the arbitrator, and the arbitrator&rsquo;s determination shall be  conclusive.</p>\n<p>We agree that we will pay all filing,  administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial filing fee that you  must pay to file the initial arbitration demand, and if your claim is for less  than USD $1,000 we will reimburse you for the filing fee if you provide a  written request for reimbursement. Otherwise, we will each bear the fees and  expense of our respective attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and  presentation of evidence at the arbitration.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitration Award</strong>: The  arbitrator will have the power to grant declaratory or injunctive relief,  whether interim or final, only in favor of you individually and only to the  extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual Claim without  affecting other customers or Agoda Account holders, and any provisional  measures ordered by the arbitrator may be enforced by any court of competent  jurisdiction. To the extent otherwise permitted by law, the arbitrator may also  allocate arbitrator compensation, administrative fees, and/or the prevailing  party&rsquo;s reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees to the losing party upon the arbitrator&rsquo;s  determination that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment  or is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p>Nothing in these Terms will prevent you from  seeking public injunctive relief separately from arbitration in court pursuant  to these Terms, and any such application will not be deemed incompatible with  the arbitration agreement to arbitrate or as a waiver of the right to arbitrate  your individual Claims. You and we agree that any proceedings seeking a remedy  of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all Claims  that can be arbitrated, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed  pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration  Act. If you file a lawsuit in court seeking public injunctive relief before  proceeding with an individual arbitration for damages, you will be waiving your  right to seek damages from Agoda.</p>\n<p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration  Agreement</strong>: You and we each agree that the following causes of action  and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Claims covered by the  arbitration agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court  of competent jurisdiction (as outlined in this arbitration agreement): (i) any  claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement,  misappropriation, or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade  secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or  cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent  circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking,  cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief,  where such remedies are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law.&nbsp;<strong>Class  Action Waiver</strong>: In addition to the above, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY  PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN  INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION,  EXCEPT FOR ACTIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND IN THIS  PARAGRAPH. Upon motion of one or more interested parties, and after providing  all other interested parties an opportunity to be heard, the arbitrator may, at  their discretion, coordinate more than one arbitration proceeding initiated  under this arbitration agreement, in order to promote efficiency in discovery  and to avoid inconsistent legal rulings. In the interest of clarity, any  coordination under the preceding sentence will be limited only to currently-pending  arbitrations initiated under this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator may  not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. All parties  will retain the right to request an individualized hearing.</p>\n<p>If a court or arbitrator determines, in an  action between you and us, that this class action waiver is unenforceable, this  arbitration agreement will not apply to you. If you opt out of the arbitration  agreement as specified above, this class action waiver will not apply to you. Neither  you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or  otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding  without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Waiver</strong>: IF  FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU  AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>44.

RANKING AND SPONSORED LISTINGS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>46.1 The default ranking for Accommodations is based on an automated  algorithm that may be subject to periodic updates or amendments. This ranking  considers multiple factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n      <ul>\n      <li>Availability</li>\n      <li>Promotions  and rates</li>\n      <li>Historical  popularity</li>\n      <li>Money  earned by Agoda</li>\n      <li>Conversion  (the ratio of bookings to Platform visits)</li>\n      <li>Sales  of room nights</li>\n      <li>Cancellations</li>\n      <li>Quality  of content</li>\n      <li>Guest  review scores</li>\n      <li>Star  ratings</li>\n      </ul>\n<p>46.2 Accommodation Travel Suppliers have various opportunities, such  as the Preferred Partner program or sponsored listings (i.e., pay for prime  positioning in search results), to improve their visibility on the Platform.  All such listings will be clearly marked and/or contain additional messaging to  note their participation.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><a name=\"mbaph\"></a><strong>47. PRIVATE HOSTS AND PROFESSIONAL TRADERS</strong></p>\n<p>47.1 Hosts which have registered with Agoda as a private host are  parties that rent out their property or properties for purposes outside their  trade, business, or profession. They are not officially traders (like a hotel  chain) and therefore may not fall under the same consumer protection rules  under EU (or other local) law.</p>\n<p>47.2 Properties managed by private hosts will display &ldquo;Managed by a  private host&rdquo;. Unless stated otherwise, in situations where properties are  managed by professional hosts (traders), no additional information will be  displayed.</p>\n<p>&ensp;47.2.1 <strong>Professional host (trader)</strong>: Any party  who rents out a property or properties for purposes relating to their primary  trade business or profession (e.g., when accommodations are the main business  activity, or the listing is managed by a property management company).</p>\n<p>&ensp;47.2.2 <strong>Private host (non-trader)</strong>: Any  party who rents out a property or properties for purposes outside their primary  trade business or profession (e.g., when accommodations are a side activity, or  when the property is only listed seasonally/occasionally).</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>48. ABOUT OUR REVIEWS</strong></p><a name=\"reviews\"></a>\n<p>48.1 Only certified guests who have booked through Agoda and not  cancelled their booking are invited by Agoda to submit a review.</p>\n<p>48.2 Whether negative or positive, we will post every comment in  full, and as quickly as possible, after being moderated to comply with  the&nbsp;<a href=\"/rewards/HotelReviewGuidelines.html\">Guest  Review Guidelines</a>. Some reviews may be temporarily truncated  for the sake of brevity, but anyone on our Platform can still access the entire  review. Reviews may also sometimes be summarized for the sake of brevity and  readability. We will also provide transparency over the status of submitted  content.</p>\n<p>48.3 Each review score is between 1-10. Guests are able to give a  separate &lsquo;sub-score&rsquo; in crucial areas, such as: location, cleanliness, staff,  comfort, facilities, value for money and free Wi-Fi. The calculated overall  score is simply an average of the sub-scores. When a review is partially  submitted, we ignore the data for all sub-scores not given.</p>\n<p>48.4 To keep the rating score and review content relevant, we may  only accept reviews that are submitted within 12 months of checking out and we  may stop showing reviews older than up to 36 months, or if the Accommodation  has a change of ownership.</p>\n<p>48.5 We may also show some review scores from other well-known travel  websites. We make it clear when we have done this – for instance, reviews from  Booking.com appear under a separate section of our website. We do not include  sponsored reviews within our reviews.</p>\n<p>48.6 By default, reviews with comments are sorted based on a mix of  criteria to display the most relevant reviews, including but not limited to,  your language, your travel profile, readability of the review, date of  submission, etc. Additional sorting options are available (by date, by rating,  etc.).</p>\n<p>48.7 If we find any fake reviews, we delete them and, if necessary,  act against whoever is responsible. For example, if a complaint is raised  against a particular review, we look at the review in question and may decide  it is inappropriate if it does not meet our review guidelines or appears not to  be a genuine review.</p>\n<p>48.8 The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Agoda  customers and properties and not of Agoda. Agoda does not accept responsibility  or liability for any reviews or responses. Agoda is a conduit (without any  obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.</p>\n<p>48.9 At Agoda, we believe real reviews from fellow travellers provide  some of the best information to help you and others make future bookings. To  assure that all reviews on the Platform are relevant, helpful, and genuine, we  employ strict guidelines. For further information, please see our&nbsp;<a href=\"/rewards/HotelReviewGuidelines.html\">Guest Review  Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>49. RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</strong></p><a name=\"right-of-withdrawal\"></a>\n<p>49.1 The 14 days withdrawal period provided for under EU consumer law  does not apply to bookings made through the Platform. Instead, the ability to  amend and/or cancel the booking will be governed by the cancellation and  amendment rights attached to the cancellation policy type.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>50. VISITOR NUMBERS</strong></p>\n<p>50.1 In accordance with Agoda.com’s obligations under the EU’s Digital Services Act (“DSA”), we estimate that the average monthly recipients* of the Agoda.com service in the European Union from 1 February 2023 up to and including 31 July 2023, is well below 45 million.</p>\n<p>This is only an estimate and is based on the data available to Agoda.com at this time, and the limited guidance in the DSA. This estimate is required to be published under the DSA and should not be used for any other purpose. The methodologies used to estimate average monthly recipients as defined in the DSA require significant judgement and design inputs, are subject to data and other limitations, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. This estimate may be revised upwards or downwards as Agoda.com refines its approach and in response to the publication of methodology by the European Commission. <br>\n  <br>\nPlease refer to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ir.bookingholdings.com/overview/default.aspx__;!!Hj9Y_P0nvg!XtDVS9St2vJz8wIvt6dgfeiE_Jh9bafl4Os-xQoMUMk6lMTtWlwZDQUvl9cxzQOmw-XgkKGmuRnlA0DN3B7SSmt75MbH$\" target=\"_blank\">Booking Holdings Inc. Investor Relations</a>&nbsp;website  for metrics we. consider relevant to Agoda.com’s business.</p>\n<p>*  ‘recipient of service’ is defined under the DSA to mean “any natural or legal  person who uses an intermediary service, in particular for the purposes of seeking  information and making it accessible”. This requires counting users to whom  information was displayed by the Agoda.com service, even if that user did not make  a transaction.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>51.

Purchasing Hopper CFAR through the Platforms grants to the purchaser, in exchange for the CFAR Fee, the right to cancel a flight through the Platforms and receive a full or partial refund as provided below. &nbsp;Neither documentation nor reason will be required in order to cancel. After the timeframe specified in Section 3 of these CFAR Terms has passed, Hopper CFAR will expire and any changes or cancellations to your booking will be subject to the fare rules imposed by the airline for your ticket.&nbsp;</span></li>\n    <li style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;margin-bottom:10.0pt;'><strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";color:windowtext;'>Hopper CFAR&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";color:black;'>Purchase Price</span></strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";color:black;'>.

Upon a valid cancellation of your booking within the timeframe specified in Section 3 of these CFAR Terms, Hopper will refund to you the percentage of the cost that you selected for your purchased flight, but excluding any additional services, as specified in the Hopper CFAR option that you purchased. Such refund will be in the form described in Section 5 of these CFAR Terms. A valid exercise of a Hopper CFAR option entitles you only to the refund described above in this clause. No additional expenses other than a percentage of the cost of the air travel purchased through the Platforms will be reimbursed (including, for example, the CFAR Fee or any other purchased items such as travel insurance). The amount of your refund is based on your original ticket and does not take into account for any changes you made to your booking.</span></li>\n    <li style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;margin-bottom:10.0pt;'><strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";'>Getting Refunded by Hopper</span></strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";'>.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";color:#1D1C1D;'>Hopper utilizes PayPal&rsquo;s Hyperwallet payment services to deliver payments to you.

Payments by Hopper of reimbursed amounts will be processed within ten (10) business days. Hyperwallet is a service provided by a third-party not affiliated with Hopper or Agoda. To use Hyperwallet to receive your refund, you will need to enter into a direct contract with Hyperwallet and agree to comply with the applicable terms and conditions linked to above. Payout options made available to you will be chosen in the sole discretion of Hyperwallet and, depending on the options made available for you, you may be required to create an account with Hyperwallet, if you do not already have one, in order to receive your refund. Before paying you your refund, Hyperwallet may be required to collect certain information from you in order to comply with anti-money laundering, sanctions and other requirements. Because you will enter into a contract directly with Hyperwallet, any liability or obligations Hyperwallet owes to you in relation to your use of Hyperwallet will be determined by your agreement with Hyperwallet, and not by Agoda or Hopper.</span><span style='font-size:13px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";'>&nbsp;</span></li>\n    <li style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;margin-bottom:10.0pt;'><strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";color:black;'>Exclusions</span></strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:     \"Proxima Nova\";color:black;'>.

Certain jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring airlines to compensate passengers in the event of certain cancellations, delays or other disruptions to scheduled air travel (a <strong>&ldquo;Passenger Rights Regime</strong>&rdquo;). You may have rights under these and other Passenger Rights Regimes even if you do not purchase Hopper CFAR. The value Hopper CFAR provides is as a quick and easy way for you to get a refund in the event you decide to cancel your flight, without having to go through your airline. For more detailed information regarding your existing cancellation policy from the respective airline, visit the airline&rsquo;s website, and for more details on the EU Passenger Rights Regime refer to European Union Regulation (EC) 261/2004.</span></li>\n    <li style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;margin-bottom:10.0pt;'><strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";'>Not Insurance</span></strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Proxima Nova\";'>. Subject to the restrictions and exclusions described above, Hopper CFAR allows airline tickets purchased on the Platforms to be canceled for any reason without incurring additional fees. Hopper provides its customers with Hopper CFAR to provide a more seamless and flexible experience.
