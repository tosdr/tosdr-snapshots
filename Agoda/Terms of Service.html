AGODA SERVICES</strong></p>\n<p>6.1 The terms in this Section B apply to Agoda&rsquo;s provision of its  Travel Product booking facilitation-related Services through the Platform.  Where the Travel Product booking facilitation-related Services are provided by  any Partner or made via a Partner&rsquo;s platform, please refer to that Partner&rsquo;s  respective terms and conditions of use and privacy policy instead as these will  govern the relation between you and that Partner. For the avoidance of doubt,  where the Travel Product is provided by a Partner, your booking through the  Platform is an offer to book a reservation (e.g., for Accommodations, Flights  or a rental car, you are making a request to book a reservation with the  Partner that is subject to acceptance by the Partner before it becomes a  binding transaction) at the price listed on the Platform for such Travel  Product on such other terms and conditions notified to you by the Partner at  the time of booking, which shall become a binding contract when your booking is  accepted by the Partner and will be subject to the Partner&rsquo;s terms and  conditions. Where applicable, the Partner will indicate the acceptance of such  Travel Product booking via an e-mail confirmation to you. In these cases, we  will provide your payment information to the relevant Partner to process your  payment and confirm your booking. The Partner reserves the right to reject  bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>6.2 Unless otherwise stated, all of our Travel Product booking  facilitation-related Services are provided by Agoda Company Pte.

Agoda does not  assume any liability for the quality, safety, frequency, or service levels of  such transportation services. Where your Confirmed Booking includes a  self-transfer, you are responsible for the transfer and, subject to the terms  of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/flights/info/agodaguarantee\">Agoda.com  Guarantee</a>&nbsp;(if available), Agoda does not assume any liability in  relation to the self-transfer.

The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by the  Travel Suppliers either directly or as an agent. The Travel Suppliers are  responsible for their respective Travel Products.

You  acknowledge that the &ldquo;thank you page&rdquo; shown after the submission of your  Booking Request does not indicate a Confirmed Booking and only indicates that  your Booking Request has been received by Agoda for processing.</p>\n<p>7.4 In some cases, we may provide you with a confirmation number in  the confirmation email (&ldquo;<strong>Booking Confirmation Number</strong>&rdquo;). Depending on the  policy of the Travel Supplier, the confirmation may also contain a voucher for  redemption (&ldquo;<strong>Booking Voucher</strong>&rdquo;). Neither we nor the Travel Supplier will  be responsible for Booking Confirmation Numbers or Booking Vouchers that are  lost, stolen or destroyed.</p>\n<p>7.5 The relevant Travel Supplier(s) may impose additional terms and  conditions, rules and restrictions (each a &ldquo;<strong>Travel Supplier Terms</strong>&rdquo;) that  will be applicable to your Confirmed Booking, including in relation to changes,  cancellations and refunds.

If you are booking on behalf of other persons, you are  required to ensure that they are aware of and agree to the applicable Travel  Supplier Terms. If you fail to comply with the Travel Supplier Terms, the  Travel Supplier has a right to refuse or cancel your booking without offering any  refunds. For enquiries about the Travel Supplier&rsquo;s products and services or its  Travel Supplier Terms, please contact the Travel Supplier directly.</p>\n<p>7.6 Except where prohibited by local law, Agoda has the right to  reject any Booking Request, and cancel any Confirmed Booking, including on  behalf of the Travel Supplier, or any part thereof, without reason. If you have  already made payment, we shall refund you the amounts paid in respect of such  rejected or cancelled parts in accordance with our&nbsp;<a href=\"/info/agoda-policies.html#5\">Refund Policy</a>,  unless:</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.1 you are in breach of these Terms or any applicable law;</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.2 the Travel Supplier Terms do not allow for refunds; or</p>\n<p>&ensp;7.6.3 Agoda deems in its sole discretion that you are not entitled to  a refund due to reasons including but not limited to suspected fraud or abuse.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>8.

If the conditions for applying\n                    both section (i) above and this section (ii) are otherwise met, only the price increase described in\n                    this section (ii) would be applied. &nbsp;</p>\n                <p>In respect of the above, an intermediary currency, typically USD, may be used in the calculation of currency amounts. As such, please note that the Charge Price may be calculated from the Product Price by first arriving at a USD amount from the Product Price (e.g. on the Booking Date) and then arriving at the Charge Price from that USD amount (e.g. on the Charge Date). Note that a difference in USD exchange rate can occur for which Agoda does not take responsibility.</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\" style=\"padding: 6px;\">(e) On Pay at Hotel Bookings</th>\n            <td style=\"padding: 6px;\">\n                <p>Where the Travel Product is an Accommodation and you make a Pay at Hotel booking (as defined further below), your total price will be updated to show the amount you will pay in the Product Currency.

The charge for  Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without  limitation, the amount Agoda pays the Travel Supplier and the location and type  of the Travel Supplier and/or Travel Product and may include a fee that Agoda  retains.</p>\n<p>&ensp;In relation to Flights or Accommodations,  these Taxes and Fees may include a fee for the facilitation services provided  by Agoda in relation to your Booking (&ldquo;<strong>Agoda Booking Fee</strong>&rdquo;).

While we aim to  provide customers with the total price of each booking on the Platform, there  is a chance that a government-imposed tax may be added or increased after the  booking is purchased. If this occurs, by accepting these Terms, you agree to  pay the new or higher government-imposed tax, where not prohibited by law.</p>\n<p>&ensp;8.2.7 Except as otherwise described in these Terms, Agoda is not the  vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable tax authorities, unless  otherwise required by law or where Agoda is required to collect and remit taxes  on behalf of the Travel Suppliers.

We may also charge  you for any costs and penalties incurred as a result of such violation. We recommend  that you read the refund, cancellation and no-show policies applicable to your  Flight(s) carefully prior to making your booking, including where the airline  changes or cancels your Flight booking.</p>\n<p>23.2 Sometimes, cheaper fares are available on the Platform for the  same Flight, for the same Flight segment(s) on the same date, at the same time  and on the same airline, however, these cheaper fares may carry special  restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund.

Upon Agoda’s collection of your full payment, your obligation to the Travel Supplier for that amount is extinguished, and in the event that Agoda does not remit any such amounts, the Travel Supplier will have recourse only against Agoda.</p>\n<p><i><strong>Contracting Entity for Bookings</strong></i></p>\n<p>43.1 If you are using our Platform in the United States for a booking  comprising Flights, our booking facilitation-related Services are provided by  Agoda International USA LLC, having its registered address at 251 Little Falls  Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808 New Castle County, on behalf of Agoda and all  references to “Agoda” in Sections B to G of these Terms as they apply to your  Confirmed Booking shall be references to Agoda International USA LLC, instead.<br>\n<p><i><strong>Fee</strong></i></p>\n<p>43.2 For accommodations, the room rate displayed through our Services  is a combination of the amount charged by the Travel Supplier and a fee charged  and retained by Agoda.&nbsp;Agoda may also charge and retain additional  separate fees in providing its Services to you, which may vary based on the  amount and type of booking. </p>\n<p>\n<p><i><strong>Arbitration</strong></i></p>\n<p>43.3 For US customers only: This clause 43.3 only applies to US  customers. Please read this clause 43.3 carefully. It affects rights that you  may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through binding  arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. This clause 43.3 will  survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>This provision is intended to be given the  broadest interpretation and application to encompass all disputes or claims  arising out of or relating to your relationship with Agoda, including the use  of our Platform, our Services and any other interactions with us (all, <strong>&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;</strong>). Agoda is committed to customer satisfaction. We will try to resolve  any concerns or problems with our services that you may have. If we are  unsuccessful, any dispute or Claim arising out of or relating to this clause and your relationship with Agoda or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate  company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,  misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding  arbitration, except that either of us may take Claims to small claims court if  they qualify for hearing by such a court.</p>\n<p><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>: Notwithstanding  the above, you may opt out of this binding arbitration provision within 30 days  after this clause comes into effect (the &quot;<strong>Opt Out Deadline</strong>&quot;).  This will be the earliest of: (a) the date you first used our Platform; (b) the  date you first used our Services; or (c) the date you started a relationship  with us. You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a  written notice using any of the following methods:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>By email to <a href=\"mailto:arbitration.optout@agoda.com\">arbitration.optout@agoda.com</a> with  the subject line: Terms of Use – US Opt Out Notice.</li>\n      <li>By regular mail or courier to our registered address at Legal Department, Agoda  Company Pte.

This  option is supported if you have made a booking through Agoda and have a confirmation number.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We must receive your opt-out notice no later  than 3 days after the Opt Out Deadline for it to be valid. You agree that you  must pursue any Claim in arbitration or small claims court (if available) if we  do not receive an opt-out notice from you, or if we receive an opt-out notice  from you more than 3 days after the Opt Out Deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-Dispute Resolution  Notice Obligation</strong>: For all Claims, you must first send a written description of  your Claim to us to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we  each agree to negotiate your Claim in good faith. You may request arbitration  if your Claim cannot be resolved within 60 days. You must send us written  notice of the Claim using either of the following methods:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>By  email to <a href=\"mailto:arbitration.optout@agoda.com\">arbitration.optout@agoda.com</a> with  the subject line: Terms of Use – US Dispute Notice.</li>\n      <li>By  regular mail or courier to our registered address at Legal Department, Agoda  Company Pte. Ltd., 30 Cecil Street, Prudential Tower #19-08, Singapore 049712.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The arbitration of any Claim will be conducted  in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;),  including the AAA's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_2.pdf\">Consumer  Arbitration Rules</a>&nbsp;(as applicable), as modified by this clause. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available  online at www.adr.org. To the extent of any inconsistency, this clause will supersede and govern over the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>You and we agree that this clause evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision  will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal  Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law. Any  arbitration shall be initiated through and administered by the AAA and will be  held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at  another mutually agreed location. Should the AAA decline to administer the  arbitration or otherwise be unable to administer the arbitration for any  reason, you agree that the Agoda shall select an alternative arbitration forum,  and that you will agree in writing to administration of the arbitration by the  alternative arbitration forum selected by Agoda. The arbitration will be  conducted in the English language. You agree that, in the event of an in-person  hearing, any Agoda employee or affiliate who is based outside of the United  States and who is participating in the hearing may participate by telephone or  video conference, and his or her physical presence shall not be required.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration will be confidential, and  neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any  arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of  the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any  court having proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, pre-hearing information exchanges  will be limited to the reasonable production of non-privileged documents  directly relevant to the dispute. Unless the arbitrator determines that an  additional form of information exchange is necessary to provide for a  fundamentally fair process, those documents will be limited to your booking and  communications directly about that booking among you, Agoda, and the Travel  Product(s) or Service(s) that are the subject of your dispute with Agoda. Any  issues regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be  determined by the arbitrator, and the arbitrator&rsquo;s determination shall be  conclusive.</p>\n<p>We agree that we will pay all filing,  administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial filing fee that you  must pay to file the initial arbitration demand, and if your claim is for less  than USD $1,000 we will reimburse you for the filing fee if you provide a  written request for reimbursement. Otherwise, we will each bear the fees and  expense of our respective attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and  presentation of evidence at the arbitration.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitration Award</strong>: The  arbitrator will have the power to grant declaratory or injunctive relief,  whether interim or final, only in favor of you individually and only to the  extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual Claim without  affecting other customers or Agoda Account holders, and any provisional  measures ordered by the arbitrator may be enforced by any court of competent  jurisdiction. To the extent otherwise permitted by law, the arbitrator may also  allocate arbitrator compensation, administrative fees, and/or the prevailing  party&rsquo;s reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees to the losing party upon the arbitrator&rsquo;s  determination that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment  or is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p>Nothing in these Terms will prevent you from  seeking public injunctive relief separately from arbitration in court pursuant  to these Terms, and any such application will not be deemed incompatible with  the arbitration agreement to arbitrate or as a waiver of the right to arbitrate  your individual Claims. You and we agree that any proceedings seeking a remedy  of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all Claims  that can be arbitrated, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed  pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration  Act. If you file a lawsuit in court seeking public injunctive relief before  proceeding with an individual arbitration for damages, you will be waiving your  right to seek damages from Agoda.</p>\n<p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration  Agreement</strong>: You and we each agree that the following causes of action  and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Claims covered by the  arbitration agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court  of competent jurisdiction (as outlined in this arbitration agreement): (i) any  claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement,  misappropriation, or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade  secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or  cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent  circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking,  cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief,  where such remedies are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law.&nbsp;<strong>Class  Action Waiver</strong>: In addition to the above, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY  PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN  INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION,  EXCEPT FOR ACTIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND IN THIS  PARAGRAPH. Upon motion of one or more interested parties, and after providing  all other interested parties an opportunity to be heard, the arbitrator may, at  their discretion, coordinate more than one arbitration proceeding initiated  under this arbitration agreement, in order to promote efficiency in discovery  and to avoid inconsistent legal rulings. In the interest of clarity, any  coordination under the preceding sentence will be limited only to currently-pending  arbitrations initiated under this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator may  not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. All parties  will retain the right to request an individualized hearing.</p>\n<p>If a court or arbitrator determines, in an  action between you and us, that this class action waiver is unenforceable, this  arbitration agreement will not apply to you. If you opt out of the arbitration  agreement as specified above, this class action waiver will not apply to you. Neither  you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or  otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding  without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Waiver</strong>: IF  FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU  AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>44.

PRIVATE HOSTS AND PROFESSIONAL TRADERS</strong></p>\n<p>47.1 Hosts which have registered with Agoda as a private host are  parties that rent out their property or properties for purposes outside their  trade, business, or profession. They are not officially traders (like a hotel  chain) and therefore may not fall under the same consumer protection rules  under EU (or other local) law.</p>\n<p>47.2 Properties managed by private hosts will display &ldquo;Managed by a  private host&rdquo;. Unless stated otherwise, in situations where properties are  managed by professional hosts (traders), no additional information will be  displayed.</p>\n<p>&ensp;47.2.1 <strong>Professional host (trader)</strong>: Any party  who rents out a property or properties for purposes relating to their primary  trade business or profession (e.g., when accommodations are the main business  activity, or the listing is managed by a property management company).</p>\n<p>&ensp;47.2.2 <strong>Private host (non-trader)</strong>: Any  party who rents out a property or properties for purposes outside their primary  trade business or profession (e.g., when accommodations are a side activity, or  when the property is only listed seasonally/occasionally).</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><a name=\"reviews\"><strong>48. ABOUT OUR REVIEWS</strong></a></p>\n<p>48.1 Only certified guests who have booked through Agoda and not  cancelled their booking are invited by Agoda to submit a review.</p>\n<p>48.2 Whether negative or positive, we will post every comment in  full, and as quickly as possible, after being moderated to comply with  the&nbsp;<a href=\"/rewards/HotelReviewGuidelines.html\">Guest  Review Guidelines</a>. Some reviews may be temporarily truncated  for the sake of brevity, but anyone on our Platform can still access the entire  review. Reviews may also sometimes be summarized for the sake of brevity and  readability. We will also provide transparency over the status of submitted  content.</p>\n<p>48.3 Each review score is between 1-10. Guests are able to give a  separate &lsquo;sub-score&rsquo; in crucial areas, such as: location, cleanliness, staff,  comfort, facilities, value for money and free Wi-Fi. The calculated overall  score is simply an average of the sub-scores. When a review is partially  submitted, we ignore the data for all sub-scores not given.</p>\n<p>48.4 To keep the rating score and review content relevant, we may  only accept reviews that are submitted within 12 months of checking out and we  may stop showing reviews older than up to 36 months, or if the Accommodation  has a change of ownership.</p>\n<p>48.5 We may also show some review scores from other well-known travel  websites. We make it clear when we have done this – for instance, reviews from  Booking.com appear under a separate section of our website. We do not include  sponsored reviews within our reviews.</p>\n<p>48.6 By default, reviews with comments are sorted based on a mix of  criteria to display the most relevant reviews, including but not limited to,  your language, your travel profile, readability of the review, date of  submission, etc. Additional sorting options are available (by date, by rating,  etc.).</p>\n<p>48.7 If we find any fake reviews, we delete them and, if necessary,  act against whoever is responsible. For example, if a complaint is raised  against a particular review, we look at the review in question and may decide  it is inappropriate if it does not meet our review guidelines or appears not to  be a genuine review.</p>\n<p>48.8 The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Agoda  customers and properties and not of Agoda. Agoda does not accept responsibility  or liability for any reviews or responses. Agoda is a conduit (without any  obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.</p>\n<p>48.9 At Agoda, we believe real reviews from fellow travellers provide  some of the best information to help you and others make future bookings. To  assure that all reviews on the Platform are relevant, helpful, and genuine, we  employ strict guidelines.

RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</strong></a></p>\n<p>49.1 The 14 days withdrawal period provided for under EU consumer law  does not apply to bookings made through the Platform.

VISITOR NUMBERS</strong></p>\n<p>50.1 In accordance with Agoda.com’s obligations under the EU’s Digital Services Act (“DSA”), we estimate that the average monthly recipients* of the Agoda.com service in the European Union from 1 February 2023 up to and including 31 July 2023, is well below 45 million.</p>\n<p>This is only an estimate and is based on the data available to Agoda.com at this time, and the limited guidance in the DSA. This estimate is required to be published under the DSA and should not be used for any other purpose. The methodologies used to estimate average monthly recipients as defined in the DSA require significant judgement and design inputs, are subject to data and other limitations, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. This estimate may be revised upwards or downwards as Agoda.com refines its approach and in response to the publication of methodology by the European Commission. <br>\n  <br>\nPlease refer to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ir.bookingholdings.com/overview/default.aspx__;!!Hj9Y_P0nvg!XtDVS9St2vJz8wIvt6dgfeiE_Jh9bafl4Os-xQoMUMk6lMTtWlwZDQUvl9cxzQOmw-XgkKGmuRnlA0DN3B7SSmt75MbH$\" target=\"_blank\">Booking Holdings Inc.

This requires counting users to whom  information was displayed by the Agoda.com service, even if that user did not make  a transaction.</p>\n<p class=\"fontsmallb\"><strong>51.
