The videos, articles and other content that you choose to save may be protected by copyright and other laws. Please refer to the website you were visiting when you saved such content for copyright notices, information and restrictions that may be applicable to such content.</p>
<p>We respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. The Pocket Technologies allow you to time-shift across devices and platforms so that you can access information later that you had the right to access when you saved such content to Pocket. As a condition to your use of the Pocket Technologies, you agree not to use the Pocket Technologies to infringe any intellectual property rights. We reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice, to terminate the accounts of, and block access to the Pocket Technologies to, any users who infringe any copyrights or other intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>We offer a paid subscription service (&quot;Pocket Premium&quot;) which, among other things, provides paid subscribers with certain features that are not made available to users of the standard, free version of the Pocket Technologies. Each paid subscriber has a separate, personal library in which an archival copy of saved content is stored for that subscriber’s own personal non-commercial use at a later time. The Pocket Premium subscription service also includes other features, such as full-text searching of saved content and suggested tags for an item. Subscriptions to Pocket Premium are available on monthly and yearly subscription plans.</p>

You are solely responsible for all information which you share, save, submit, publish, display, disseminate or otherwise communicate through the Pocket Technologies, even if a claim should arise after termination of service. You agree that all such content, messages and other communications shall not be deemed to be private or secure, and that any such content, messages and communications can be read by the operators and/or other agents of Mozilla, whether or not they are the intended recipients.

We also reserve the right to terminate the account of any user who transfers or saves content in violation of this Agreement. We shall have no liability or responsibility to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</strong></p>
<h2 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Mozilla, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, distributors and licensees, from and against any judgments, losses, deficiencies, damages, liabilities, costs, claims, demands, suits, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and expenses) incurred in, arising out of or in any way related to your breach of this Agreement, your use of the Pocket Technologies, or any of your other acts or omissions.</p>
<h2 id="disputes">Disputes</h2>
<p><strong>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE POCKET TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DISPUTES RELATED TO THE POCKET PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. AN ARBITRATOR, HOWEVER, MAY AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AS A COURT WOULD. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT, AND ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT. THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE ALL ISSUES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ISSUES RELATING TO THE SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.</strong></p>
<p>To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: President, Mozilla Corporation/Pocket Business Unit, 149 New Montgomery Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration will take place in the county (or parish) where you live. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with that organization’s &quot;Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures&quot; if JAMS has an office in the county (or parish) where the arbitration takes place. Otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. JAMS rules and other information are available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">https://www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267. The AAA’s rules and other information are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. We will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fees, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. The arbitrator shall have the discretion to award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including the cost of the arbitration and of experts) to the prevailing party, but we will only seek such fees if the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
<p><strong>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</strong></p>

<h2 id="children">Access by Children</h2>
<p>In the United States, if you are a device manufacturer or other third party (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) that provides devices to children under the age of 13 that utilize the Pocket Technologies, you assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&quot;FERPA&quot;). This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Pocket application the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Pocket Technologies. Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions</a>.</p>
