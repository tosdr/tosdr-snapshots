Customer understands that it would have had an opportunity to litigate any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement through a court, to have a judge or jury decide its case, and to participate in a class or representative action, but has instead chosen to have any controversy, dispute or claim resolved through individual arbitration. Any dispute regarding the enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision will be heard in the state or federal courts of Indianapolis, Indiana, and each party consents to the jurisdiction thereof.</p>

Except for obligations of Customer for the payment of Fees or other sums hereunder, if either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by force majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, that party shall give to the other party prompt notice of the force majeure with reasonable specificity. Thereupon the obligations of the Party giving notice, so far as they are affected by the force majeure, shall be suspended during, but no longer than, the continuance of the force majeure. The affected Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove the force majeure as quickly as possible. The term “force majeure” shall without limitation mean an act of God, strike, industrial disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, blockage, public riot, lightning, fire, storm, flood, epidemic/pandemic, failure of utilities,<br>failure of internet collocation facilities or other Internet failure, any unauthorized server or<br>computer violation or other security violation, explosion, governmental restraint, or any other<br>cause, whether of the kind specifically enumerated above or otherwise, which is not reasonably<br>within the control of the Party claiming suspension.</p>
<p><br>j. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all Order Forms, constitutes the<br>entire agreement between the Parties, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom the modification, amendment, or waiver is to be asserted. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise in the applicable Order Form. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be language chosen by both Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction against either Party shall apply to rights granted herein or to any term of condition of this Agreement.</p>
<p><br>k. Precedence. To the extent that the Parties have entered into any other written agreements for the provision of services that are beyond the scope of the Services provided pursuant to this Agreement, and to the extent that such agreements conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control as to the contents hereof and the subject<br>matter contained herein with respect to the provision of the Services, unless expressly provided to the contrary in such other agreements.<br><br>l. Acceptance. Customer accepts and agrees to be bound and abide by the terms of this Agreement in any of the following manners: Customer (i) clicking a box indicating Customer’s acceptance of this Agreement; (ii) performing some other form of assent hereto; or (iii) executing or otherwise agreeing to an Order Form that references this Agreement and of<br>which this Agreement is a part. Such acceptance shall apply to Permitted Users.</p>
<p><br>m. Changes to Agreement. Provider reserves the right to modify the terms and<br>conditions of this Agreement, and such modifications shall be binding on Customer immediately upon posting of the updated Agreement to the Services. Customer should check for updates frequently. Provider reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlink(s) from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Services after any such changes shall constitute Customer’s consent to such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, Customer agrees that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).</p>
