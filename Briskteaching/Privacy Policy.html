When the Service is used as part of a School’s educational curriculum, the personal data related to Students that is (i) provided to Brisk by a School, or (ii) collected by Brisk during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as “educational records” by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or “covered information” under California’s Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (“SOPIPA”), or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws. We call this information “Student Data.”</p><p class="paragraph-109">As between us and the School, Student Data is owned and controlled by the School. Our collection and use of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the Schools and by applicable privacy laws.
