STUDENT RECORDS<br/></div></div><div class="info-block"><p>We consider Student Records to be confidential and do not use Student Records for any purpose other than to provide the Service on the School’s behalf, in accordance with contractual agreements with the School. To help Schools address their obligations to protect their students’ data privacy, we have implemented additional controls and procedures for Schools when they enter into a contract with Brisk to use the Service as part of a School’s educational curriculum. When the Service is used as part of a School’s educational curriculum, the personal data related to Students that is (i) provided to Brisk by a School, or (ii) collected by Brisk during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as “educational records” by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or “covered information” under California’s Student Online Personal Data Protection Act (“SOPIPA”), or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws. We call this information “Student Records.”<br/></p><p>As between us and the School, Student Records are owned and controlled by the School. Our collection and use of Student Records is governed by our contracts with the Schools and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we provide the Service to Schools as a “School Official” under FERPA and we work with Schools to help protect personal data from the Student’s educational record, as required by the FERPA.<br/></p><ul role="list"><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We collect, maintain, use and share Student Records only for an authorized educational purpose and as described in our Agreement with the School, or as directed by the School or by the Student’s parent or legal guardian (each, a “Parent”).</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We do not use or disclose Student Records for targeted advertising purposes.</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We do not build a personal profile of a Student other than in furtherance of an educational purpose.</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Records maintained by the Service.</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We will never sell Student Records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Notice or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting the Student Records before the transfer occurs.</div></li><li class="regular-bullet-list"><div class="text-size-regular policy">We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Notice or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.</div></li></ul></div><div class="text-para-block"><div class="margin-bottom margin-xsmall"><div class="text-regular-underline">How We Share And Disclose Student Records<br/></div></div><p>We disclose Student Records solely as needed to provide the Service on behalf of specific Schools in accordance with our contractual agreements with those Schools or with the consent of the School or Parent. For example, Student Records and account usage data may be disclosed to or accessible by users who are authorized to use the Service on behalf of the School. In addition, depending on the manner in which Brisk is used by the School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Brisk, we may provide access to certain Student Records to the Student and/or to the Parent of the Student about whom the records relate, for the purpose of monitoring Student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School’s use of the Service.
