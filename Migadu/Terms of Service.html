    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Migadu.com is an email management service. We have first built it to simplify our
own email tasks. We now offer it in good faith, hoping it will be of even better
service to you.</p>
<p>To use Migadu services you must agree to our house rules, called terms and
conditions in the lawyer lingo. We try to keep these rules reasonable, human-readable
and understandable.</p>
<p>Your complete satisfaction is our number one priority. Please tell us if anything
falls short of your expectations so we can actually do something about it,
regardless of these rules. Nothing is set in stone, and we are open to making
adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="general-rules">General Rules</h2>
<p>Our service is provided exclusively to individuals who are at least 18 years of
age, or to minors who have obtained parental consent to open and maintain an
account.</p>
<p>For registration, we require a valid, permanent email address. Use of temporary
email addresses will result in account termination. We must be able to
communicate with account holders.</p>
<p>Each account holder is solely responsible for all messages sent or received
through our service. As a condition for using, you agree to not use Migadu
services for any unlawful or prohibited activities. This includes any unethical or
undesired activities by any party.</p>
<p>You also agree to be bound by these terms. We may at our sole discretion, terminate
service without cause or notice. In a case of a severe violation of these terms we
may refuse communication with violators as well ignore their appeals.</p>
<p>Please understand that we take a hard stand, but in practice we will try
to keep you informed of everything that concerns your account. We will take
aggressive actions only when absolutely necessary to protect ourselves,
our property, other users as well third parties.</p>
<p>By using our services, you agree to abide by all national and international laws
and regulations and to not use the same for any illegal purposes. The include but
are not limited to spamming, misrepresentation (spoofing) and phishing, as well
usage of our services for purposes that violate third party terms of services.</p>
<p>You also agree not to disrupt the Migadu networks and servers. You further agree
to not use Migadu to send spam (junk) mail, or mailing list emails that contain
persons that have not specifically agreed to be included on that list. Migadu is
a quite cost inefficient choice for that anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Any account found to be generating spam will be immediately blocked and a penalty
of up to $500 may apply if the violation is found to be intentional.</strong></p>
<p>In response to abuse reports, complaints or court orders we may also terminate
accounts which are found to be used for illegal or fraudulent activity. We have
no obligation to store or forward the contents of terminated accounts.</p>
<p>By using our services, you are our guest. Guest manners apply.</p>
<h2 id="white-hat-usage">White-hat Usage</h2>
<p>Several security companies have found Migadu very convenient for penetration testing.
However, unless such activities are announced to us well ahead of time, the account may
be terminated and targeted parties informed. Please do not count on not being caught by us,
as it will ruin your investment.</p>
<p>Please introduce yourself first, your company as well your intentions before attempting phishing
techniques. If found legit, we will approve your account and require you to use the Maxi plan to
compensate for any additional administration overhead your activities may cause us.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our privacy policy is <a href="/privacy/">available as a separate document</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="the-free-trial">The Free Trial</h2>
<p>We offer a limited, free trial of our services with a time limitation.
The purpose of the free trial is to allow a test drive our platform before
committing to a paid plan. The free trial comes without any guarantees and is
limited to a subset of features and actual quotas of the paid plans.</p>
<p><strong>We may limit or terminate an ongoing trial account at our sole discretion
without any previous announcement. We may also modify the conditions or
withdraw the free trial offering completely at some point without an announcement.</strong></p>
<h2 id="quotas">Quotas</h2>
<p>Migadu accounts are limited by quotas of incoming and outgoing messages as well
storage amounts. After reaching the quota limit, you will be warned and kindly
asked to upgrade to a higher plan or continue by paying for overages. We may at
our sole discretion change or remove the daily quotas.</p>
<p>If an account is continuously over quota for seven days, the account will be
blocked and if applicable, downgraded forcefully. Appeal will be possible for up
to 30 days to resolve the block. Uncleared, blocked accounts will be purged after
30 days regardless of the previous plan.</p>
<p>Free accounts as well accounts which are significantly over quota limits may be
blocked even before the seven days limit.</p>
<p>Domains of blocked accounts are automatically added to our permanent blacklists.</p>
<h2 id="account-termination">Account Termination</h2>
<p>If you do not wish to use our services anymore, you have to terminate your account
yourself by authenticating first against it. Authentication proves ownership. We
cannot accept termination requests via email or third party services.</p>
<p>If you are on a paid plan, please downgrade your plan first. Removing all domains
but leaving the account on a paid plan will still incur monthly or yearly charges
which will be non refundable.</p>
<p>If you intend to request a refund, please do so before terminating your account.
After you have terminated your account, we will not accept any refund request.</p>
<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
<p>We care deeply about providing you with the best service possible.</p>
<p>Most of our users start on our free plan to test drive the service before
continuing to a paid plan.</p>
<p>If you sign up for one of our paid plans and find our services unsatisfactory or
simply unfit for your needs within the first 14 days, we do offer a worry-free
money back guarantee. If you have used our service extensively during those 14 days,
we may deduct the prorated cost of usage and refund the remainder.</p>
<p><strong>After 14 days of payment, all sales are to be considered final. That includes
payments for new monthly and yearly plans, prepayments as well renewals.</strong></p>
<p>Downgrading an account or changing plans may result in positive account balance.
Those account balances are automatically consumed in later charges. If no further
transactions happen within a year, unchanged positive account balances expire.</p>
<p>If you are requesting a refund, please do so from an account using the support
ticketing system.</p>
<p><strong>Refund requests for already terminated accounts will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
<p>Migadu is a service which is actively developed and maintained. It will
certainly include errors. We may make improvements and changes at any time
without notice. We do not make any guarantees about the reliability of the
service and do not guarantee the security of user data despite best efforts.</p>
<p>The service is provided “as is” and you agree not to hold us responsible
for any damages that arise as a result of the loss of use, data, or profits
connected to the performance of this service. Furthermore, you will not hold
us liable if confidential material is unintentionally released as the result of
a security failure or vulnerability. For sensitive materials, please use a strong
encryption scheme such as GPG.</p>
<p>That said, we do strive to make Migadu as reliable and secure as possible by
all means.</p>
<h2 id="refusal-of-service">Refusal of Service</h2>
<p>We retain the right to refuse service without further explanations. Common reasons
are violations of these rules, verbal or attacks of any kind on Migadu, its employees,
infrastructure or image.</p>
<p>We hope to never have to exercise that right. We are here to serve you after all,
not deny service. However, avoid being someone we do not want to be associated with.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree that we cannot be held responsible for any third party claim, demand,
or damage, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of our
services. You, and solely you, take responsibility for your actions while
using our service.</p>
<h2 id="terms-modifications">Terms Modifications</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to review and change this agreement at any time.
You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms and Conditions.
Continued use of our services after such changes shall constitute your
consent to such changes.</p>
<h2 id="validity">Validity</h2>
<p>Should individual provisions of these terms be wholly or partially void and/or ineffective, the
validity and/or effectiveness of the remaining provisions or parts of such provisions shall remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The invalid and/or ineffective provisions shall be replaced by such provisions which correspond to the meaning and purpose of the
invalid and/or unenforceable provisions in a legally effective manner economically closest
is coming. The same applies to possible gaps in the regulation.</p>
<h2 id="applicable-law">Applicable Law</h2>
<p>This agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Canton of
Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Swiss Confederation. All actions commenced pursuant hereto shall
be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction residing in the Canton of
Appenzell Ausserrhoden.</p>
