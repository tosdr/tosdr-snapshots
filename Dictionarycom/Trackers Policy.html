<h2><strong>COOKIE POLICY</strong></h2>
<p>This Cookie Policy explains how cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs, and other similar files or technologies may be used to collect and store the information automatically collected about your computer, device, and Service usage and how you can control the use of these technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies and other Trackers.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</strong> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors. Some ad companies and game developers use “flash cookies” for ads and games that use Flash media technology. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. We use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the Services and generally improve your experience. Ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites that are more relevant to you and your interests. There are two broad categories of cookies:
<ul>
<li>First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.</li>
<li>Third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES? We use cookies to:
<ul>
<li>track traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with our Services;</li>
<li>understand the total number of visitors to our sites on an ongoing basis and the types of internet browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari or Edge), operating systems (e.g. Windows or Mac OS), and screen resolutions used by our visitors;</li>

We’ve set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties set in the following table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

These cookies enable such companies to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the web.<br />
Cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you’ve seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you’ve last seen it. This information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 10px;">Social Media Cookies</td>
<td style="padding: 10px;">Third parties that make their applications available through/on our Sites may set their own cookies in order to track the performance of their applications or customize those applications for you. For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us. Some pages of our Sites may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.</td>

<ul>
<li><u>COOKIE CONTROLS.</u> You can control your cookie settings as explained below. We may disclose your opt-out choices to third parties so that they can honor your preferences in accordance with applicable laws.
<ul>
<li>Web Browser Controls. Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones We uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the “Help” option in your browser for more details.</li>
<li><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy">Cookie settings in Microsoft Edge</a></li>

</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">We note that an optional browser setting or extensions known as Do Not Track (DNT) or Universal Opt-Out which allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. A DNT or universal opt-out request is a signal that is sent by a third-party platform on behalf of a website user that communicates the user’s choice to opt-out of the sale and sharing of their personal information. Essentially, these signals are a way for users to communicate privacy preferences to a host of websites by using a specific search engine or browser plug-in rather than having to manually indicate the user’s preferences on each website the user visits. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of our Online Services and features. For example, we may not recognize your device.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Flash Cookie Controls. You can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website.</li>
<li>Web-Beacons. You can usually prevent the operation of web-beacons by changing your web-browser cookie settings and your ad choices, or for those in emails, by switching off images in your email client or viewing emails using only the “text” display (rather than “HTML” display”). See the “Help” section of your email client for instructions. Please see the All About Cookies website for further information about managing your options.</li>
<li>Mobile Apps. With respect to our mobile apps, you can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.</li>
<li>Google Analytics Controls. To see an overview of privacy at Google and how to opt out of certain Google practices, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy</a>. You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. Opting-out is generally done by the third party dropping a cookie on your browser indicating your intent to opt-out. If you get a new device, install a new browser, erase, or otherwise alter the third party’s browser cookie file, you may clear the opt-out cookie and no longer be subject to its opt-out.</li>
<li>Third Party Advertising Controls.
