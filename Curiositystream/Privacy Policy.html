("we," "our," "us" or "CS") or a third party agent of CS, and other websites, apps, and services where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the "Sites"). The Sites include, without limitation, the services offered on or in connection with the Curiosity Stream (<a target="_blank" href="https://curiositystream.com/"> <span style="color:rgb(5, 99, 193);">https://curiositystream.com/</span></a>), Curiosity University (or CuriosityU) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.curiosityu.com/"><span style="color:rgb(5, 99, 193);">https://www.curiosityu.com/</span></a>) and Learn25 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.learn25.com/"> <span style="color:rgb(5, 99, 193);">https://www.learn25.com/</span></a>) websites and any related mobile applications or platforms.</p><p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BECAUSE BY USING THE SITES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AS FAR AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE INFORMATION PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES.</p><p>Your use of the Sites is also expressly subject to our Terms of Use, available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://curiositystream.com/terms/"> <span style="color:rgb(5, 99, 193);">https://curiositystream.com/terms/</span></a>.</p><p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to keep up to date on how we are handling your personal information.</p><p> <strong>A. Notice at Collection</strong></p><p>CS may collect or process various categories of personal information, such as when you interact with content on our Sites. Section B, "Personal Information Collected," contains information on the categories of data collected about you. As an overview, we collect: identifiers; financial information; commercial information; internet or other electronic network activity information; audio, electronic, visual, or similar information; and sensitive personal information. We collect this information to provide, maintain, and improve our Sites, and for other reasons listed in Section C, "Use of Information Collected Via the Sites." We will retain your information for as long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<em></em>We may disclose, sell, or share your personal information and sensitive personal information as outlined in Section E, "Disclosure, Sale, and Sharing of Personal Information." We may sell or share identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, and any of the categories of personal information listed in Section B, below. To exercise your right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising, or to limit our use of your sensitive personal information, please visit Section I, "Your Rights and Choices," below.&nbsp;</p><p> <strong>B. Personal Information Collected</strong></p><p>We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) personal information; and (2) non-personal information. "Personal information" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, your household, or device, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. "Non-personal information" is information that does NOT identify you or your household personally. We note, however, that throughout time, non-personal information could become personal information through regulatory developments, technological advancements, or co-mingling with personal information. Where personal information and non-personal information are combined, we treat the combined set of information as personal information.</p><p>(1) Active Collection</p><p>We collect and store personal information from you directly, at the time you supply information to us via the Sites, in each case always insofar as permitted and only in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For instance, if you sign up for an account or contact us with a question, we may store your communications, including any personal information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you. The information we actively collect from you may include:</p><ul> <li>Email address, first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you subscribe to the Sites.</li> <li>Email address if you contact us with a question or seek more information about us through the Sites.</li> <li>Name and email address if you enter or otherwise communicate in a chat room, blog or other public area on the Sites or on one of CS's social networking pages.</li> <li>Email address and name if you sign up to receive a newsletter from one of the Sites or if you otherwise request information from the Sites.</li> <li>Demographic Information, which may include your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites. We use this information insofar as permitted by the applicable law, including obtaining your consent where required under law, to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Sites meets your needs.</li> <li>Social media information, political affiliations, and interests, to get a better idea of how to serve you (if you have consented to the processing of this personal information where such a consent is required under applicable to law).</li> <li>Location information if you choose to allow us to track your location through the Sites or if your personal information indicates a certain geographic location. This information may help us provide recommendations to you based on your location, serve you with advertisements, or direct you to products or services that we believe may be of interest to you and that is marketed to people near your location as far as the use of personal information is permitted for this purpose under applicable data protection law.</li></ul><p>(2) Passive Collection&nbsp;</p><p>We, or third parties working on our behalf, may collect information passively while you are visiting or interacting with the Sites. We call this "passive" collection because, if permitted by applicable data protection laws, you may not know that this information is being collected. The information we passively collect from you may include:</p><ul> <li>Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data - such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites.</li> <li>Any of the personal information outlined in the chart below through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. For more information on cookies and similar technologies, please see Section N below.</li></ul><p>(3) Collection via Other Sources</p><p>We may collect your personal information from other sources, such as contractors, service providers, business partners, or affiliates. For example, we collect information about payments you make via our payment processors working on our behalf. We may also collect your personal information, such as your name and email address, when someone purchases a gift card for you.&nbsp;</p><p>For your reference, we have provided a chart of the categories of personal information we may have collected about you in the past 12 months, along with the respective source(s), purpose(s), and any disclosure to third parties per each category (in each case as far as such a collection and disclosure of personal Information is permitted for the purpose(s) set out below under applicable data protection law, including obtaining your consent where required under law).</p><div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Category of Personal Information</td> <td>Source(s)</td> <td>Purpose(s)</td> <td>Disclosure to Third Parties</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <strong>Identifiers</strong>: name;

If you choose to subscribe to the Sites, we may collect information from you such as your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to process your payment. We may also provide such information, or other personal information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your subscription (for example, to process your credit card).</li> <li>To vendors, affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties for advertising and marketing purposes, including generating web analytics and compiling user information for marketing purposes, advertising, conducting marketing analysis, providing you with recommendations for products or services based on your profile, and promotional material planning and distribution pursuant to your consent or otherwise in accordance with applicable law.

We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personal information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personal information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personal information to us.</li> <li>To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors to fulfill a request made by you. For example, if you email us a question or otherwise inquire about one of our services, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personal information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers.

In the course of such verification, we may receive personal information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to subscribe to the Sites or otherwise make a purchase through the Sites, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties.</li> <li>In the unlikely event of a direct or indirect reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, bankruptcies, and sales of all or a part of our assets, CS may disclose your personal information and non-personal information following completion of such transaction and/or during the assessment process pending transfer. If transferred in such a case, the purchaser will abide by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><ul> <li>Job applicant information will be disclosed to individuals within our company that have a legitimate business need to access the information. We may also disclose your personal information to service providers, such as employment consultants or background search providers.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul> <li>When you engage in a business relationship with us, we will collect and process your personal information as described in the "Personal Information Collected" section of this Policy. We use this information for business purposes such as to run our Sites and provide our services.

If you are engaging with us on behalf of others in your company or otherwise providing the personal information of others, by engaging with us, you acknowledge and agree that you have obtained any required consent from those individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>(2) Non-Personal Information</p><p>We may share non-personal information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above and in other ways as permitted by law. For example, we may track and analyze non-personal information and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p><p id="information-sharing">(3) Sale or Sharing for Targeted Advertising Purposes</p><p>To personalize our ads and marketing experiences, and to provide tailored video content, we work with advertising and analytics partners, ad networks, and social media sites. These partnerships may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" under some U.S. laws, even when no money exchanges hands. For example, when you log in to your account on a web page where cookies are present, that may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information.</p><p>The personal information we might "sell" or "share" includes your basic name and contact information, online activity information, customer records, and other personal information or sensitive personal information outlined in Section B, above. If you want to opt-out of this use, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/cfuXhbjHJop9iRC86" target="_blank">form</a>. CS does not knowingly sell or share the personal information of children under the age of 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> <strong>F. Collection and Use of Information from Children</strong></p><p>The Sites are not intended for use by persons under the age of 16, or under the age of 18 for visitors located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). CS does not knowingly collect information from visitors under the age of 16, or 18 in the EEA. In the event that we learn that a person under these ages has provided CS with personal information, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems.</p><p> <strong>G. Video Content on the Sites</strong></p><p>The primary purpose of the Sites is to make available to consumers educational, informational, and entertainment video content, audiovisual content, and content of a like nature (collectively, the "Video Content"). In connection with our provision of Video Content, the Sites may utilize online targeting technologies and code-based tools, including, but not limited to, social media pixels, Software Development Kits ("SDKs"), and cookies (i.e., advertising or analytics cookies) that track information about your activity and webpage-viewing history on the Sites (collectively, "Targeting Tools") in order to recommend, both on the Sites and on third-party vendor sites, tailored Video Content and to gauge performance of Video Content, the Sites and CS in general. Targeting Tools on the Sites may result in information about your activity on the Sites being transmitted from your browser to CS and third parties, which, in turn, may result in the display of targeted advertisements on third-party websites and platforms, including advertisements for CS content. In addition, whether Targeting Tools on the Sites result in your browser’s transmission of information to third parties depends on a number of factors that may be outside of CS’s knowledge or control, including what third-party websites you use, what information you have provided to such third parties, and whether (and the extent to which) you have limited the use of cookies by the operators of those third-party websites. For more information about these targeting tools and how to control the personal information collected by these tools, please see Section N, below.&nbsp;</p><p> <strong>H. International Transfer of Information</strong></p><p>If you choose to provide CS with personal information, and with your prior consent or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, CS may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU/EEA and may provide more limited recourse mechanisms, including dissimilar or, at times, weaker data protection rights. In case of such transfer, appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU standard contractual clauses) will be used to ensure an adequate level of protection of your personal information.</p><p>With knowledge of these risks, you understand that:</p><ul> <li>Your personal information may be used for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the applicable data protection law; and</li> <li>Your personal information may be transferred to the United States as indicated above.</li></ul><p>For further information on or to request a copy of the aforementioned safeguards, please email help@curiositystream.com.</p><p> <strong>I.

However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice with respect to promotional communications; if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on the Sites or if you do not want us to share your personal information with third parties.

At this time, global standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT. We do not sell data in the traditional sense of a "sale" but we do utilize third party advertising vendors who may use information collected through our Sites to track users. We do not recognize all DNT signals but we do recognize the Global Privacy Control.</p><p>For Google Analytics:&nbsp; To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics and have implemented all Google Advertising Features, including Remarketing, Impression Reporting, and Demographics, and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics uses cookies to report on user interactions on our and others' websites. We use the data collected for optimizing marketing, refining advertising and/or programming strategies, and generally making advertising more effective. We will not undertake such activities without your consent where such consent is required under applicable law.

When we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on the Sites as required by applicable law so that you have the opportunity to exercise your rights.</p><p> <strong>P. Security and Retention</strong></p><p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide us. We may use third party products and services to secure or store your information. Please understand that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to CS is done at your own risk. We use firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p><p>If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using these Sites or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of these Sites. We may post a notice on our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p><p>The personal information record created through your registration with our Sites can only be accessed with the unique password associated with that record. To protect the integrity of the information contained in this record, you should not disclose or otherwise reveal your password to third parties. You agree that you are responsible for all acts or omissions that occur on your account while your password is being used. Please let us know immediately if you believe your password has been compromised.</p><p> <strong>Q. Retention</strong></p><p>We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and services you have requested. Afterwards, we may retain data for an appropriate period to protect ourselves from legal claims, to administer our business, or to the extent permitted by applicable law, which may require us to hold your personal information for specific periods. We will delete your personal information when you withdraw your consent, if there is no other legal ground for further processing (e.g., a statutory obligation to retain your personal information), or when you object to the processing in accordance with Section I (see above) or when we are obligated to delete it in accordance with an obligation under applicable law.
