SECTION 18 ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, IN ADDITION TO PROCEEDING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE DISPUTE WOULD BE RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN IN COURT. SECTION 18 DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE A USER BASED IN GERMANY.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You understand and agree that the Sites are provided to you on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis. We disclaim all responsibility and liability for the availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Sites, the accuracy of any opinion or information contained on the Sites, or the availability and reliability of any software on the Sites. The opinions expressed on the Sites are not necessarily the opinions of CS or its employees and may or may not be totally accurate. The content provided through the Sites is for educational and informational purposes only. The Sites are not intended to provide tax, legal, accounting, financial, or any other form of professional advice.</p><p>Certain areas, features, or functionality of the Sites may be subject to different or additional terms, rules, guidelines or policies ("Additional Terms"), and we may provide such additional rules to you via postings, pop-up notices, links, or any other means, or otherwise in the manner required by applicable law, at the time that you access or use the relevant area, feature or functionality and, if you are a user based in Germany, before a contract is concluded. From time to time, such additional rules may conflict with these Terms of Use. In the event of such a conflict, the Additional Terms will control. Any reference to the "Terms of Use" in this agreement includes the Additional Terms.</p><p> <strong>1. Ownership of the Sites</strong></p><p>The Sites contain copyrighted material, trademarks and other proprietary information, including videos, comments, articles, information, catalogs, brochures, data, text, software, photos, and graphics ("Content"). This Content is subject to copyrights and/or other intellectual property or proprietary rights owned by CS and other individuals or entities and is protected by United States and international intellectual property laws.</p><p> <strong>2. Use of CS Content</strong></p><p>WE ARE PROVIDING YOU WITH ACCESS TO THE SITES PURSUANT TO A LIMITED, NON-EXCLUSIVE, NON-SUB-LICENSABLE, NON-TRANSFERABLE, AND REVOCABLE LICENSE. UNDER THIS LICENSE, YOU MAY USE THE SITES AND THE CONTENT SOLELY FOR PERSONAL, NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, AS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. More specifically, you may use the Sites and the Content for, and only for, (i) your personal use or (ii) bona fide educational purposes in a classroom or academic setting. In either case, CS authorizes you to view a single copy of the Content as made available on the Sites.&nbsp;</p><p>For avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances may the Sites or Content be used (i) in or for any commercial or for-profit manner or purpose or (ii) for the purpose of, or with the intention of initiating, future litigation or arbitration, including using the Sites in order to trigger or induce an alleged violation of any law. You understand and agree that by accepting these Terms of Use, you are representing to CS that you are agreeing to the specific provisions herein, and that you understand and accept how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information and/or other information concerning your use of the Sites pursuant to our Privacy Policy (<em>see</em>Section 15). You further understand and agree that CS is justifiably relying on your representation in order to provide you access to the Sites. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use and the practices described in our Privacy Policy, DO NOT USE THE SITES, PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION OR OTHER PRODUCT, AND/OR PROVIDE US WITH ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. If you later take legal action inconsistent with your representations, you understand and agree that such action will constitute evidence that your representations to CS were false when they were made to CS, and that your representations were made to defraud CS. Use of the Sites for the foregoing purposes is strictly prohibited, exceeds the parameters of the license set forth in this section, and, as such, constitutes a breach by you of these Terms of Use. You further understand and agree that in such circumstances, CS can elect to void this agreement, without prejudice to CS's ability to seek damages, expressly including CS's attorneys' fees, from you resulting from your breach of these Terms of Use and/or the fraudulent conduct described above. Further, such use of the Sites is not authorized under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and we reserve the right to bring legal action against you in connection with any such violations.&nbsp;</p><p>You may not either directly or through use of any device, software, internet site, web-based service, or other means, modify, publish, transmit, stream, upload, display, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit the Content of these Sites or any portion of such Content except as expressly provided herein. You may not use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the Content, frame any portion of the Sites or Content, or reproduce, reprint, copy, store, publicly display, broadcast, stream, transmit, modify, translate, port, publish, sublicense, assign, transfer, sell, loan, or otherwise distribute the Content without our prior written consent. You may not circumvent any mechanisms included in the Content for preventing the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Content. You may not introduce viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs that interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; or damage, disable, overburden, impair, or gain unauthorized access to the Sites, including CS's servers, computer network, or user accounts.</p><p>Any use of the Content not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate U.S. or international copyright, trademark, and/or other laws. If you violate these Terms of Use, your permission to use the Content automatically terminates.</p><p> <strong>3. Video Content on the Sites&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The primary purpose of the Sites is to make available to consumers educational, informational and entertainment video content, audiovisual content, and content of a like nature (collectively, the "Video Content"). In connection with our provision of Video Content, the Sites may utilize online targeting technologies and code-based tools, including but not limited to social media pixels, Software Development Kits ("SDKs"), and cookies (i.e., advertising or analytics cookies) that track information about your activity and webpage-viewing history on the Sites (collectively, "Targeting Tools") in order to recommend, both on the Sites and on third-party sites, tailored Video Content and to gauge performance of Video Content, the Sites and CS in general.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting Tools on the Sites may result in information about your activity on the Sites being transmitted from your browser to CS and third parties, which, in turn, may result in the display of targeted advertisements on third-party websites and platforms, including advertisements for CS content. You hereby acknowledge and agree that our use of certain Targeting Tools is integral to our provision of Video Content and to fulfill the purpose of your subscription, and is done in the "ordinary course of business," as defined in the Video Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C.A. § 2710) ("VPPA"). Without limiting the foregoing, you further understand and agree that, when you visit a particular webpage on the Sites that contains Video Content, the fact that you visited that particular webpage is distinct from whether you requested or obtained specific Video Content on such webpage. Thus, you understand and agree that, for the purposes of the VPPA and any similar laws, rules, or regulations, CS is <strong>not </strong>disclosing whether you have requested or obtained specific video materials or services from CS by virtue of CS's using Targeting Tools that share information with third parties as to whether you have viewed particular webpages on the Sites.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, whether Targeting Tools on the Sites result in your browser's transmission of information to third parties depends on a number of factors that may be outside of CS's knowledge or control, including what third-party websites you use, what information you have provided to such third parties, and whether (and the extent to which) you have limited the use of cookies by the operators of those third-party websites. <strong>AS SUCH, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, IF TARGETING TOOLS ON THE SITES RESULT IN YOUR BROWSER'S TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES, (I) SUCH TRANSMISSIONS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A "KNOWING DISCLOSURE" OF "PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION" BY CS UNDER THE VPPA AND (II) YOU WILL NOT INITIATE ANY LITIGATION OR OTHERWISE ASSERT ANY CLAIM AGAINST CS BASED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ON SUCH TRANSMISSIONS, WHETHER UNDER THE VPPA, THE CALIFORNIA INVASION OF PRIVACY ACT (CAL. PENAL CODE § 630 ET SEQ.) ("CIPA"), OR ANY OTHER STATUTE, REGULATION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION.</strong></p><p> <strong>4. Trademark Rights</strong></p><p>The names, trademarks, service marks, and logos of CS belong exclusively to CS and are protected from reproduction, imitation, dilution or confusing or misleading uses under national and international trademark and other intellectual property laws. All other trademarks, service marks, and logos (including third-party product names) are the property of their respective owners. Use of these trademarks in an infringing manner is expressly prohibited and nothing stated or implied on the Sites confers on you any license or right under any trademark of CS or any third party.</p><p> <strong>5. Subscriptions, Billing, and Cancellation</strong></p><p> <strong>A.</strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>Paid Subscriptions</strong> </span>. Many aspects of the Sites and the services offered thereon require payment before they can be accessed or used ("Paid Subscriptions"). While Paid Subscription options will vary from time to time, they will require you to pay a recurring fee on a monthly, bi-annual, or annual basis, or at some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to purchase (the "Subscription Period").</p><p>Your Paid Subscription will typically be subject to Additional Terms presented to you prior to purchase. Importantly, Paid Subscriptions typically will not provide access to all services owned and operated by CS. By way of example, a Paid Subscription offer presented on the Curiosity Stream website usually will not entail access to Curiosity University content or services.&nbsp;<strong>Please carefully review the terms of the applicable offer before registering for a Paid Subscription.</strong>&nbsp;We may change the price of Paid Subscriptions from time to time, but we will communicate any price changes to you in advance in the manner required by applicable law (if any) and, if applicable, we will tell you how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next Subscription Period.</p><p>By registering for a Paid Subscription, you authorize us to charge your credit card or other account that you have designated, on a recurring basis, for the applicable subscription fee at the then current rate plus applicable tax. All fees are charged in US Dollars (USD).</p><p> <strong>B. </strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>Auto-Renewal and Cancellation</strong> </span> <strong>. The subscription fee for a Paid Subscription will be billed at the beginning of your Subscription Period or expiration of your free trial period, if any. Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until they are cancelled as described below. This means that, after your initial Subscription Period, and again after any subsequent Subscription Periods, you will automatically be billed for an additional period of the same length. For example, if you select a monthly subscription, you will be billed for an additional month at the beginning of the next month, and then for each month after that, until you cancel your subscription.</strong></p><p> <strong>You may cancel your subscription at any time by logging into your account on the Sites or contacting us at help@curiositystream.com. You have the right to cancel your subscription without fee or penalty at any time. If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current Subscription Period. After cancellation, you will have continued access to the applicable content and/or services for the remainder of the current Subscription Period, but you will not receive any refund, unless otherwise stated at the time of cancellation.

THIS SECTION 18 DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE A USER BASED IN GERMANY (PLEASE SEE SECTION 22 UNDER "CHOICE OF FORUM" REGARDING GERMAN-SPECIFIC TERMS).</p><ol> <li>Informal Dispute Resolution&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In the event of any Dispute, you and CS agree to first attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each party a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve the Dispute informally. Specifically, the party with the complaint (the "<strong>Complaining Party</strong>") shall send written notice to the other party (the "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute (each such notice being a "<strong>Dispute Notice</strong>").&nbsp;</p><p>All Dispute Notices must: (1) be personally signed by the Complaining Party; (2) include the Complaining Party's name, physical address, and email address; (3) describe with specificity the nature and basis of the Dispute in a manner sufficient for the Receiving Party to evaluate the merits of the Complaining Party's individualized claim, (4) include any documentation in the Complaining Party's possession or control (including, without limitation, documentation that is in the possession of a third party which is accessible to you) supporting the Complaining Party's position in the Dispute; and (5) set forth the alleged damage and harm suffered and the specific relief sought with a calculation for it. Each Dispute Notice is limited to a single Dispute between you and CS. As such, your Dispute and the Disputes of other parties may not be combined into a single Dispute Notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dispute Notices shall be sent:</p><ul> <li> <strong>To CS:</strong> You must send notice (1) by electronic mail to help@curiositystream.com and (2) by first-class or certified mail to Curiosity Inc., 8484 Georgia Ave., Suite 700, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Attn: Legal</li></ul><ul> <li> <strong>To You:</strong> We will send notice by (1) first class or certified mail to the physical address we have on file for you (if any) and (2) by electronic mail to the email address we have on file for you (if any).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>You and CS will attempt to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days beginning on the date that a valid Dispute Notice is sent (the "<strong>Informal Negotiation Period</strong>"). During the&nbsp; Informal Negotiation Period, the parties are required to conduct an individual meet-and-confer in person, or via teleconference or videoconference, that addresses only the Dispute between you and CS (the "<strong>Conference</strong>"). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference, but you will also need to participate. CS will participate in the Conference through one or more representatives, which may include our counsel.&nbsp;</p><p>Both you and CS agree that the foregoing informal dispute resolution procedures (the "<strong>Informal Resolution Process</strong>") is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or arbitration against the other party. If any aspect of the Informal Resolution Process has not been satisfied, the parties agree that (i) a court of competent jurisdiction can enjoin the filing or prosecution of any litigation or arbitration and (ii) unless prohibited by law, no arbitration administrator shall accept or administer an arbitration or demand fees in connection with the Dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol> <li>Individual Litigation&nbsp;</li></ol><p>If, at the end of the Informal Negotiation Period (and not before), and only after the completion of the Conference, the Dispute has not been resolved, then the Dispute shall be resolved by a court located in the state of Maryland, and you hereby agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any Disputes.&nbsp;</p><p>YOU AND CS FURTHER AGREE TO BRING AND MAINTAIN ANY SUCH LITIGATION SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT BOTH YOU AND CS HEREBY AGREE NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY LITIGATION AGAINST THE OTHER AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION OR OTHERWISE IN A CONSOLIDATED, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. FURTHER, YOU AND CS EACH HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LITIGATION.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol> <li>Individual Arbitration</li></ol><p>IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION DETERMINES THAT SECTION 18.B OF THESE TERMS (INDIVIDUAL LITIGATION) IS INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, YOU AND CS AGREE THAT THE DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE IN COURT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS.&nbsp;</p><p>All such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect (as modified by these Terms of Use), before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/"><span style="color:rgb(5, 99, 193);">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/</span></a>) (the "<strong>Minimum Standards</strong>") if, and only if, it is determined by JAMS that the Minimum Standards are applicable to the Dispute. The location of any hearings will be determined by the applicable JAMS rules, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose to have the arbitration conducted (1) solely on the basis of the documents submitted to the arbitrator or (2) through a non-appearance based hearing by teleconference or videoconference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Use, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use are void or voidable. For the avoidance of doubt, you and CS agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of this agreement to arbitrate or the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.&nbsp;</p><ol> <li>Small Claims and Intellectual Property Rights&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms of Use, either you or CS may (1) bring an individual claim or elect to resolve a Dispute in small claims court in the United States consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits (so long as (a) any such claim is brought and maintained on an individual basis and (b) the action is litigated in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction) and (2) file an individual claim in court to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of its intellectual property rights (so long as any such claim is brought and maintained on an individual basis). Both parties understand and agree that either party may elect to resolve as much of a Dispute within the jurisdictional limits of a small claims court as possible, even if such small claims court would not have the authority to award a party all the relief it is requesting.&nbsp; For example, if a party's claim for monetary damages falls within the jurisdictional limits of a small claims court with jurisdiction over the parties, either party may elect to resolve this aspect of a Dispute in such small claims court, even if such court could not issue any injunctive relief requested by a party.&nbsp; In addition, nothing in these Terms of Use prohibits you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).&nbsp;</p><p> <strong>19. Modification &amp; Termination</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Use at any time.

Such remedy may be requested by you, unless this would be impossible or would impose costs on us that would be disproportionate, taking into account all the circumstances of the case including: (i) the value the services would have if there were no lack of conformity; and (ii) the significance of the lack of conformity.</li></ul><p>Where (i) the remedy above is impossible or disproportionate; (ii) we have not brought the services into conformity in accordance with the paragraph above; (iii) a lack of conformity appears despite our attempt to bring the services into conformity; (iv) the lack of conformity is of such a serious nature as to justify an immediate price reduction or termination of the Terms of Use; or (v) we have declared that we will not bring the service into conformity within a reasonable time, or without significant inconvenience for you, you are entitled to receive a proportionate reduction in the price with reference to Paid Subscriptions or to terminate the Terms of Use as described above under "Termination". The reduction in price shall be proportionate to the decrease in the value of the services which were supplied to you compared to the value that the services would have if they were in conformity. The reimbursement of the above reduction shall be made by us (i) without undue delay and, in any event, within 14 days of the date on which we are informed of your decision for a price reduction according to the above or to terminate the Terms of Use and (ii) using the same means of payment as you used to pay for the Paid Subscription, unless you expressly agree otherwise and provided that you not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p><ul> <li> <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>&nbsp;In deviation from Section 12, unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, we shall be liable for a breach of contractual and non-contractual obligations in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. We shall be liable for damages - irrespective of the legal grounds - within the framework of fault-based liability in the event of intent and gross negligence.</li></ul><p>In the event of simple or slight negligence, we shall be liable, subject to statutory limitations of liability (e.g., due care in own affairs; insignificant breach of duty) only</p><p>a. for damages arising from injury to life, body, or health (i.e., death or personal injury); and</p><p>b. for damages arising from the breach of a material contractual obligation (obligation, the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for the proper performance of the contract and on the observance of which the contractual partner regularly relies and may rely); in this case, however, our liability shall be limited to compensation for the foreseeable, typically occurring damage.</p><p>These limitations do not apply in case of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, if we have fraudulently concealed a defect, have given a guarantee of quality, or have assumed a procurement risk.</p><p>Furthermore, any mandatory statutory liability, in particular under the German Product Liability Act, shall remain unaffected. The limitations of liability resulting from this section shall also apply to our executive bodies, legal representatives, employees, staff and vicarious agents and/or other persons for whose fault CS is responsible in accordance with statutory provisions.</p><ul> <li> <strong>Assignment.</strong>&nbsp;You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Use without our express prior written consent.

If you later take legal action inconsistent with your representations, you understand and agree that such action will constitute evidence that your representations to CS were false when they were made to CS, and that your representations were made to defraud CS. Use of the Sites for the foregoing purposes is strictly prohibited, exceeds the parameters of the license set forth in this section, and, as such, constitutes a breach by you of these Terms of Use. You further understand and agree that in such circumstances, CS can elect to void this agreement, without prejudice to CS's ability to seek damages, expressly including CS's attorneys' fees, from you resulting from your breach of these Terms of Use and/or the fraudulent conduct described above.

You hereby acknowledge and agree that our use of certain Targeting Tools is integral to our provision of Video Content and to fulfill the purpose of your subscription, and is done in the \"ordinary course of business,\" as defined in the Video Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C.A. § 2710) (\"VPPA\"). Without limiting the foregoing, you further understand and agree that, when you visit a particular webpage on the Sites that contains Video Content, the fact that you visited that particular webpage is distinct from whether you requested or obtained specific Video Content on such webpage.

Importantly, Paid Subscriptions typically will not provide access to all services owned and operated by CS.

This means that, after your initial Subscription Period, and again after any subsequent Subscription Periods, you will automatically be billed for an additional period of the same length.

After cancellation, you will have continued access to the applicable content and/or services for the remainder of the current Subscription Period, but you will not receive any refund, unless otherwise stated at the time of cancellation.
