<h4><strong>7. YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO YOUR CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION</strong></h4>
<p>CPNI is information made available to us solely by virtue of our relationship with you that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, geolocation data, and amount of use of the telecommunications services you purchase from us, as well as information related to the billing for those services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPNI does not include subscriber list information such as name, postal address, or telephone number. Under federal law, you have the right, and we have the duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. When we share your CPNI with our service providers or contractors, we require them to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of that information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are permitted to use or disclose your CPNI for certain purposes without further notice or consent from you, including: to provide you with our Services; to market service offerings to you related to the services you purchase; to protect us, you, other subscribers, and other carriers from fraud, abuse, or unlawful use of the Services; and in an aggregate form. We also may use your CPNI, or share it with affiliates and third-party agents, for the purpose of offering you communications-related products and services, packages, discounts, and promotions that may be different from the types of services you have already purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to opt out of use of your CPNI for marketing purposes and can submit an opt-out request by contacting us by calling 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at <a href="https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us">https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us</a>.

You may also contact us to correct your CPNI or request that we disclose your CPNI to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not disclose your CPNI except when provided with your password, and we may implement other authentication measures. If you do not provide a password, we may not release your CPNI to you except by sending it to your address of record or by calling you at your telephone number of record. Be sure to use a strong password with our Services and not one you use for other services. We may disclose your CPNI to any &ldquo;authorized user&rdquo; that you have designated to us in writing or to any person who is able to provide us with your password.</p>

<h4><strong>9. HOW WE STORE, RETAIN, AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU, AND HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>
<p>Access Wireless has implemented technology and security features, such as encryption, to safeguard the privacy of your customer specific information from unauthorized access or improper use and will continue to enhance our security measures as technology becomes available. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as foolproof security on the Internet, and therefore, Access Wireless makes no guarantees with regard to the sufficiency of our security measures.</p>
<p>We will keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to provide your Services, or as otherwise required by federal or state law, subpoena, or court order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FCC regulations require us to keep:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Affordable Connectivity Program (&ldquo;ACP&rdquo;) records for as long as an ACP participant receives a discount but no less than six (6) years.</li>
    <li>911 call data for two (2) years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Personal Information we collect from or about you is stored on servers which we take commercially reasonable efforts to secure in the United States (&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;), subject to the laws of the U.S. Electronic access to the databases and physical access to the servers on which this Personal Information is stored are restricted to those employees, agents, contractors, service providers, and other third parties who have a business need for such access. They will only access and use your Personal Information based on our instructions and they are required to keep your Personal Information confidential. While we take reasonable steps to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and servers, we cannot guarantee their security, nor can we guarantee that your communications and information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over our underlying carrier&rsquo;s network or the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Personal Information is stored on servers in the U.S.; however, some of our service providers may store information on servers hosted in other countries. As such, your Personal Information may be subject to the laws of other countries, where the data protection and other laws may differ from those of the U.S. Should your Personal Information be transferred to other countries, we will require our service providers to protect your Personal Information. Your Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate.</p>
<p>Access Wireless may assign you a user ID and a password when you as part of your participation and access to the Site and your account. Only you may use your user ID and password. You may not share your user ID and password with anyone else, and you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of your user ID and password. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user ID. You play a role in protecting your information as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>10. GOVERNING LAW AND NOTICE TO NON-U.S. RESIDENTS</strong></h4>
<p>Our Services are solely intended for individuals located within the U.S. and its territories and are subject to U.S. law. If you are located outside of the U.S. and its territories, please do not use the Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not reside in the U.S. and provide Personal Information to us, please note that your Personal Information will be transferred, processed, collected, used, accessed and/or stored in the U.S. and subject to U.S. laws. The laws in the U.S. may not provide the same protections for your Personal Information as the jurisdiction in which you are located. Do not provide your Personal Information to us if you do not want this information to be transferred or processed outside of your country, or if the laws in your country restrict such transfers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>11. INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong></h4>
<p>Our Services are not directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in California).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a minor, please do not provide us with any Personal Information or use or access the Services without receiving your parent&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s permission. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in California), we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Information provided by a child under 13 (or under the age of 16 in California), or if you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 (or under the age of 16 in California) that has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us by calling 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at <a href="https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us">https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us</a>.</p>

That information may be collected and stored by our service providers and provided to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>12. ACCESS WIRELESS AND VARIOUS STATE PRIVACY LAWS</strong></h4>
<p>We are not subject to the defined scope of many state privacy laws, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (&ldquo;VCDPA&rdquo;), the Colorado Privacy Act (&ldquo;CPA&rdquo;) or the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (&ldquo;CDPA&rdquo;), and therefore the specific rights and obligations identified in these laws do not currently apply to us. However, residents of these states may refer to these Privacy Policy provisions regarding our current data practices and may contact us regarding data inquiries or further information requests via the Our Contact Information section below. We also recognize that privacy laws continue to evolve rapidly, so we are undertaking reasonable means to monitor developments in these laws and update our polices accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>13. CALIFORNIA RESIDENT PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></h4>
<p>California residents have certain additional rights under the CCPA as described below, to the extent that we:</p>
<p>(i) generate over $25 million in annual gross revenue;</p>
<p>(ii) process the personal information of at least 100,000 California consumers; or</p>
<p>(iii) generate 50% or more of our annual revenues from the sale or sharing of personal information.</p>
<p>You may inquire whether these thresholds have been met by contacting us at 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at <a href="https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us">https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us</a>. To the extent the threshold has been met, you may exercise these rights.</p>
<p>This section explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information about users, customers, and visitors who reside in California (&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;). It also explains certain rights afforded to consumers under California&rsquo;s Shine the Light law and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;), as revised and updated by the California Privacy Rights Act (&ldquo;CPRA&rdquo;). This section uses certain terms that have the meaning given to them in the CCPA including personal information. &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; for purposes of this Privacy Policy is as defined by applicable laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following section does not apply to individuals who do not live in California on a permanent basis, individuals who do not collect personal information about, or individuals for whom all of the information we collect is exempt from California laws.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a contractor or service provider for a business purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that prohibits any such contractor or service provider from selling or sharing your Personal Information. Any such contract requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
<p>During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have disclosed the categories of Personal Information about you for a business purpose as described in the <strong>How </strong>We Share or Allow Access to Your Personal Information section above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>13.5. Sale and Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell or share your Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the definitions of Personal Information, &lsquo;share,&rsquo; and &lsquo;sale&rsquo; under CCPA are broad. The CCPA defines &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; as &ldquo;communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&rsquo;s personal information&rdquo; to &ldquo;a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for money or other valuable consideration.&rdquo; We may share your Personal Information with a third party to help serve personalized content or ads that may be more relevant to your interests, and to perform other advertising-related services such as enabling our partners to serve such personalized content.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have shared the following categories of Personal Information as follows:</p>

    <div class="sfContentBlock sf-Long-text" ><p style="text-align:center;">Access Wireless is a service provider for the government-funded Lifeline Assistance program. Lifeline service is provided by i-wireless LLC, d/b/a Access Wireless, an eligible telecommunications carrier. Lifeline service is non-transferable. Only one
Lifeline discount, consisting of either wireline or wireless service, can be received per household. A household is defined, for the purposes of the Lifeline program, as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address and
share income and expenses. Violation of the one-per-household rule constitutes a violation of FCC rules and will result in the customer&rsquo;s de-enrollment from the Lifeline program. Consumers who willfully make false statements in order to obtain a
Lifeline benefit can be punished by fine or imprisonment or can be barred from the program. Customers must present proper documentation confirming their eligibility for the Lifeline program. Customer information will be validated against public records
and any discrepancies could result in your approval or rejection of service.</p></div>

<div class="mt-3" >
    <div class="sfContentBlock sf-Long-text" ><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP):</strong></p><p style="text-align:center;">The ACP is a government benefit program operated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that provides discounts on monthly broadband Internet access service and certain connected devices. The ACP monthly service and device discounts are non-transferrable.
    An eligible household is limited to one monthly service discount and a one-time connected device discount. To receive a connected device, a co-payment greater than $10.00 and less than $50.00 is required and is based on device availability. Only one per household is eligible for the ACP program. Eligibility for the ACP will be determined by the National Verifier, administered by the Universal Service
    Administrative Company (USAC). ACP discounts can be applied to any available Access Wireless service plans. Our standard Terms and Conditions, including the Acceptable Use Policy, apply. ACP benefits may be obtained from any participating provider
    of your choosing. You are limited to one ACP benefit transfer transaction per service month, with limited exceptions for situations where a subscriber seeks to reverse an unauthorized benefit transfer or is unable to receive service from a specific provider. </p><p style="text-align:center;">*Access Wireless will provide eligible households with unlimited voice and unlimited data. Unlimited data includes a fixed amount at high-speed. &ldquo;High-Speed&rdquo; means maximum available network speeds. After monthly allotted high-speed data, remaining data provided at 256 kbps - 64 kbps. Video typically streams in SD (480p). Lower speeds may affect audio and video streaming, access to certain websites and
    content, or use of available applications. Offers may vary by state and service may not be available in all areas. To see plan details, go to <a href="http://accesswireless.com" data-sf-ec-immutable="">accesswireless.com</a></p></div>
