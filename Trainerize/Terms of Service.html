                <p>If Trainerize elects to suspend your Account, the Site and/or the Service for a significant period of time, Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the period of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services. You will not receive any such refund in the event that Trainerize is suspending your Account, the Site and/or Service to you as a result of your breach of this Agreement in which case, to the extent permitted by law, Trainerize will have no liability whatsoever for any damages, liabilities, losses or any other consequences that you may incur as a result.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>You may cancel your Account at any time through the interface provided as part of the Service. Cancellation must be issued via the interface. This is the only way to cancel your Account. Email requests (from email accounts other than your Trainerize email account) or phone requests to cancel your Account may not be accepted. If you elect to cancel your Account for convenience, you will not be provided with a refund, in whole or in part, of any pre-paid amount. If you cancel your Account because you allege that we are in breach of this Agreement, and you are able to provide satisfactory evidence in support of the allegation, then Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services as a result of your cancellation for cause. You will remain liable for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of cancellation, including full fees for the then current subscription period in which you cancelled your Account.</p>

In these circumstances, Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription period during which you will not receive the Services as a result of Trainerize&rsquo;s termination for convenience. Trainerize will not be required to provide 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice in the event that it:</p>

                <p>You may cancel your Account at any time through the interface provided as part of the Service. Cancellation must be issued via the interface. This is the only way to cancel your Account. Email requests (from email accounts other than your Trainerize email account) or phone requests to cancel your Account may not be accepted. If you elect to cancel your Account for convenience, you will not be provided with a refund, in whole or in part, of any pre-paid amount. If you cancel your Account because you allege that we are in breach of this Agreement, and you are able to provide satisfactory evidence in support of the allegation, then Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services as a result of your cancellation for cause. You will remain liable for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of cancellation, including full fees for the then current subscription period in which you cancelled your Account.</p>

                <p>If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole will not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from this Agreement.</p>

            <li>
                <p>You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Agreement if Trainerize agrees in writing. Trainerize may transfer its rights under this Agreement at any time without restriction provided that such assignment will not affect your rights or obligations under this Agreement.</p>

            <li>
                <p>This Agreement is the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in this Agreement. This Agreement replaces and supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreement, representation or discussion, oral or written, and may not be changed except in writing signed by us, regardless of whether or not the parties act under an unsigned &quot;electronic&quot; agreement or rely on such an unsigned agreement.</p>

                <p>Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it does not rely on and shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Agreement. Each party agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this Agreement.</p>

            <li>
                <p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each party at its own cost agrees to do and execute and perform such further deeds, documents, assurances, acts and things as may be required to give effect to the terms, intent and purposes of this Agreement.</p>
