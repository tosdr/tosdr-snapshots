You may not sign-up for multiple Accounts in order to receive additional benefits under any Trial Programs.

        <p><strong>CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>You may cancel your Account at any time through the interface provided as part of the Service. Cancellation must be issued via the interface. This is the only way to cancel your Account. Email requests (from email accounts other than your Trainerize email account) or phone requests to cancel your Account may not be accepted. If you elect to cancel your Account for convenience, you will not be provided with a refund, in whole or in part, of any pre-paid amount. If you cancel your Account because you allege that we are in breach of this Agreement, and you are able to provide satisfactory evidence in support of the allegation, then Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services as a result of your cancellation for cause. You will remain liable for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of cancellation, including full fees for the then current subscription period in which you cancelled your Account.</p>

In these circumstances, Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription period during which you will not receive the Services as a result of Trainerize&rsquo;s termination for convenience. Trainerize will not be required to provide 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice in the event that it:</p>

            <li>
                <p>Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it does not rely on and shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Agreement.

                <p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unless it expressly states otherwise, this Agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement.</p>
