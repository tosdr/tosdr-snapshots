<p>These Terms and Conditions apply to web sites and interactive services (hereafter individually a “Service” and collectively the “Services”) owned or operated by FACE IT LIMITED (hereafter the “Company” or “FACEIT”) and its subsidiaries and affiliates. By registering for an account and/or becoming a member to participate in any game or tournament offered on faceit.com and/or any of its subdomains (hereafter the “Site”) you confirm your knowledge of and agreement to be bound by the then most current version of these T&amp;C, which can be accessed from the Site. FACEIT may modify these T&amp;C at any time, without advance notice. You are responsible for reviewing these T&amp;C periodically for any modifications. Your continued use of the Site following such modifications signifies your acceptance of those modifications. Additional terms may apply to your use of any Service, including contest rules and eligibility. We will provide these terms to you or post them on the website pages to which they apply; they are incorporated by reference into these T&amp;C. If there is a conflict between these T&amp;C and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control. The section titles used in these Terms are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.</p>
<p>As set out in more detail below, FACEIT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND AND/OR CLOSE THE ACCOUNT OF ANY MEMBER WHO VIOLATES, OR WHOM FACEIT REASONABLY BELIEVES MAY BE OR WILL BE VIOLATING, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. Please note that if a member’s account is closed due to a violation of the T&amp;C, FACEIT reserves the right to determine how the member’s account balance will be distributed.</p>
<p>If any provision of these terms and conditions is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the invalidity of that provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall continue to have full force and effect. No person other than the parties to these terms and conditions are intended to benefit from them pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>

<h3>Governing law and disputes</h3>

We nevertheless retain the right to bring proceedings against you for any threatened or actual breach of these terms and conditions in your country of residence, registration or business or any other relevant country. By registering for an account and/or participating in any challenge or tournament offered on the Site, you agree that any dispute that cannot be resolved between the parties shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.

<h3>Copyright infringement &#8211; Digital Millennium copyright act</h3>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe in good faith that materials hosted by Company infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Company a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked by providing Company’s Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online web site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that website;</li>

<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the Company to contact you, such as a name,address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address;</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Company a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to this website should be sent to: FACE IT LIMITED, 25th Floor, Millbank Tower, 21-24 Millbank, London, SW1P 4QP, England.
