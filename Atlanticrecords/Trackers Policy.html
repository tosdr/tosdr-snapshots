  <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
  <h2></h2>

<p>This Cookies Policy describes how cookies and similar technologies are used on our websites and web properties (e.g., widgets and applications) that contain or link to this Cookies Policy (which are referred to in this policy collectively and individually as the “Site”). It is intended to operate with and be read together with the cookies banner and privacy preference center that link to it.</p>
<p>“We” (or “us” or “our”) means Warner Music Inc. or the relevant member of our group that operates the specific Site (as indicated on the Site or in our Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>We may change this Cookies Policy from time to time, so please check back periodically for updates.  This Cookies Policy was last revised on the date specified at the top of the policy.</p>


<h3>1. What is a Cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of information that the Site’s server transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your device so that the contents of that cookie can be retrieved and read.</p>
<p>Cookies do not usually record your name or specific contact details, but some cookies may assign an identifier to an individual. To the extent that cookies collect and process personal data, this is handled in accordance with our <a href="https://www.wminewmedia.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>There are other technologies we use on the Site that work in a similar way to cookies by storing or accessing information on a user’s device, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 local storage – this is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain.</li>
  <li>Local Shared Objects – this is commonly called a “Flash cookie” and is a piece of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer, typically to support website advertisements and videos.</li>
  <li>Device fingerprinting – this is a way of identifying a unique device by combining certain attributes of the device, without necessarily having to know the IP address or setting cookies.</li>
  <li>Scripts – these are lists of commands executed by programs or scripting engines, which are used to generate Web pages and to automate computer processes.</li>
  <li>Tracking pixels / web beacons – these are small pieces of code loaded when a user visits a website, which can be used to track site visits, user behaviour, ad impressions and other online activities.</li>
  <li>Plugins – these are add-ons for a program that adds functionality to it – for example, a plugin is used to enable you to watch a video on the Site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. How we use Cookies</h3>
