</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage, and Tags.</em>
</p>

<strong><u>Supplemental Information for California Residents</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
If you reside in California, we are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;) (collectively, &#8220;California Privacy Law&#8221;) to provide you with information about how we used and disclosed your personal information in the preceding 12 months. You may also have certain rights with regard to your personal information. We have included this California-specific information below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CA Personal Information.</strong>We may collect certain categories and specific pieces of information about individuals that are considered &#8220;personal information&#8221; in California (&#8220;CA Personal Information&#8221;). Specifically, we may collect the following categories of CA Personal Information: identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and inferences.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sources of CA Personal Information.</strong>We may collect this CA Personal Information from you and other third parties such as service providers, business partners, or other third party vendors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Purposes of Collection.</strong>We collect and use CA Personal Information for the following business purposes:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
to provide the functionality of the websites and related services you may request including maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, or providing similar services;
</li>
<li>
for short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, the contextual customization of ads or website content shown as part of the same interaction;
</li>
<li>
for analytics purposes (such as determining how many users use one of our websites, when, what portions of websites and contents are used, user demographic information, the sites referring to our websites and sites to which users may navigate);
</li>
<li>
to market and/or advertise our goods and services, or the goods and services of others, to you;
</li>
<li>
to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for that activity;
</li>
<li>
to debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
</li>
<li>
to conduct internal research and development for new services and features related to our business;
</li>
<li>
to undertake activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by, us and to improve, upgrade, or enhance our services; and
</li>
<li>
to advance our commercial or economic interests, such as by referring you to other sites and services by us, our affiliated business units, or other third parties for which we may receive payment.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Selling, Sharing and Disclosing CA Personal Information.</strong> We do not sell your CA Personal Information as that term is traditionally understood. However, some of our disclosures of CA Personal Information may be considered a &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;share&#8221; as those terms are defined under California Privacy Law. Under California Privacy Law, a &#8220;sale&#8221; is broadly defined to include a disclosure for something of value, and a &#8220;share&#8221; is broadly defined to include a disclosure for cross-context behavioural advertising. We disclose your CA Personal Information as follows:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
We shared the above categories of CA Personal Information with third-party vendors and business partners to provide you with cross-context behavioral advertising.
</li>
<li>
Apart from the above, we disclosed the above categories of CA Personal Information as described in the &#8220;Information We Disclose with Others&#8221; section above, such as to service providers, third-party vendors, business partners and other third parties.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not knowingly disclose the CA Personal Information of individuals under 16 years of age, in a manner that constitutes a &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;sharing&#8221; under California Privacy Law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CA Sensitive Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
Certain CA Personal Information that we collect about you may be considered sensitive personal information within the meaning of California Privacy Law, including: your account log-in, password and precise geolocation (if you have this enabled). We only use and disclose sensitive personal information as described in the &#8220;Our Treatment of Sensitive Personal Information&#8221; section above, including as necessary in connection with the performance of services and the provision of goods, compliance with federal, state, or local laws, and as otherwise permitted by California Privacy Law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention of CA Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
We retain your CA Personal Information as described in the &#8220;Retention of Personal Information&#8221; section above, for so long as necessary and required to support our services to you and for a reasonable period of time after that as necessary for our legal compliance obligations. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject to; or (iii) as advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Rights under California Privacy Law</strong>
</p>
<p>
Subject to certain exceptions detailed in California Privacy Law and other applicable laws and regulations, as a California resident, you have the right to: (i) request to know/access your CA Personal Information, including the specific pieces and the categories of CA Personal Information we have collected or shared about you and the categories of sources from which we have collected the CA Personal Information; (ii) request deletion of your CA Personal Information; (iii) receive information about the CA Personal Information about you that we have &#8220;sold&#8221; to (as such term is defined under California Privacy Law) or &#8220;shared&#8221; with third parties within the past 12 months, including the categories of third parties; and (iv) request correction of your CA Personal Information; (iv) opt-out of the &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;sharing&#8221; of your CA Personal Information, as such terms are defined under California Privacy Law; and (v) limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information to purposes specified in Cal. Civil Code 1798.121(a). We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in Cal. Civil Code 1798.121(a).
