        Effective as of the date of your Order for any of the Services noted in
        Section 3, Your appropriate Authorized Users are granted a limited,
        non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, non-exclusive, personal license

        Services that You have subscribed for the right to access and utilize,
        solely as permitted by this Agreement, during the Term. The term
        “appropriate” here means that Services intended for use by individual
        users may be accessed and utilized by the Authorized User, Services
        intended for use by students may be accessed and utilized by any
        Authorized User, and that Services intended for use by teachers, staff,

        elect for that Service and the applicable license pricing for the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>

        appropriate purposes, We may permit Authorized Users in excess of the

        that Service (“Additional Users”).
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time during the Term, We will compare the number of
        Authorized Users You have provided with access to a Service with the
        number of Licensed Seats You have subscribed for that Service. If the
        number of Authorized Users exceeds the number of Licensed Seats You have
        subscribed for the Service, We will notify You in writing and invoice
        You for the Additional Users We have identified through Our comparison.
        We will work with You to resolve promptly any question or issue You may
        have regarding the number of Additional Users We have identified or the
