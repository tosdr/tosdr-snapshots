    <p>
      This is the Global Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) of Charmtech
      Labs LLC (&quot;Company,&quot; “we,” “our” or “us”) for use of the Capti
      application (&quot;App”), captivoice.com website (&quot;Site&quot;),
      Products, the servers the Site is stored on including without limitation
      by use through an API, or the computer files stored on that server
      (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;). We want our visitors to learn
      about our Services, and we help educators, researchers, parents, students,
      and other authorized users to easily put our Services<b> </b>to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Privacy Policy we describe the information we may collect about
      you through our Services (as defined in our
      <a href="/capti-site/public/entry/terms_of_service">Terms of Use</a>), how
      we use that information, circumstances in which we share it, how we
      protect it, and the rights and choices you may have with regard to your
      information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing or
      using our Services. By accessing or using any of our Services, you accept
      and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
      Privacy Policy, do not access or use our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our
      <a href="/capti-site/public/entry/terms_of_service">Terms of Use</a>. Any
      capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the definitions
      set forth in the
      <a href="/capti-site/public/entry/terms_of_service">Terms of Use</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event we add future Services that affect the terms of this Privacy
      Policy, we will revise accordingly. References to “you” or “your” pertain
      to all our site visitors, registered users, or our members throughout this
      Privacy Policy.

    </h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell “Personal Information” as that term is commonly defined in
      applicable privacy laws. We use reasonable efforts to protect information
      that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated
      with, or could reasonably be linked with you or your household (your
      “Personal Information”).
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that when users provide Personal Information to an organization it
      is an act of trust. That trust is something we take seriously. We work to
      ensure that the Serviced observes compliance standards for online privacy,
      security, business practices, honest transactions, and availability. This
      Privacy Policy explains the steps we take to protect Personal Information
      shared with us through the Services or when you otherwise interact with
      us, including how we collect it, who has access to it and what is done
      with it.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Some information is collected automatically when you use our Services.
      This information may not on its own reveal your name or contact
      information, but it may include device and usage information, such as your
      IP address, browser, device characteristics, operating system, language
      preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
      about how and when you use our Services and other technical information.
      This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
      operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting
      purposes, however we also use this information to improve our Services, to
      determine which features of our Services are most popular with our users,
      and to otherwise better understand our users’ preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Cookies </b>(or browser cookies). “Cookies” are small text files that
        are placed on your device by a Web server when you access our Services.
        Please see our <a href="/capti-site/public/entry/cookie_policy">Cookie Notice</a> for more
        details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Web Beacons</b>. Pages of the Services and our e-mails may contain
        small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear
        gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to
        count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for
        other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity
        of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Do Not Track.</b>
        Please note that our Services do not currently respond to browser-based
        “do not track” signals. We will respond to any similar signals in the
        future as may be required by applicable law.

    </h2>
    <p>
      We collect Personal Information from and about you when you voluntarily
      provide it to us, in addition to Personal Information and other data we
      collect automatically when you visit the Services. Depending on the
      website you have accessed, or the other ways in which you interact with
      us, we may collect different types of information as outlined below.
    </p>

    <h3>Site Users</h3>
    <p>
      Some of our Services enable you to register to create an account. If you
      do this, we will collect your name, username or email address, and
      password you provide. On some Services we may also request additional
      Personal Information associated with your account (such as your company
      name, school, or other data). We use this information in connection with
      your account and your use of our Services. We may also use this
      information to contact you regarding the Services you are using and other
      Company Services we believe would be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any user of our Services wishing to obtain support must provide an email
        address. Without this information we cannot answer your questions. When
        submitting a support question to us you must not only provide a valid
        email address, but also first and last name, US state if applicable,
        country, role, and your specified request. Some of our Services offer
        multiple levels of access, some of which may require users to register
        or purchase a subscription, and others which are available without
        registration or subscription. Differences between levels of access may
        require corresponding differences in data collection practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you purchase a subscription to one of our Services, you must provide
        a valid email address and password. Some Services may additionally
        require role (educator, parent, researcher), country, US state, and
        company.
      </li>
      <li>
        For certain subscriptions, we may also require that you provide billing
        information to our payment processor Service Providers, AppStore and
        PayPal. For PayPal, you enter billing information through our Site, but
        we do not retain such information. We also use Intuit QuickBooks to bill
        administrators directly for our Services. Note that qualifying educators
        in partner states can subscribe to some of our Services for free and
        thus without the need to provide billing information. All registered
        users may voluntarily submit additional personal information, like their
        first and last name, into their profile information and select mailing
        lists to which they wish to subscribe.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may offer limited time, seasonal, early or limited access, special
      purpose or demonstration versions of our Services. In such cases we may
      collect additional information, tied to the registrant’s email, role,
      country, and state. Where applicable, we may permit users to provide
      student data in order to customize the registered user’s use of the
      offered Services. Some such Services allow registered users to provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Student name or nickname</li>
      <li>Completed grade level</li>
      <li>Classes registered for</li>
      <li>Ability level (e.g., in reading, writing, etc.)</li>
      <li>School District or state</li>
      <li>
        Demographic information (sex, race, free and reduced lunches, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>Performance measurement results</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Paid Subscriptions and Financial Information</h3>
    <p>
      If you need to submit a payment to us via credit or debit card, we use
      Intuit QuickBooks for invoice payment, AppStore for in-App purchases on
      iOS, and PayPal for any purchases via
      <a href="http://www.captivoice.com/">www.captivoice.com</a>. Intuit
      QuickBooks processes credit and debit cards via QuickBooks website; we
      have no access to card information. AppStore purchases are charged to the
      card you have on file with Apple; we have no access to card information.
      However, for PayPal payments, you will enter the card information on our
      Site—we securely pass it along to PayPal, but we do not retain such
      information. We encourage you to review the PayPal privacy policy at

    </p>
    <p>
      In any event, when you enter into a paid subscription for one of our
      Services, sensitive credit card data is exchanged using direct and
      indirect communication between these payment processors and you. We do not
      collect, control, see or store any of the card data exchanged with these
      payment processors.

      Certain pages on some of our Services enable you to submit inquiries or
      requests to us. These Services collect Personal Information when users
      complete an inquiry or request for more information using our online form.
      These forms typically collect the following information: first and last
      name, phone number, email address, organization name, organization type,
      areas of interest. We may share this information with our third-party
      service providers, including storing the information in cloud-based
      contact management systems, and providing the information to third parties
      who assist us with our email marketing and other communications.
    </p>

    <h3>Handling Audio Recordings</h3>
    <p>
      You may be able to submit audio recordings to some of our Services, e.g.,
      audio notes, voiceover, pronunciation analysis, etc. These Services may
      enable users to record themselves reading a presented passage or to upload
      an audio file of themselves or others reading. When we collect oral
      reading samples, data collected may include the reader’s grade (if a
      student), date and time of the recording, and prior ability information
      used to calculate current oral reading ability. Information we send back
      as a result of the analysis may also be linked to data or files retained
      in our system. We may use a Third-Party provider for automated speech
      recognition (ASR) and/or analysis. Once processed, an informational oral
      reading ability measure is displayed, the recognized text is stored. We do
      not process audio data for the purposes of deducing or inferring any
      special characteristics that are restricted by law or regulation about the
      reader. We do not use audio content for any purpose other than as
      described above, and audio content is not used to uniquely identify you.
    </p>

    <h3>Children’s and Adult Information Collected</h3>
    <p>
      We collect personal information directly from children and adults through
      our Services. We may receive data provided by a parent regarding their
      child, or by a state, school district or teacher containing information
      regarding a child or groups of children; however, any group information is
      aggregated and anonymized. If a student minor is a resident of Colorado,
      Quebec, UK or the European Union, we will require prior parental consent
      to process any non-anonymized information and to transfer it to our
      servers outside their home residency.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are logging in through a school district facilitated program, we
      have assumed that the school district or school has procured consent to
      process yours or your child’s personal information. However, if you are
      direct subscriber, we need prior parental consent for minors or your
      consent. If you believe that we have collected yours or the Personal
      Information directly from a child under the age of 13 (in the U.S.) or 16
      (typically the applicable age in European countries) without following the
      proper procedures, please notify us immediately via email to
      <a href="mailto:privacy@captivoice.com">privacy@captivoice.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collected from Children under Age 13</h3>
    <p>
      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules
      (collectively, &quot;COPPA&quot;) require us to inform parents and legal
      guardians (as used in this policy, &quot;<b>parents</b>&quot;) about our
      practices for collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information from
      children under the age of 13 (&quot;<b>children</b>&quot;). It also
      requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child's parent for certain
      collection, use, and disclosure of the child's Personal Information.
      Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy Supplement for information about
      the Personal Information that we collect from or about Children under Age
      13.

    </h2>
    <p>
      We may collect limited data from schools with which we have a
      relationship, public databases, marketing partners, and other outside
      sources. All Personal Information that you provide on or to a Third Party
      or that is collected by a Third Party is provided directly to the
      controller, owner or operator of the Third Party and is subject to the
      owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We do not monitor or control any
      data you provide to Third Parties. Thus, we are not responsible for the
      content, privacy or security practices of a Third Party. To assure the
      protection of your Personal Information, we recommend that you carefully
      review the privacy policies of any Third Party you access. You assume the
      risk of providing any information you provide to a Third Party.

    <p>
      No. We do not sell your Personal Information, and as such you do not have
      to Opt-in or Opt-out of any sale of information requirements under the

    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to operate our Services, it may sometimes be necessary to
      disclose Personal Information with contractors and other service
      providers. For example, we may share Personal Information with the
      companies that host our Services (such as AWS), provide analytics and
      other functionality on our Services, host or provide our database of
      current and potential customers, help us send emails and other
      communications, or provide other services to us. In addition, we may share
      Personal Information with individual contractor scientists and software
      developers as may be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted above, we use third-party Service Providers to analyze audio
      recordings. When the recording is submitted to the third party for
      processing, no other personal identifiers are shared. Results from the
      third party are combined with our own processes to calculate the reader’s
      proficiency results. In doing so, we connect the proficiency results with
      the Personal Information you provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we digitize documents you upload to our Services, we use a
      third-party Optical Character Recognition (OCR) service to process such
      documents; no personal identifiers are shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Service Providers are bound by a legal contract to keep Personal
      Information confidential. They can use Personal Information only for the
      purposes for which we disclose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check this Privacy Policy regularly for updates on other Service
      Providers that may be used in connection with our Services or contact us

      <b>Fulfilling your requests. </b>Some of our Services include the ability
      for you to share content or information with third parties you designate.
      If you give us an email address to use the “share” feature within a tool,
      we will transmit the contents of that email and your email address to the
      recipients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Affiliated entities and corporate transactions. </b>We may share
      Personal Information with<b> </b>our current or future subsidiaries and
      affiliates in order to streamline provision of our Services or for other
      business purposes. In addition, if we contemplate a merger, divestiture,
      restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of
      some or all of our assets, it is possible that we would need to share
      Personal Information with another organization during the due-diligence
      process, following the transaction, or otherwise in connection with a
      corporate event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Legal proceedings. </b>We may also share Personal Information to comply
      with a court order, law or legal process. This includes a government or
      regulatory request. Before we do that, we would provide the user with
      notice of the requirement. If the user so chooses, a protective order or
      another remedy could be sought. If after providing that notice we still
      must share the demanded Personal Information, we will share no more than
      that portion of Personal Information which, on the advice of our legal
      counsel, the order, law or process specifically requires us to share.
      Note, some of these disclosures may be made to governments that do not
      ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Information as your
      home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any
      obligation) object to the disclosure of your Personal Information to such
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Other parties.</b>
      We may share Personal Information with third parties as we deem

    </h2>
    <p>
      In general, we keep Personal Information as long as it is reasonably
      necessary in connection with the purpose for which it was provided, and
      for which parental consent has been received. For Personal Information
      collected through our Services for account registration and subscription
      payment purposes, we will keep such information for as long as a Member
      maintains registration and or subscription in good standing. Once those
      registrations or subscriptions lapse or terminate, unless a written
      agreement between us and a member provides otherwise, we may keep Personal
      Information for as long as needed only to meet regulatory requirements or
      business requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will ensure that all Personal Information that constitutes an
      “Educational Record” (as defined by the Family Educational Rights and
      Privacy Act (FERPA)) in our possession and in the possession of any
      subcontractors, or agents to which we may have transferred Educational
      Records, are destroyed or transferred to the School/District under the
      direction of the School/District when the Educational Records are no
      longer needed for their specified purpose, at the request of the
      School/District.”

      We process your Personal Information in accordance with applicable data
      protection laws. If you are subject to the GDPR, we process Personal

      example, when you voluntarily provide Personal Information to us, we

      have some or all of the following rights and choices in general:
    </p>
    <h3>General Regional Rights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Access Rights: </i>You may have the right to receive certain
        information, such as the following (these rights, and the applicable
        types of data and time periods, will vary depending on the laws
        applicable to the state or country in which you reside):

        <ol>
          <li>
            The categories of Personal Information we have collected or
            disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information;
            the business or commercial purpose for collecting your Personal
            Information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared
            Personal Information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to and/or a copy of certain Personal Information we hold
            about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some circumstances, you may have the right to obtain certain
            Personal Information in a portable format.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Erasure: </i>You may have the right to request that we delete certain
        Personal Information we have about you. We may either decide to delete
        your Personal Information entirely, or we may anonymize or aggregate
        your Personal Information such that it no longer reasonably identifies
        you, and may use it to improve our Services. Certain Personal
        Information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For
        example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our
        Services to you, we may be required to retain certain information for
        legal purposes, and there may be other reasons we may need to keep
        certain Personal Information under various applicable laws. In addition,
        if you ask us to delete your Personal Information, you may no longer be
        able to access or use some of our Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Correction: </i>You may have the right to request that we correct
        certain Personal Information we hold about you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Limitation of Processing: </i>Certain laws may allow you to object to
        or limit the manner in which we process some of your Personal
        Information, including the ways in which we use or share it. For
        example, you may have these rights if the processing was undertaken
        without your consent in connection with our legitimate business
        interests (although we may not be required to cease or limit processing
        in cases where our interests are balanced against your privacy
        interests).
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Regulator Contact:</i><i> </i>You may have the right to contact or
        file a complaint with regulators or supervisory authorities about our
        processing of Personal Information. To do so, please contact your local
        data protection or consumer protection authority.

      <li>
        <i>Postings by Minors: </i>Users of our Services under the age of 18 in

        content they have posted on one of our Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Other: </i>You may have the right to receive information about the
        financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You may also have the
        right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable
        law) for exercising certain of your rights.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you believe that you have specific rights under your jurisdiction and
      you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a support
      request through our Site or email us at privacy@captivoice.com. Other than
      marketing opt-out you will be required to verify your identity before we
      fulfill your request. In certain jurisdictions, you may be able to
      designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, subject to
      certain requirements of your applicable law. We may require that you
      provide the email address we have on file for you (and verify that you can
      access that email account) as well as an address, phone number, or other
      data we have on file, in order to verify your identity. If an agent is
      submitting the request on your behalf, we reserve the right to validate
      the agent’s authority to act on your behalf, and we may be required to
      take additional verification measures under applicable law.

    <h3>Important Information for European Union and United Kingdom Users</h3>
    <p>
      If you are a user from the European Union or United Kingdom you should be
      aware that we are the controller of your Personal Information (Data
      Controller) under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the
      UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), and such similar laws
      promulgated in the various EU countries.
    </p>

      <li>
        have your personally identifiable information erased (“right to be

      </li>
      <li>
        withdraw your consent to our processing of your information at any time,
        if our processing is based on consent;
      </li>
      <li>
        object to our processing of your information, if our processing is based
        on legitimate interests;
      </li>
      <li>
        object to our processing of your information for direct marketing
        purpose; and

      </li>
      <li>
        the right to transmit your information to another controller without
        hindrance from us (data portability).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is no charge for any of these requests. To make a request, please
      contact us at
      <a href="mailto:privacy@captivoice.com">privacy@captivoice.com</a>. We try
      to respond to such requests in a timely manner, but in no event longer
      than one month.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we collect your Personal Information, we maintain and store it for as
      long as we determine reasonably necessary to provide our Services to you,
      unless you exercise your right to erasure described above, or to comply
      with applicable legal requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a citizen of the European Union or United Kingdom, when we
      process your Personal Information, we will only do so in the following
      situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have a contractual obligation.</li>
      <li>
        You have provided your consent. You are able to remove your consent at
        any time, and you may do this by contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@captivoice.com">privacy@captivoice.com</a>.
      </li>
      <li>We have a legal obligation.</li>
      <li>
        We have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Information.
        For example, we may process your Personal Information to send you
        marketing communications, relevant content, products or events
        invitations, or to communicate with you about changes to our Services,
        and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should be aware that Personal Information that you provide to us may
      be transferred out of the country in which you reside to servers in a
      country that may not guarantee the same level of protection as the one in
      which you reside. We do this for a legitimate business purpose in
      providing the Services as permitted under UK and EU privacy laws, and
      therefore specific consent is not required under the EU and UK legal
      schema. Nevertheless, out of abundance of caution, we are asking for your
      consent, especially when it comes to processing the data of minor
      children. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
      Personal Information is treated securely in accordance with this Privacy
      Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Information will take place to a
      third party unless there are adequate controls in place to protect your
      Personal Information and/or you have provided contractual consent by
      becoming a client.

    <p>
      If you are a user in the European Union or United Kingdom and have a
      concern about our processing of personal information that we are not able
      to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy

    <p>
      We have reasonable safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to,
      disclosure of, or misuse of your Personal Information. However, we cannot
      guarantee that your Personal Information will never be shared or otherwise
      processed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example,
      as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable
      law or our
      <a href="/capti-site/public/entry/terms_of_service">Terms of Use</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you register for a membership with any Services we offer, you will be
      asked to select a password to help protect your Personal Information.
      These passwords help us verify your identity before granting access or
      making corrections to any of your Personal Information. You should never
      share your password with anyone. The Company will never ask you for your
      password in a phone call or email. You are responsible for maintaining the
      secrecy of your passwords and any account information. We also offer for
      your convenience single sign-on via various Service Providers, including
      Google, Clever, ClassLink, Schoology, Canvas Blackboard, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      When subscribing to certain Services you also provide your credit card
      information. It is transmitted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology
      to help prevent unauthorized access or misuse of that information.
      (PCI-compliance requires following the Transport Layer Security 1.2
      rules.) SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an
      encrypted link between a web server and a browser. Make sure you see a
      full “lock” symbol and https in the status bar of your browser. Browsers
      like Firefox 123 and above, Google Chrome 122 and above, Safari 16 and
      above employ some version of the lock symbol to indicate security. If the
      lock symbol is not visible, do not enter any information. Direct any
      issues or concerns to our support community for further guidance at
      privacy@captivoice.com.

      Finally, the computers/servers in which we store Personal Information are
      kept in a secure environment. However, please note that to the extent your
      Personal Information is shared with a Service Provider or other third
      party, we cannot guarantee, nor will we be responsible for, the security
      measures of those third parties.

      Privacy Notice for Children Under the AGE of 13
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Last modified: April 1, 2024</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules
      (collectively, &quot;COPPA&quot;) require us to inform parents and legal
      guardians (as used in this [policy/section], &quot;<b>parents</b>&quot;)
      about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal
      information from children under the age of 13
      (&quot;<b>children</b>&quot;). It also requires us to obtain verifiable
      consent from a child's parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure
      of the child's personal information.
    </p>

    <p>This policy notifies parents of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The types of information we may collect from children.</li>
      <li>How we use the information we collect.</li>
      <li>Our practices for disclosing that information.</li>
      <li>
        Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents' consent when we
        collect personal information from children, including how a parent may
        revoke consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        All operators that collect or maintain information from children through
        the Sites.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This policy only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements
      our Capti Global Privacy Policy. Only our general privacy policy applies
      to teens and adults.
    </p>

    <p>
      Terms that are defined in the general privacy policy have the same
      meanings as used in this Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13.

        >Information We Collect from Children</span
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      Children can access many parts of the Site and its content and use some of
      its features without providing us with personal information. However, some
      content and features are available only to registered users and require us
      to collect certain information, including personal information, from them.
      In addition, we use certain technologies, such as cookies, to
      automatically collect information from our users (including children) when
      they visit or use the Site.
    </p>

    <p>
      We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably
      necessary for the child to participate in an activity, and we do not
      condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal
      information than is reasonably necessary.

      <span class="support_step_text">Information We Collect Directly</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A child must provide us with the following information to register for our
      Services: email, first and last name, and password. The child does not
      need to provide the real name, but the email needs to be valid (for
      individual users) and the email does not need to be valid for an education
      account. We may request additional information from your child, but this
      information is optional. We specify whether information is required or
      optional when we request it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain features of our Services enable registered users to record their
      voice, such as audio transcription or recording of their own content, or
      of third-party content such as books.<b> (“Audio Content”) </b>Creation
      and use of the Audio Content results in the temporary collection and
      recording of a voice audio file. We only use the audio files generated
      from the Audio Content to assess students’ aural reading, as well as to
      improve assessment capability, and do not make other uses of the audio
      files. We keep the associated audio files for as long as the education
      account is active, or we can delete them at any time upon the request of
      the school.

      technologies with personal information about you or your child that we
      collect online.
