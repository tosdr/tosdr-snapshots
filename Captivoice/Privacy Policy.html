<p>Charmtech Labs LLC ("Charmtech") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all Charmtech’s products, which includes Capti Accommodate, Capti Assess, Capti Higher Ed, Capti Personal, Capti Advance and captivoice.com website (collectively: "Capti"), and describes the types of personal information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our use of the information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. We are compliant with all federal, state, and local regulations.</p>

<h2 class="support_step">
<span class="support_step_title">1</span>
<span class="support_step_text">Information We Collect</span>
</h2>

<h3>A. Personal Accounts</h3>

<p>In order to use any of Charmtech’s products, a user account is required. During the account registration, Charmtech will request your name, a username, an email address, and a password. Additionally, during purchases other than those made on the iOS AppStore, Charmtech will request your payment information which will be processed via PayPal. Charmtech does not retain cardholder data, and Charmtech payment processing system is PCI compliant.</p>

<p>Capti enables you to add content to a Playlist, which is stored only on your device by default. You may synchronize your Playlist to back up the Playlist and/or share it between your devices or with other users; these functionalities are enabled by storing a copy of your playlist on Charmtech servers.</p>

<p>You may choose to log in to 3rd party sources such as Dropbox and Google Drive to add their content to your Playlist. Charmtech servers do not receive the content of your sources. However, if you synchronize your Playlist, the Playlist data will be sent to the Charmtech server.</p>

<p>Charmtech applications provide conversion of many file types to speech. Certain file types are processed on Charmtech servers. When a user converts a file (including files accessed via the Internet) to speech, the contents of that file, including any personal information therein, may be processed, but are not stored, on the Charmtech servers, unless you synchronize your Playlist.</p>

<p>In addition, when you visit our website (captivoice.com), we collect certain information by automated means, including cookies. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits. A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.</p>

<p>Charmtech may also collect, compile and analyze aggregate user data ("Aggregate User Data"), including user behavioral patterns in accordance with this Privacy Policy to improve Charmtech’s services. </p>

<p>Users can request to have their stored data deleted at any time. Stored data will be deleted upon request. </p>

<h3>B. School/Organization Accounts</h3>

<p>Charmtech products, including but not limited to Capti, are sold to schools and educational institutions as a package that includes a specified number of licenses. These licenses are accepted by administrators or teachers on behalf of students. <p>

<p>When an administrator or teacher creates an account on behalf of a student, Capti requests the following information. First name, Last name, and email address. If a student does not have an email address, Capti will provide a system email address to use as their username. This allows students to access and interact with the platform. Charmtech does not store any other data, including protected student records, on their servers at any time. </p>

<p>In compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations, a parent or guardian of a student using any Charmtech product on behalf of their school or educational institution may request to view, manage, or delete any information held on the Charmtech servers in relation to their child. If the guardian chooses to delete the data, the child will no longer be permitted to use Capti, or any other Charmtech product, without parental consent.</p>

<p>Teachers and administrators can view assignments, tracks uploaded to student’s playlists, and the scores they achieved on assigned tests. </p>

<h3>C. ETS ReadBasix</h3>

<p>Capti Assess is a reading diagnostic product that can be purchased independently or jointly with other Capti products. Capti Assess is powered by ETS ReadBasix, an assessment that was designed and is owned by Educational Testing Service. Educational Testing Service reserves the right to collect the following information from ETS ReadBasix for research purposes.</p>

<p>ETS uses anonymized and pseudonymized information for various research initiatives. For example, ETS may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Similarly, educational apps, such as Capti, collect data to help ETS understand and improve reading skills. ETS's research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias. ETS also seeks to improve teaching, learning and assessment.</p>

<p>At no time does ETS receive any PII (Personal Identifiable Information) from Charmtech. If a parent or guardian requests their child’s data be removed from ETS, you will be required to contact ETS. Charmtech is not liable for any information stored on ETS servers. </p>

<p>By purchasing a license or multiple licenses of Capti Assess, you are accepting that Educational Testing Service will collect data for research purposes. </p>

<h3>D. Other Applications</h3>

<p>Some applications may require Capti to request permissions to access your account. Below is information we access from such applications. At no time will Capti have access to your password in another application. These permissions apply to both Personal and School/Organization accounts.</p>
