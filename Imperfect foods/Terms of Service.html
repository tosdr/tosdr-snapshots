You are solely responsible for inspecting all Products for any damage or other issues upon delivery. We recommend that you use a food thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of any meat, poultry, or seafood is 40° F or below. If you believe that any Products are not suitable for consumption, do not consume the items, and contact us <a class="link" target="_self" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">We recommend that you immediately refrigerate all perishable Products upon delivery and follow the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s (“USDA”) instructions on refrigeration and food safety, which can be found <a class="link" target="_self" href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/" rel="noopener">here</a>, and the USDA&#x27;s instructions on safe food handling, which can be found <a class="link" target="_self" href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Orders, Subscriptions, and Cancellation</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">a. Shopping Windows; Orders.</span> Once you create your account, you may be able to select your preferred delivery day, or you will otherwise be notified of your delivery day for your orders. After your delivery day has been set, you will also be assigned a shopping window in advance of your delivery day, during which you will be able to add or remove Products to your order, which we also call “building your box.”</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Your shopping window to build your box will remain open until 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, at which time your order will automatically be placed if your cart contains Products meeting the applicable order minimum communicated to you at the time of enrollment (your “Order Minimum”), excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions (an “Order”). Your current Order Minimum may thereafter be updated from time to time upon notice to you as described in the “Notices” section below, and you will be able to see your Order Minimum in the “My Plan” section of your Account Home page. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">You will be able to see your shopping window dates, billing date, and delivery date for your next Order listed on your Account Home page. If you wish to start shopping prior to the start of your next shopping window and place an Order on an earlier delivery date, certain customers may have the option to do so on the “Upcoming Deliveries” section of your Account Home page, which will change your default delivery day to the new delivery day shown on that page. If you elect to change your default delivery day, you will be able to view your new shopping window dates, billing date, and delivery date listed on your Account Home page.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">b. Grocery Subscription; Continuous Subscription.</span> </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">i. Grocery Subscription Order Process.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">When you create your account, YOU ARE AGREEING THAT MISFITS MARKET WILL POPULATE YOUR CART WITH PRODUCTS SELECTED BY US AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SHOPPING WINDOW UNTIL YOU CANCEL. The value of the Products populated in your cart will be within the dollar value range described to you at the time of account creation (excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions) or such other dollar value range as we otherwise thereafter specify by written notice to you in a manner described hereunder. We may refer to this program interchangeably as your “Grocery Subscription,” “Grocery Plan” or your “subscription” with us.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">After your cart has been populated by Misfits Market, you will be able to view your pre-populated cart and have the opportunity to customize your cart further by adding or removing Products to your order at any time prior to the close of your shopping window as shown on your Account Home page. You may also skip your upcoming order through the “Delivery Schedule” section of your Account Home page at any time prior to the close of your shopping window.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If your cart continues to meet your Order Minimum of Products (excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions) as of 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, your Order will automatically be placed. We may place a pre-authorization hold on your payment method for the estimated total of your Order on the day after your shopping window closes, and your payment method will be charged in full when we pack your Order, at which point we will authorize the release of any excess amounts held.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">ii. Consent to Continuous Subscription.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">By registering for an account, you expressly acknowledge and agree that (A) YOU ARE SIGNING UP FOR A CONTINUOUS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL YOU CANCEL THROUGH A CANCELLATION METHOD DESCRIBED IN SECTION 5(d) BELOW, (B) BY RETAINING A MINIMUM SUBTOTAL OF YOUR ORDER MINIMUM OF PRODUCTS WITHIN YOUR CART AS OF 11:45 P.M. EASTERN TIME ON THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SHOPPING WINDOW, MISFITS MARKET (OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE YOU AT THE PRICES LISTED FOR SUCH PRODUCTS WHEN THE ORDER IS PLACED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, SHIPPING CHARGES, AND OTHER CHARGES AS REFLECTED IN YOUR CART FOR THE ORDER) and (c) the amount you are charged and the number and assortment of the Products you receive each delivery cycle will vary based on the Product selections made by Misfits Market and/or you.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Once your Order has been placed, you will no longer be able to add, remove, or substitute any Products in your Order. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE CHARGED FOR YOUR CURRENT ORDER, YOU MUST EITHER REMOVE PRODUCTS FROM YOUR CART TO REDUCE THE CART SUBTOTAL BELOW YOUR ORDER MINIMUM OR SKIP OR PAUSE YOUR ORDER IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED IN SECTION 5(d) BELOW PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF YOUR APPLICABLE SHOPPING WINDOW FOR THAT ORDER, in which case an Order will not be placed for that upcoming delivery date and your payment method will not be charged. Certain customers may be able to use our Late Cancel feature prior to the close of your Late Cancel Window for that Order if that feature is made available to you as described in Section 5(d) below.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">iii. Updating your Grocery Subscription.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">The dollar value range of the Products that will be populated in your cart at the start of each shopping window (excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions, your “Plan Range”) will be described on the “Plan Summary” section of your “My Plan” page. You may modify your Plan Range by clicking on the “Edit” button in the “Plan Summary” section of this page as further described below.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">For certain customers, you will have the ability to set your Plan Range for your Grocery Subscription by selecting between certain designated dollar ranges. For example, we may give you the option to have your cart pre-populated with thirty-five to forty dollars ($35-$40) worth of Products per Order, or forty to forty-five dollars ($40-$45) worth of Products per Order. If you are one of these customers, these Plan Range options will be displayed for you and you will be able to update your selection by clicking on the “Edit” button and selecting the dollar range of Products that you wish to have pre-populated for each Order’s shopping window. By modifying your selection and clicking the “Update” button, your Plan Range selection will thereafter apply once your next shopping window opens, and you are consenting to this new Plan Range for your Grocery Subscription.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">For other customers, you will have the ability to select your cart preferences (i.e., the specific Product categories that will be populated within your pre-populated cart). You may also have the ability to indicate how many people you are shopping for. Each Product category that you select under the “Cart Preferences” heading will have a starting price associated with it (if applicable, such starting price will be based on the number of people you have indicated you are shopping for), and the price of Products that are populated in your cart from each Product category in any given Order will be within a reasonable range of such starting price. The aggregate dollar range of all Product categories that you select will determine your total Plan Range. If you are one of these customers, your “Plan Summary” section of the “My Plan” page will indicate both your Plan Range and the Product categories that you have selected under the “Cart Preferences” heading, and when you click on the “Edit” button you will see that each Product category within the selection window has its starting price range identified next to it. To edit your Plan Range and Cart Preferences, click the “Edit” button and you will be able to designate both the specific Product categories to be populated in your pre-populated cart (as well as the number of people you are shopping for, if applicable), and these selections will update your expected Plan Range as displayed at the top of the “Plan Settings” section. Please note that you will be required to select a sufficient number of Product categories to meet your Order Minimum, and you will be prompted to select additional Product categories if your Order Minimum is not satisfied based on your selections. By modifying your selections and clicking the “Update” button, your Plan Range and Cart Preferences selections will thereafter apply once your next shopping window opens, and you are consenting to this new Plan Range for your Grocery Subscription.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Finally, some customers will have the ability to indicate how many people you are shopping for and then select your cart preferences (i.e., the specific Product categories that will be populated within your pre-populated cart), but these Product category selections will not affect your total Plan Range. Rather, for these customers the Plan Range will only be impacted by the number of people you indicate you are shopping for. If you are one of these customers, your “Plan Summary” section of the “My Plan” page will indicate both your Plan Range and the Product categories that you have selected under the “Cart Preferences” heading, but when you click on the “Edit” button you will not see specific prices identified for individual Product categories and your new Product category selections will not update your total Plan Range at the top of the “Plan Settings” section. If this applies to you, please note that because your Plan Range will not update, the number of Products that are pre-populated in your cart from any Product category will generally decrease if you increase the total number of Product categories that you want to receive. To update your Product category selections or the number of people you are shopping for, click on the “Edit” button and make your selections. If you update the number of people you are shopping for, you will see an updated expected Plan Range at the top of the “Plan Settings” section. By modifying your selections and clicking the “Update” button, your Plan Range and Cart Preferences selections will thereafter apply once your next shopping window opens, and you are consenting to this new Plan Range for your Grocery Subscription.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Certain Grocery Subscription customers may also be able to update your Order frequency from weekly to every other week by clicking “Edit” under the “Delivery Settings” section of your “My Plan” page. If you elect to change your Order frequency to every other week, you will be able to view your new shopping window dates, billing dates, and delivery dates listed on your “Upcoming Deliveries” section of your Account Home page.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">c. Flex Plan.</span> For certain existing Misfits Market customers or for customers who have cancelled their Grocery Subscription, you will still be permitted to shop with Misfits Market by manually adding or removing all Products to your cart during any open shopping window.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">For these Flex Plan customers, if you have added at least your Order Minimum of Products (excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions) to your cart as of 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, your Order will automatically be placed. We may place a pre-authorization hold on your payment method for the estimated total of your Order on the day after your shopping window closes, and your payment method will be charged in full when we pack your Order, at which point we will authorize the release of any excess amounts held.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you are a Flex Plan customer, by continuing to use the Services (including by adding Products to your cart) you expressly acknowledge and agree that (a)<span class="font-grotesk-bold"> by adding a minimum subtotal of your Order Minimum of Products to your cart as of 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, Misfits Market (or our third-party payment processor) is authorized to charge you at the prices listed for such Products when the Order is placed as described above (in addition to any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges as reflected in your cart for the Order) </span>and (b) the amount you are charged and the number and assortment of the Products you receive each delivery cycle will vary based on the Product selections made by you.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Once your Order has been placed, you will no longer be able to add, remove, or substitute any Products in your Order. If your cart does not contain at least your Order Minimum in Products (excluding any applicable taxes, shipping charges, and other charges or Promotions) as of 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, an Order will not be placed for that upcoming delivery date and your payment method will not be charged.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">d. Skipping your Orders; Cancelling or pausing your Grocery Subscription or account; Upgrading to a Grocery Subscription.</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">Customers on a Grocery Subscription can skip an upcoming Order in the “Delivery Schedule” section of your Account Home page at any time before 11:45 P.M. Eastern Time on the last day of your shopping window, or by contacting us <a class="link" target="_self" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact" rel="noopener">here</a> at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the close of the shopping window for the Order you wish to skip.</span> If you are a Flex Plan customer, your upcoming Order will automatically be skipped unless you meet your Order Minimum as described above.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">Except as set forth below, you cannot cancel, pause, skip, or alter an Order after your shopping window has closed for that Order, even if you haven’t been charged for that Order or that Order hasn’t shipped yet. For more information, please read our <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://help.imperfectfoods.com/articles/-r1WXTk_o" rel="noopener">Cancellation Policy</a>.</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">For certain customers, you may be permitted to use our “Late Cancel” feature, which allows you to cancel your Order after the close of your shopping window but prior to the time we have begun fulfilling your Order (your “Late Cancel Window”). If you are one of these customers, our Late Cancel feature will be displayed to you on the “Orders” section of your Account Home page next to your most recent Order, and you can use the Late Cancel feature by clicking the “Need to cancel” button for that Order and following the prompts to cancel, in which case you will not receive an Order from that shopping window and any pre-authorization holds on your payment method will be refunded. If you are one of these customers but the “Need to cancel” button is not displayed next to your most recent Order, you are no longer within your Late Cancel Window and cannot cancel your Order. We cannot guarantee the duration of your Late Cancel Window or that it will remain available for the same duration from Order to Order. If you wish to use the Late Cancel feature for an Order, we recommend that you attempt to cancel your Order as soon as possible once you realize that you wish to cancel your Order. For these customers, you cannot cancel an Order after your Late Cancel Window has closed, even if you haven’t been charged for that Order or that Order hasn’t shipped yet.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you are enrolled in a Grocery Subscription, you can pause your subscription for a designated period of time or cancel your subscription by downgrading to a Flex Plan at any time in the “My Plan” section of your Account Home page or by contacting us <a class="link" target="_self" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact" rel="noopener">here</a> at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the billing date of your upcoming Order. If you cancel your subscription by downgrading to the Flex Plan, you will still be permitted to shop with Misfits Market during your open shopping window and will only be charged for Orders when you manually add Products to your cart as further described in Section 5(c) above. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you wish to completely cancel your account while on the Flex Plan, you may do so through the “My Plan” section of your Account Home page or by contacting us here.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">If you are enrolled in the Flex Plan, you will be eligible to upgrade your account to subscribe to a Grocery Subscription at any time through the “My Plan” section of your Account Home page.</span> If you upgrade to a Grocery Subscription, your Order process will be as further described in Section 5(b) above.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">e. Food Preferences.</span> Grocery Subscription customers can help us better customize your Order by using the “Food Preferences” section of your Account Home page. You can see the Products that you have previously ordered under the “Past Items” tab and designate these Products as “Recurring” items, as “Liked” items, or as “Never” items. To remove any of these Products for their Food Preferences designation, simply click on the applicable preference tab and click “Remove” to return the Product to the undesignated “Past Items” tab.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Any Products that you designate as “Recurring” items will be automatically added to your pre-populated cart during each Order period that the Product is available for purchase in addition to the items that were already added to your pre-populated cart based on your designated Plan Range. This means that the subtotal of your Order will increase above your Plan Range to account for the addition of these “Recurring” items. <span class="font-grotesk-bold">By adding Products to your “Recurring” item list, you are consenting to the addition of these “Recurring” items to your cart and the corresponding increase to your Order price above your Plan Range.</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Any Products that you designate as “Liked” items will be prioritized for adding to your pre-populated cart when they are available. However, “Liked” items will only be included in your pre-populated cart if their addition does not cause your Order subtotal to exceed the applicable dollar value for your Plan Range. “Liked” items will not increase your Order subtotal above your Plan Range. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Any Products that you designated as “Never” items will no longer be added to your pre-populated cart for your Grocery Subscription. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Please note that all Food Preferences are designated only for that specific Product, and similar Product types (for example, small bag of apples vs. a large bag of apples) that have not been specifically designated within a preference category will not also be subject to your designated Food Preferences. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">f. Cold-Pack Orders.</span> We require that certain of our Products be shipped to you in specialized packaging designed to keep items refrigerator-cold in transit (a “Cold Pack”), and we designate these Products during your shopping experience as requiring a Cold Pack (“Cold-Pack Products”). </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">For certain customers, we require a separate thirty dollar ($30) minimum of Cold-Pack Products within any Order in order to receive a Cold Pack. If you place Cold-Pack Products in your cart but do not reach this thirty dollar ($30) Cold Pack minimum, the Cold-Pack Products in your cart will not be included within your Order and you will not be charged for them.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Certain other customers may be permitted to purchase less than thirty dollars ($30) in Cold Pack Products for an additional fee on your Order in the amount stated in your shopping cart (“Cold-Pack Fee”). For these customers, the Cold-Pack Fee will automatically be waived if you add a subtotal of at least thirty dollar ($30) of Cold-Pack Products to your Order. If you are enrolled in this program, it will be described to you on the Cold Pack aisle during your shopping window and your Cold-Pack Fee will be reflected in your cart during your shopping window, including if you have added a qualifying subtotal of Cold-Pack Products for the Cold-Pack Fee to be waived.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Finally, some customers will be offered the ability to purchase Cold-Pack Products without a Cold-Pack Fee and no minimum subtotal. If you are enrolled in this program, you will be notified that it applies to you and you will not see a Cold-Pack Fee listed in your cart during your shopping window.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">g. Donating Your Skipped Box.</span> Instead of skipping a box, you can instead choose to donate the value of your box to a non-profit organization with a mission to save food from waste or loss, alleviate hunger, improve health outcomes through nutrition, and/or build a more sustainable food system through the “Delivery Schedule” section of your Account Home page. If you select this option, you will be charged for the amount shown on that page and Misfits Market will donate the amount of your donation to a non-profit organization we select on your behalf. Electing to donate your box is not considered a tax-deductible charitable contribution. Box donations are not refundable.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">h. Wine and Alcohol Orders.</span> Misfits Market may market alcoholic beverage Products (“Alcoholic Beverages”) on the Website. Purchases of Alcoholic Beverages may be subject to certain minimum purchase quantities as described on the Website, and an additional service fee may be charged with any Order containing Alcoholic Beverages as indicated when adding Alcoholic Beverages to your cart. Purchases of Alcoholic Beverages do not count towards your applicable Order Minimum.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">With respect to any Order requests for Alcoholic Beverages placed through the Website, Misfits Market serves only as a third-party marketer. Misfits Market is not, nor does it represent or warrant that it is, a licensed producer, distributor, or retailer of Alcoholic Beverages. All Order requests for Alcoholic Beverages are made to, accepted by, processed by, and fulfilled by a third-party licensed entity of such Alcoholic Beverages (the “Licensed Entity”). The Alcoholic Beverage portion of any Order request is subject to review by such Licensed Entity and may be rejected upon further review in its sole discretion. The name of the specific Licensed Entity for each Alcoholic Beverage will be provided within the production description on the Website for that Alcoholic Beverage.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Shipments of Alcoholic Beverages are delivered by UPS®, FedEx®, or other private courier separately from other Products sold on the Website. Shipments of Alcoholic Beverages may be delivered on a different day or time from packages containing other Products. Shipments of Alcoholic Beverages may also be delayed by the Licensed Entity, in its sole discretion, due to weather conditions, such as excessive heat. Alcoholic Beverages cannot be shipped to the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Mississippi, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Utah. Packages refused or returned to the Licensed Entity as undeliverable may be subject to a re-stocking fee and/or retention of any applicable alcohol service fee.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">BY PLACING ANY ORDER FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, YOU REPRESENT, WARRANT, AND CERTIFY THAT YOU AND THE RECIPIENT (IF APPLICABLE) OF ANY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ARE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE. THE SIGNATURE OF AN ADULT AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE IS REQUIRED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY OF ANY PACKAGE CONTAINING AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE. IF AN ADULT AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE WITH A VALIDLY ISSUED GOVERNMENT IDENTIFICATION IS NOT PRESENT AT THE DELIVERY ADDRESS DURING BUSINESS HOURS, THE DELIVERY CARRIER WILL NOT DELIVER ANY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. PRODUCTS CAN BE SHIPPED TO A PLACE OF BUSINESS OR RESIDENCE. WE CANNOT SHIP TO P.O. BOX OR APO BOXES.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Misfits Market and/or the Licensed Entity may restrict the application of any Promotions, Credits, or other discount offers to any Order requests for Alcoholic Beverages placed on the Website. Unless otherwise specified on the Website, any Promotions, Credits, or other discount offers applicable to Alcoholic Beverages are applied to a portion of the purchase price of each Alcoholic Beverage, shipping, and the alcohol service fee. If an Alcoholic Beverage becomes unavailable from the applicable Licensed Entity, the Licensed Entity reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, to replace the Alcoholic Beverage with an equivalent or similar Alcoholic Beverage or refund you for the item.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If any communication from this web site is not in conformity with any jurisdiction rules and regulations governing solicitation, advertising, shipping and/or transacting business for the sale of Alcoholic Beverages in such jurisdiction, then such communication and any offers made herein in connection therewith, shall be void to the extent prohibited by law.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If your Order of Alcoholic Beverages is damaged or incorrect, you must reach out to Misfits Market within fourteen (14) days of your receipt of your Order and we will handle your issue in accordance with the “Refunds and credits” section below.

The Offer will include important details and terms, such as the applicable Membership Benefits, the cost of the Imperfect+ membership (the “Membership Rate”), the applicable subscription term, and your billing interval (“Billing Cycle”). Please refer to your Offer for details before purchasing the Imperfect+ membership. By purchasing an Imperfect+ membership, you agree to these Terms, as well as the specific terms of the Offer. If you do not agree to these Terms or the terms of your Offer, do not purchase an Imperfect+ membership.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">b. Continuous Subscription; Duration and Frequency of Charges.</span> When you purchase an Imperfect+ membership, you will be charged the Membership Rate (plus any applicable taxes) for your first Billing Cycle on the date of purchase, or, if your Offer includes a free trial, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day your free trial ends, in each case which activates your Imperfect+ membership for the term set forth in your Offer. Unless you notify us in accordance with Section 6(c) below (Canceling your Imperfect+ Membership) that you want to cancel, you understand that your Imperfect+ membership will continue and your default payment method will automatically be charged at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day your current Billing Cycle ends until you cancel. UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR IMPERFECT+ MEMBERSHIP, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE MEMBERSHIP RATE PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES (WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), USING YOUR DEFAULT PAYMENT METHOD OR ANY OTHER ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD AVAILABLE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Please note that in certain circumstances, your billing date may change (for example, if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method for the Imperfect+ membership fee on a given day). </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">c. Canceling your Imperfect+ Membership.</span> You may cancel your Imperfect+ membership on our Website prior to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day your current Billing Cycle ends to avoid further charges.

If you cancel your Imperfect+ membership within the first seven (7) calendar days (or fourteen (14) calendar days if your Orders are delivered on a biweekly cadence) of your subscription period and have not placed any Orders using your Imperfect+ membership, Misfits Market may, in its sole discretion, refund your Membership Rate. If we issue a refund, credit, or discount, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you cancel your Imperfect+ membership at any other time during a Billing Cycle, you will not receive a refund, but you will still have access to your Membership Benefits until the end of your then-current subscription term. However, if you have a free trial and you cancel your Imperfect+ Membership, then your access to your Membership Benefits will end upon cancellation (unless you cancel during an open shopping window, in which case your Membership Benefits will end once the Order placed during such shopping window is fulfilled).</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">d. Trial and Promotional Subscriptions. </span>Misfits Market may offer certain users a free trial or other promotional subscriptions to an Imperfect+ membership. Such trial or promotional subscriptions are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in your Offer. Only one trial or promotional subscription is available per household. Free trial or promotional subscription eligibility is determined by Misfits Market in its sole discretion. Subject to applicable laws, we reserve the right to cancel, revoke, or terminate your free trial or promotional offer for any reason, including in the event that we determine that you are not eligible or to prevent free trial abuse or fraud. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining a free trial or promotional subscription with any other offers. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">We may require you to provide your payment details to start the free trial or promotional subscription. BY PROVIDING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS, YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR IMPERFECT+ MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT INTO A PAID, AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP RATE STATED IN YOUR OFFER PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE CHARGED FOR ANOTHER BILLING CYCLE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CANCELLATION METHOD DESCRIBED IN SECTION 6(C) ABOVE.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you purchase an Imperfect+ membership with a promotional code or discount, each time your Imperfect+ membership renews, you will be charged the full Membership Rate rather than the promotional amount unless expressly stated otherwise. Promotional Offers cannot be combined unless expressly permitted by Misfits Market.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">e. Updates and Changes to Membership Benefits and Imperfect+ Membership. </span>Please note that the Membership Benefits that are available to you are subject to change and may vary based on your delivery location and other factors. For example, if your Membership Benefits include free or discounted shipping, such shipping benefit may vary based on the delivery method utilized for Orders in your delivery location. Such shipping benefit will be described to you in your Offer but may be subsequently updated upon notice to you if you change your delivery location or if Misfits Market changes the delivery method utilized for your delivery location. Misfits Market makes no promise of the continued availability of any Membership Benefit, even if it is displayed to you on the Website or in your Offer. By purchasing an Imperfect+ membership,<span class="font-grotesk-bold"> you acknowledge and agree that Misfits Market expressly reserves the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel some or all of the Membership Benefits, at any time and in its sole and absolute discretion, without compensation to you.</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Misfits Market reserves the right to change the Membership Rate or alter the features associated with an Imperfect+ membership at any time in its sole discretion. If Misfits Market changes your Membership Rate, such fee change will not apply to current Imperfect+ members until such time as their current subscription term expires and their memberships are renewed for another term. We will provide you with notice of any such change to your Membership Rate, and if you do not wish to continue your Imperfect+ membership with the new Membership Rate, you can cancel your Imperfect+ membership in accordance with the instructions in Section 6(c) above. Misfits Market may also make changes with respect to current Imperfect+ memberships, in which case Misfits Market will provide you with notice of the changes and when they will take effect. If you do not consent to the changes to your Imperfect+ membership, you may cancel as described in Section 6(c) above. Your continued use of the Services after a fee or feature change becomes effective will constitute your acceptance of the change, and any updated terms and conditions will apply for the remaining Billing Cycle and all renewals going forward. </p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Misfits Market reserves the right to stop offering the Imperfect+ membership at any time in its sole discretion.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">f. Cancellation by Misfits Market; No Transfer or Assignment. </span>Misfits Market may terminate, suspend, refuse or cancel your Imperfect+ membership at any time in its sole discretion without notice, including in the event we are unable to collect payment from you. If Misfits Market cancels your Imperfect+ membership, you will receive a pro-rata refund of your Membership Rate based on the amount of time remaining in your Billing Cycle, unless such termination related to conduct that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms, any applicable law, or involves fraud or misuse of the Imperfect+ membership or the Services. If your Imperfect+ membership is ever terminated for any reason, you will not be eligible for a free trial or promotional subscription on any subsequent Imperfect+ membership unless otherwise permitted by Misfits Market in its sole discretion.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Your Imperfect+ membership cannot be transferred or assigned.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">7.

You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to Promotions, Credits, the particular number and assortment of Products you add to or retain within your cart in each Order, your Imperfect+ membership, if applicable, and changes in applicable taxes, shipping charges, or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third party-payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice. The shipment of Products to you after our delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your account.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">b.

You will be charged in full for the actual total of your Order when we pack your Order, at which point we will authorize the release of any excess amounts held. Please be aware that your payment method’s rules will apply to your credit card or payment account being credited for any hold amounts released and may not be immediately released by your card issuer.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">c. Default</span>. If your default payment is declined for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Misfits Market to charge any other payment method available in your account. If no other payment method is available in your account, Misfits Market may prompt you for a new payment method, or your payment method provider may provide us with updated payment details. If Misfits Market is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for fees due, we reserve the right to restrict, suspend access to, or terminate your account and cancel your Order. Misfits Market is not responsible for any fees charged by your bank including, but not limited to, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">d.

Promotions are subject to eligibility criteria and additional terms and conditions (“Promotional Terms”), which will be provided to you at the time you redeem the Promotion or in other communications made available to you. We encourage you read all Promotional Terms carefully. In order to use a Promotion, you will be required to create an account with Misfits Market and may be required to take other actions as described in the Promotional Terms, such as entering a promotional code on the “Promos &amp; Credits” section of your Account Home page, and your use of any Promotion will be deemed to confirm your agreement to these Terms of Service and any Promotional Terms applicable to the Promotion. Certain Promotional Terms may include a “claim by” date, which identifies the date by which the Promotion must be claimed and applied to your account through the method described in the Promotional Terms, and a “use by” date, which identifies the final date on which your shopping window can close to remain eligible to use the Promotion. Following the expiration or exhaustion of your Promotion, you agree and acknowledge that you will be billed at the standard prices for your future Orders pursuant to these Terms of Service.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Misfits Market may determine your eligibility for any Promotion in our sole discretion, and we may use information such as your device ID, method of payment, purchase history, or contact information to determine your eligibility for a Promotion.

Product Availability.</span> A reference to a Product on the Website does not imply or guarantee that it is or will be available at the time of your shopping window or during fulfillment of your Order.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">We attempt to display images of the Products on the Website as accurately as possible. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of such materials and information. The appearance, color, size, condition and other characteristics of each Product will vary from product to product.

Refunds and Credits.</span> If you discover a quality issue regarding your Order, you must reach out to Misfits Market within seven (7) days of your receipt of your Order.

We may require the return or photographic documentation of any Product that you are dissatisfied with before we provide you with a refund, replacement, or Credit, as applicable, at our election.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Credits are subject to any additional terms and conditions described at the time such Credit is provided or as otherwise described under the “Promos &amp; Credits” section of your Account Home page, including any expiration dates. Credits will typically be automatically applied to your account, but certain Credits may require additional action on your part (for example, entering a coupon code) in order to be applied to future purchases, which will be communicated to you at the time of issuance. Once applied to your account, Credits will automatically be applied to the purchase of your next Order(s) until exhausted or expired. A maximum of $250 in Credits may be applied to any single Order. Credits will only be applied to Orders that are fulfilled and not to donated or skipped orders. Credits cannot be applied to purchases of Alcoholic Beverages or gift cards, or to pay for your Imperfect+ Membership Rate, if applicable.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Credits are promotional in nature, are not transferable, and are not redeemable for cash or other property. Credits only remain available if you maintain a valid account with Misfits Market. That means that if you cancel your account, any outstanding Credits associated with your cancelled account will immediately expire. You may only redeem Credits after they are applied to your account. If for some reason you believe there is a discrepancy regarding your Credit balance, please click <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact" rel="noopener">here</a> to contact us. All decisions regarding your Credit balance will be determined in our sole discretion and are final.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you purchase a Product as part of a “buy one get one” Promotion, the discount is based on the lowest priced Product, then applied to each Product proportionately. If you receive a refund or Credit for any Product purchased as part of a “buy one get one” Promotion, your refund or Credit will be the discounted amount of that Product. For example, if your first qualifying Product purchased pursuant to a “buy one get one 50% off” Promotion is $3 and your second qualifying Product is $2, the $3 Product will be discounted by $.60 and the $2 Product will be discounted by $.40, for a total discount of $1. If a refund or Credit of either Product is granted, the refund or Credit amount will be the original price reduced by its prorated discount.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">If you receive a refund or Credit for any Product purchased as part of a discount Promotion, your refund or Credit will be the discounted amount of that Product. For example, if the Product is $4 and it qualified for a 20% discount, the refund or Credit amount would be $3.20.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">All Orders of Alcoholic Beverages, merchandise, and other non-food items are non-refundable.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">9.

Gift Cards</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Misfits Market offers gift cards in any denomination between $10 and $250. Upon purchase of a gift card, the purchaser will receive an email confirmation containing a unique gift card code that they can forward to the intended recipient. If the recipient is an existing Misfits Market customer, they can add the gift card amount to their Misfits Market credit balance. If the recipient is a new customer, they will need to set up a Misfits Market account and input their credit card number. If the recipient does not live in Misfits Market&#x27;s delivery area at the time of purchase, the recipient can keep the gift card to use in the future, or the purchaser may contact <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact" rel="noopener">Customer Care</a> to request that the gift card be voided, in which event the amount paid for the gift card will be added as a credit on the purchaser&#x27;s Misfits Market account.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">The gift card balance will be added to the recipient&#x27;s Misfits Market credit balance, and purchases made will be deducted from that balance. The unused portion of any gift card will remain in the recipient&#x27;s credit balance and can be used for future purchases. In the event that the total purchase amount exceeds the recipient&#x27;s total credit balance, the difference will be charged to the credit card on file. Gift cards do not expire and do not decrease in value over time.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Gift card purchases are non-refundable, and gift cards cannot be reloaded, resold, transferred for value, or redeemed for cash, except as required by law. Gift cards cannot be redeemed by the gift card purchaser for their own use. Misfits Market is not responsible for lost, stolen, or destroyed gift cards or use by someone other than the intended recipient or other misuse. Use of gift cards for unauthorized marketing, sweepstakes, or other promotional or commercial purposes is prohibited. Gift cards may not be combined with certain promotional offers, and cannot be used to purchase additional gift cards. Gift cards may not be used for the purchase of Alcoholic Beverages or to pay your Imperfect+ Membership Rate, if applicable. Misfits Market reserves the right to refuse gift card sales to anyone and limit how many gift cards a customer may purchase or redeem. Customers may not purchase gift cards exceeding $1,000 total in any calendar month. If Misfits Market suspects that a gift card is obtained or used in violation of these terms and conditions or of any applicable law or regulation, Misfits Market reserves the right to void outstanding gift cards or any component of the customer’s account balance, close the account, and bill alternative forms of payment. Misfits Market may change the terms and conditions pertaining to the sale and redemption of gift cards at any time in its sole discretion.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">By purchasing or using a Misfits Market gift card, you agree to be bound by this Section 10 and these Terms.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">12.

Some special promotional offers, benefits, and communications may also be based on the volume or type of purchases.</li></ul><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Dollar amounts for purchase calculations are based on the Order’s subtotal, meaning that it excludes any tax or shipping fees applicable to the Order. Points based on purchases may not be earned in fractional amounts. The purchase amount of any subtotal will automatically be rounded down to the nearest one U.S. Dollar ($1) when calculating the number of Points awarded for any Order. Qualifying purchases include grocery items sold through the Misfits Market website and mobile application, but expressly exclude any alcoholic beverages (including wine) or gift cards. Donated boxes are eligible to earn Points on the amount of your donation at the rate consistent with your order plan.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">You will remain eligible to earn points if you use more than one eligible payment method to purchase a single Order. For example, if you purchase an Order with a subtotal $35.50 using $5 in Credits and paying the remaining $30.50 with your credit card on file, you will earn 35 Points on the purchase.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">Points will not be deducted from our Points balance if a single Product or your full Order is refunded due to an issue with the Product or Order. However, if your Order is cancelled for any reason, the applicable Points from that Order will be deducted from your Points balance.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">You can see your current Points balance on the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/account/misfits-perks" rel="noopener">Misfits Perks</a> section of your Account Home page. It may take twenty-four (24) hours or more for the Point(s) to show in your account. Misfits Market reserves the right to update, modify, or revoke any of the methods of earning Points as described above at any time in its sole discretion and without advanced notice to you.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">e. Points Expiration.</span> Unless otherwise noted, Points are automatically added to your account within twenty-four (24) hours of your qualifying purchase or activity and will automatically expire in any of the following scenarios:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-20"><li>If you <span class="font-grotesk-bold">do not place an Order with Misfits Market within sixty (60) days of your most recent Order</span>, as measured from the date your most recent Order was charged until the date your next Order is charged, <span class="font-grotesk-bold">your full Points balance will expire and be automatically forfeited without compensation</span>. For example, if you place an Order that is charged on July 1, 2022, and you do not place another Order that is charged on or before August 30, 2022, your Points balance will expire.</li><li>If you <span class="font-grotesk-bold">do not redeem Points for a Perk within three-hundred sixty-five (365) days of the date the Points were first earned, those Points will expire and be automatically forfeited without compensation</span>. The oldest accrued Points will be used first for Perk redemptions. For example, if you place an Order that is charged on July 1, 2022, and do not redeem the applicable Points earned from that Order for any Perk applicable to an Order that is charged on or before June 30, 2023, the applicable Points earned from the Order charged on July 1, 2022 will expire.</li><li>If your account is <span class="font-grotesk-bold">cancelled by you or by us for any reason, your full Points balance will expire and be automatically forfeited without compensation</span>.</li></ul><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">f. Redeeming Points for Perks.</span> Points may be redeemed for complimentary Perks that apply to your upcoming Order.

If you skip or otherwise do not place an Order to which a Perk was applied, your Perk will not be completed and any Points applied to that Perk will be returned to your Points balance for use on a future Order. You may also select the “Unredeem” button on the “Misfits Perks” section of your Account Home page at any time during your shopping window to opt out of redeeming a particular Perk.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">You may apply multiple Perks to any Order (up to a maximum of 1,000 Points redeemed per Order) so long as you have a sufficient number of Points to redeem those Perks, except that any dollar-value discount Perks (if offered) will be limited to a maximum of one (1) per Order.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">g.

Governing Law</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md">No matter where you&#x27;re located, the laws of the State of New York will govern the Terms and the relationship between you and Misfits Market as if you signed or otherwise agreed to the Terms in New York, without regard to New York&#x27;s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of the Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded and/or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under the Terms, then the parties agree to submit to the federal or state courts in New York County, New York for exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of litigating any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of the Terms.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">21. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</span></p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">a. Generally</span>. You and Misfits Market agree that every dispute arising out of or in connection with the Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Terms or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MISFITS MARKET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">b. Exceptions</span>. Despite the provisions of Section 21(a) nothing in the Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">c. Arbitrator</span>. Any arbitration between you and Misfits Market will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Misfits Market. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">d. Notice; Process</span>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Misfits Market&#x27;s address for Notice is: Misfits Market, Inc., c/o Imperfect Foods, Inc., 16800 SE Evelyn St., Suite 140 Clackamas, OR 97015 , Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Misfits Market may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Misfits Market must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, we will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Misfits Market in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">e. Fees</span>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York County, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Misfits Market for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&#x27;s ruling on the merits.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">f. No Class Actions</span>. YOU AND MISFITS MARKET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Misfits Market agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">g. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</span>. If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice to our address for Notice within 30 days of the change, in which case your account with Misfits Market will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">h. Cause of Action</span>. You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the products must be commenced by you within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise such cause of action is permanently barred.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">i. Enforceability</span>. If Section 21(f) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 21 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p><p class="mt-20 mb-10 text-body-md"><span class="font-grotesk-bold">22.

Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York County, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Misfits Market for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
