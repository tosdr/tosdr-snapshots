No on-chain rewards equal no transaction fees and mean the fully distributed supply, completed in 2017, is ideal for the network design. Instead, participants on the nano network are driven by external incentives, such as helping maintain an instant payment network they can use without fees.","faq/category-2/question-1/paragraph-3":"This combination of design decisions - providing lightweight consensus and removing on-chain incentives - avoids other networks' competitive, energy-intensive activities. The end result is a fast and energy-efficient nano network.","faq/category-2/question-2":"How is the nano network throttled?","faq/category-2/question-2/paragraph-1":"There are two requirements used to throttle the nano network. First, a lightweight Proof-of-Work value is required for every transaction. This establishes a minimum amount of computational resources needed for a transaction to be added to the ledger.","faq/category-2/question-2/paragraph-2":"Before a transaction is confirmed, it must have an election started for it and be voted on by the network. This is where the second throttle is put in place to limit how often elections are started on an account. The algorithm for managing this considers network capacity, voting activity, balance on accounts, the status of confirmation of previous blocks on the account and other details to the scheduled elections.","faq/category-2/question-2/paragraph-3":"The result is a better quality of service for lower-use and higher-balance accounts when network usage is near capacity.","faq/category-2/question-3":"Why does the network require very little energy?","faq/category-2/question-3/paragraph-1":"There are three main reasons nano is fast and energy-efficient compared to other decentralised currencies: the distribution method, the lack of transaction fees, and the ledger's design and consensus mechanism for securing transactions.","faq/category-2/question-3/paragraph-2":"Due to the single blockchain design of other decentralised currencies, they must rely on a process called \u003Cem\u003Emining\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to provide security for their chain. Mining is a competitive process that incentivises massive computational resources and energy usage to win the rewards of newly created supply or transaction fees.","faq/category-2/question-3/paragraph-3":"This design requires slow payment times and causes a constant feedback loop, increasing resource usage needed to win the rewards. Over time the energy wasted can surpass that of entire countries, and without this resource usage, the system becomes insecure.","faq/category-2/question-3/paragraph-4":"By providing a novel ledger design, called the block-lattice, nano avoids the bottleneck of the single blockchain design. Meaning competitive activities like mining are not required to build the ledger.","faq/category-3":"Running Nodes","faq/category-3/question-1":"Who can run a representative node, and what are the requirements to be a node operator?","faq/category-3/question-1/paragraph-1":"Running a node is a crucial way to help decentralise the network and provide a network access point for systems built on top of nano. Anyone can set up a representative and gain voting weight by delegating their nano to the representative. They can also vote on behalf of others who entrust them as their representative.","faq/category-3/question-1/paragraph-2":"Follow recommended specifications of the nodes in our guide on \u003Ca href='https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.nano.org\u002Frunning-a-node\u002Foverview\u002F' target='_blank' rel='noopener'\u003ERunning a Node\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","faq/category-3/question-2":"How can I choose my representative?","faq/category-3/question-2/paragraph-1":"Choosing a representative with good uptime, that is also a unique entity (to prevent Sybil attacks) helps maintain high nano network security.","faq/category-3/question-2/paragraph-2":"You can change your representative on every good nano wallet. Go to the app or account settings and look for the representative option.
