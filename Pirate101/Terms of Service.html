BINDING ARBITRATION; CHOICE OF LAW; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
<br><br>
These Terms of Use shall be governed in all respects by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.
<br><br>
Any dispute that arises out of results from these Terms of Use, the Site or the Services which cannot be promptly resolved by the parties through informal negotiations shall be resolved through binding arbitration as set forth herein.  The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  The parties shall mutually agree upon a single arbitrator.  In the event the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the arbitrator within thirty (30) days of one party initiating the arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected by AAA.  The place of arbitration shall be Dallas, Texas, USA unless the parties agree (or the arbitrator determines) that the arbitration may be conducted by phone, online, through the exchange of written submissions or some combination of the foregoing.  The language of the arbitration shall be English and the arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Texas, USA.  The parties will be entitled to engage in discovery in accordance with the AAA rules.  It is the parties’ intent that the discovery proceedings be conducted in a cost-efficient manner and to resolve the arbitration within six (6) months of initiation.  Each party will bear its own expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, in connection with resolution of any dispute; provided that each party shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of engaging the arbitrator unless the arbitrator determines that the Company shall pay one hundred percent of the arbitrator fees and costs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to seeking arbitration, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to a breach (or attempted breach) of these Terms of Use with respect to intellectual property or confidentiality.
<br><bR>
<i>PLEASE NOTE:  The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding.  The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.   By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you are subject to binding arbitration and are waiving your right to sue in court and have a jury trial, as well as waiving the option to participate in a “class action” with respect to the Site or services hereunder.</i>
