<span
>Scope and Purpose of the Processing of Personal Data and
the Legal Bases for Processing
</span>
</h1>
<p>
The scope and purposes of the processing of your personal data
will depend on which of our games and other services you use
from us, i.e., not every one of our games and other services
includes all of the personal data processing practices described
herein. In the following, we would like to give you an overview
of the personal data that we process in connection with all of
our services. Furthermore, we have listed the different
categories of data and examples of personal data that can be
processed when using the corresponding service.
</p>
<p>
Personal data is all information about you and your factual and
personal circumstances, for example name, address or age. Data
that cannot be assigned to a specific natural person is not
personal data. For example, this can be statistical data that
describes a group.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of which of our games and other services you use, we
will treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance
with the statutory data protection regulations. We will not
share it with third parties without your consent, unless
permitted by law (e.g., because it is necessary to perform the
contract).
</p>
<p>
In the following you can also read on which legal basis the
respective processing of the listed data is based.
</p>
<p>
The main legal bases in scope are regulated in Art. 6 para. 1
sentence 1 GDPR. These are, as far as relevant for us, the
following cases:
</p>
<p>
Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR: Data processing is based
on a consent that you have granted us.
</p>
<p>
Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR: The data processing is
necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
party or is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual
measures taken at your request.
</p>
<p>
Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit c) GDPR: Data processing is
necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we
are subject.
</p>
<p>
Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR: The data processing is
necessary to protect our legitimate interests or those of a
third party, unless your interests or fundamental rights and
freedoms requiring the protection of personal data, outweigh
these.

regularly, so updates are provided and must be installed. As
part of this, personal data is processed so that we can track
whether the download (and thus our offered game or other

progress. Among other things, we keep records of game licenses,
progress, history, statistics, in-game purchases and
interactions with other users.

other hand, we must ensure that the user is compliant with our
Terms of Use, the rules of the game and applicable law (e.g.,
data protection and criminal regulations) in order to guarantee
a flawless gaming experience. In particular, the maximum
permitted user accounts per person according to our Terms of Use
(“multi-accounting”) must not be exceeded, and the use of fraud
software which is used to gain in-game advantages or for attacks
on technical systems must be prevented. For this purpose, we use
various protection programs that also process personal data.

portraits, gold, boosters), other unlocks, character names,
social exchanges, connected games, chat logs, progress, game
history, tasks in progress, game statistics, guild information,
in-game messages, friend lists, inventory items (equipment,
skills, etc.), screenshots, technical user data such as browser

<h3 id="728-push-messages">7.2.8. <span>Push messages</span></h3>
<p>
Some of the games and other services allow you to stay up to
date using push messages. They inform you about important events
or remind you of certain events. The device token allows us to
identify the phone based on the app-device combination issued by
the providers of push notification gateways. This enables
gateway providers to forward messages and ensure that the
notification is only sent to devices that have the unique
app-device combination.
</p>
<p>
Examples of processed data: Content of the sent message, date of
the sent message, user account, device tokens.
</p>

<h2 id="77-marketing-and-newsletters">
7.7. <span>Marketing and newsletters</span>
</h2>
<p>
We can inform you by newsletter about similar goods and services
according to Sec. 7 para. 3 UWG (German Unfair Competition Act),
for example about other games from us. You can unsubscribe from
receiving further newsletters at any time free of charge using
the link contained in the newsletter (“Unsubscribe button”). In
addition, we inform you by newsletter about all offers, services
and other activities by us or the other companies in the gamigo
group and about all other offers, services and other activities
by third parties in connection with the offers, services and
other activities of one or more companies in the gamigo group
(so-called gamigo group newsletter) if you have previously
consented to this newsletter being sent to you. You can also
unsubscribe from this newsletter free of charge at any time
using the unsubscribe button contained in the newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Newsletters are sent at our request by our service provider.
Your e-mail address, which receives our newsletter, and other
personal data are temporarily stored on the service provider’s
servers. This information is used to send and evaluate the
newsletter. For this purpose, so-called tracking pixels are
used, i.e. in our newsletter there is a non-visible image file
which transmits technical information to the service provider
when the newsletter is opened (e.g. whether the newsletter has
been opened). Your data will not be used by the service provider
independently to send the newsletter.
</p>
<p>
We also place banner ads on websites, i.e., we provide our
partners with a graphic that they can integrate on their
website. The banner contains a hyperlink so that the user can
reach one of our websites. In order to enable a statistical
evaluation, an ID is generated using a pixel-code to determine
how users became aware of our products and, if applicable,
whether they have completed a payment transaction.
</p>
<p>
Examples of processed data: IP addresses, the language used,
hardware, how the newsletter was handled, i.e., when it was
read, and which links were clicked on.
</p>
<p>
The described processing of personal data, i.e., the sending of
newsletters, has as its basis Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f)
GDPR in conjunction with Sec. 7 para. 3 UWG for the advertising
of our own similar goods and services, on the other hand, Art. 6
para. 1 p.1 lit. a) GDPR in connection with Sec. 7 para. 2 no. 3
UWG if you have consented to the gamigo group newsletter being
sent to you. We base the use of the pixel-code on Art. 6 Para. 1
S.1. lit. f) GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in
customizing our information according to the recipient.

para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.
</p>
<h2 id="79-processing-for-legal-reasons">
7.9. <span>Processing for legal reasons</span>
</h2>
<p>
We pass on personal data insofar as we are legally obliged to do
so. This can happen, for example, as a result of a court or
public prosecutor’s order. In doing so, strict attention is paid
to ensuring that all statutory requirements are met before
passing on the data. In general, only certain data is requested
(e.g., technical user data), but in principle the obligation to
pass on data may apply to all data collected. Before each
transfer of personal data, we critically check whether we are
obliged to do so.
</p>
<p>
We also pass on personal data in the context of legal
proceedings (e.g., to external lawyers) if this is necessary to
assert our rights (e.g., to protect intellectual property
rights).
</p>
<p>
Examples of processed data: Contact details, user account
information.
</p>
<p>
We will only process personal data for legal reasons as
described above if it is compliant with the applicable law. The
legal basis is by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1. lit. c) GDPR for
the fulfillment of a legal obligation or under Art. 6 para. 1
sentence 1. lit. f) GDPR because we have a legitimate interest
in ensuring that our rights are safeguarded or enforced.
</p>
<h1 id="8-storage-duration-and-deletion-of-the-collected-data">
8.
<span>Storage Duration and Deletion of the Collected Data</span>
</h1>
<p>
We store personal data only as long as there is a concrete
purpose for this. The duration of the storage depends on the
purpose of the processing, the requirements of the processing,
as well as on your and our interests and rights and, if
applicable, the interests and rights of third parties. We always
store personal data as briefly as possible (principle of data
economy data/minimization), but at the same time we observe the
statutory requirements which stipulate a minimum retention
period (e.g., in commercial and tax law of up to 10 years, Sec.
257 para. 4 of the German Commercial Code, Sec. 147 para. 3 of
the German Fiscal Code).
</p>
<p>
In any case, the following shall apply: If the purpose of
processing has ceased to exist or if data is no longer required
to achieve this purpose and there are no further statutory
storage obligations to the contrary, we delete the relevant data
(e.g., we delete support tickets at the latest 9 months after we
have processed your request).
</p>
<h1 id="9-recipient-of-personal-data">
9. <span>Recipient of Personal Data</span>
</h1>
<p>
To achieve the processing purposes described above, we pass on
personal data to various categories of recipients. The concrete
passing on of personal data about you depends largely on which

We share personal data with the following categories of service
providers as processors: service providers in the context of
fraud and manipulation prevention, , to service providers to
conduct surveys, to service providers for analysis services, to
payment service providers, to service providers for sending
newsletter, to service providers for advertising services, data
centers, as well as to subsidiaries and affiliated companies
within the meaning of Sec. 15 AktG (German Stock Corporation
Act). The transfer of the personal data to the respective
recipient as processor is lawful under Art. 28 GDPR.
</p>
<p>
We pass on personal data to the following categories of service
providers as independent controllers: Lawyers, authorities, the
police, payment service providers, and providers of “social

<p>
Google Analytics is a widely used web analytics
service from Google Ireland Ltd. in Dublin. The methods provided
by Google Analytics enable a cross-device analysis of

while using the website is usually transferred to a Google
server in the United States of America and also stored there.
Google uses the collected information to analyze the use of
websites on our behalf, to create reports and to provide
services for the purposes of market research and website
optimization. The anonymous IP address automatically transmitted
to Google is not combined with other Google data and is only
used by us for statistical analysis. The processing of the data
by Google can be prevented by a suitable browser add-on. If you
use a mobile device, it is possible to deactivate Google
Analytics using the following link. This prevents activity data

</h3>
<p>
We use the remarketing feature of Google Ireland Ltd. in Dublin,
which allows us to target visitors to a website with
personalized and interest-based advertising as soon as they
visit another Google Display Network site. For this purpose,
Google uses cookies that perform an analysis of website usage,
which forms the basis for creating interest-based online
advertising. To carry out this process, Google places a short
file with an identification number on your end device, through
which website visits and anonymized data on the use of the
respective websites are recorded. To the extent that visitors
have agreed to have their web and app browsing histories linked
by Google to their Google Account, and information from their
Google Account is used to personalize ads displayed, Google will
use data from these logged-in users along with Google Analytics
data to create and define target audience lists for cross-device
remarketing. This allows visitors to the website to be addressed
with personalized, interest-based advertising across devices.
Subsequent visits to other sites on the Google Display Network
will display advertisements that most likely reflect the product
and information areas previously viewed by the site visitor. If
you do not wish to use Google’s remarketing function, you can
deactivate it by adjusting the corresponding settings at
<a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads"
