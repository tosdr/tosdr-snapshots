        Revised Date: August 1st, 2023
      </p>
      <p>
        Auto Accident Team and its affiliated companies (“we” or “us”) respect the privacy of all individuals.
        This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal
        Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of our website(s) on which this Privacy Policy
        is linked (collectively, “Sites”) and any transactions, interactions, or other engagements you might have
        with us (collectively, “Services”). For clarity, the term “Sites” does not include any sites owned or
        operated by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Sites or Services, you consent to the collection
        and use of your information by us as set out in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy forms a part of
        and is incorporated into our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Service</a>, and any capitalized terms used
        but not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings given to them in the Terms of
        Service. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE OR
        ACCESS THE SITE.
      </p>

          Privacy Policy Changes
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for
        any revisions or amendments. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, the revised policy
        will be posted on the Sites with the date of revision. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.
        You will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued use of our
        Sites or Services. If we determine that a change to this Privacy Policy will result in using your Personal
        Information acquired before the change being used in a materially new way, we will provide notice, such as
        by a posting on the Sites or an email to your last known email address, before using your Personal
        Information in the new way.

        <strong>
          Conflict Between this Policy and Laws and Regulations

      </p>
      <p>
        When federal, state, or local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal
        Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy
        apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations. Please be aware that the Sites and Services are
        subject to the laws of the United States of America and that your Personal Information will be processed in
        the United States and other jurisdictions. The Sites and Services are intended for use by individuals in the
        United States.

        We may collect information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being
        associated with you (“Personal Information”), including:

      </ul>
      <p>
        The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Usage Data and Sites Activity
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites (“Usage Data”).
        For example, each time you visit our Sites, we may automatically collect the type of web browser you use,
        the type of device you use, the type of your operating system, the name of your Internet Service Provider,
        the pages you view on our Sites, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, and the number
        of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. If this information
        is reasonably capable of being associated with you, we treat it as Personal Information under the category
        Internet and Network Information. If this information is not reasonably capable of being individually
        associated with you, we treat it as Usage Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Communication Recordings
        </strong>
      </p>

        We may record calls and retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications
        between you and us. By communicating with us, you explicitly consent to our recording and retention of
        communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          From You
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us (online or offline),
        use the Sites or Services, enter into a relationship with us, and at other times. You are not required
        to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information,
        you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Sites or Services or we may not be able to
        fulfill your requested interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Cookies and Other Automated Tools
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We and third parties use cookies (small text files placed on your computer to identify your computer and
        browser) and other automated tools such as pixels to track your interaction with our Sites and to improve
        the experience of our Sites and Services, such as saving your preferences from visit to visit to present
        you with a customized version of the Website. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
        You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However,
        certain features of our Sites may not work if you delete or disable cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the following types of cookies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Strictly Necessary:</i> These cookies are essential to operate the Sites and provide you with services you have requested.</li>
        <li>
          <i>Functional:</i> These cookies enable certain features or non-essential functionality on our Sites.
          For example, we might use these cookies to recognize you and remember your preferences or settings when
          you return to our Sites so we can provide you with a more personalized experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Advertising Cookies:</i> These cookies allow us and third parties to learn more about you, including
          your use of our Sites and other websites, and to advertise products or services that might interest you
          as further indicated below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Analytics Cookies:</i> These cookies help us and third parties understand how our Sites are working and
          who is visiting our Sites.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We and third parties also use tools that enable us to track certain aspects of a user’s visit to our Sites.
        This technology helps us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective, how
        consumers engage with our Sites, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from our Sites. The software
        typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear gifs.” Tracking
        pixels are pieces of executable code embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which
        pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics
        with unique identifiers embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether a user views a web
        page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a
        user’s session and Personal Information, if provided by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can opt-out of certain types of cookies and other tracking tools by clicking the cookie settings icon at
        the bottom of applicable Sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you arrive at our Sites by “clicking through” from another website, then certain information about you
        that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you searched that led you to our Sites, may be
        transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the Privacy Policy of any website from which you
        reached our Sites to determine what information the operator collects and how it uses such information.
        We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will use it in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Interest-Based Advertising
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Ad Networks”) to learn more
        about you and show you ads or other content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect
        and use information about your use of our Sites or Services as well as other websites and services. These
        companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We
        and/or Ad Networks may also append other data to the data collected by Ad Networks to create an interest
        profile of individual users. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Ad Network
        may collect from you except when the Ad Network acts as our service provider. Advertisements may be shown
        via our Sites or on third-party websites. If you do not want to receive interest-based advertising, please
        visit the <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer
          Choice Page.</a> The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or more interest-based advertising networks.
        Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you must set your opt-out preferences for each device
        and browser. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers
        <a href="https://youradchoices.com/">browser extensions</a> that help preserve the opt-out preferences
        you set on the DAA's Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising.
        You may still receive other types of online advertising.
      </p>

        our Sites. We may gather data directly from Partner websites, or our Partners may post data to our
        Sites or otherwise transfer data to us. This may occur via display ads, click listings, inquiry forms
        or telephonic transfers from our Partners. We also may receive data from advertisers, advertising agencies,

        for goods and services.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other
        “Do Not Track” mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser Do Not Track signals that provide
        a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third
        party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which
        case we will post a revised Privacy Policy on the Sites.
      </p>

        <strong>
          DATA RETENTION
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We retain your Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you. We also retain your
        Personal Information for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an
        ongoing business need to retain it. This includes but is not limited to retention to comply with our legal,
        regulatory, tax, and/or accounting obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          OTHER TRANSFERS
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under
        common control with us. If we are merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of any of
        our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection therewith.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply
        with the law. We may disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, and any other information about you to
        government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our sole discretion, we believe it is
        necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands,
        and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third
        party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your Personal Information.
        While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the Personal Information you provide to us, please be aware
        that despite our efforts no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission
        can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is
        vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete
        security if you provide Personal Information to us, and we encourage you to exercise discretion regarding
        the Personal Information you choose to disclose.
