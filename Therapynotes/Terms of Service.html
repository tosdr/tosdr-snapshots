<ol class="ToS__AlphaList">
<li>
<h3>About The Services</h3>
<p>
The Services include User scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, provision of patient
records, telehealth, e-prescribing (covered under a separate Terms of Usage),
outcome measures, and billing information, and related features that can be used by
Users and Providers. We are not responsible for content, information, guidance, or
other materials that are provided to you through the Services by Providers,
including responses to your questions or healthcare advice by medical professionals.
Such information is provided to Users from a Provider pursuant to a separate
doctor-patient or other relationship directly between those parties.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>
This Agreement may be revised or updated by TherapyNotes from time to time in its
sole discretion, and the most recent effective date is listed at the top under “Last
Updated”. Where appropriate, TherapyNotes will provide notice to you as provided
below. By continuing to access or use the Services after the effective date of any
such change, you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>USE OF THE SERVICES AND YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
<ol class="ToS__AlphaList">
<li>
<h3>Permitted Users</h3>
<p>
The Site is offered and available only (1) to users who are 18 years of age or older
(or the legal age of majority where you reside if that jurisdiction has an older age
of majority) and, (2) who reside in the United States or its territories. By using
the Services or registering an Account, you represent that you are at least 18 years
of age, or the legal age of majority where you reside if that jurisdiction has an
older age of majority, you have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement,
and that you reside in the United States or its territories. If you are the parent,
legal guardian, or duly authorized personal representative of an individual, you may
use the Services on behalf of this individual. If you are consenting on behalf of an
entity, you represent and warrant that you are duly authorized to act on behalf of
the entity and accept this Agreement on behalf of the entity. If you do not meet
these requirements, you must not access or use the Site.
</p>
<p>
You further agree that as a condition to accessing the Services, you will submit to
account verification as reasonably required by TherapyNotes or the Provider, and
provide only true and accurate identification documentation to TherapyNotes or the
Provider (or its third-party vendors) to verify your age and other Account-related
information. It is the sole responsibility of the Provider to verify the identity,
age, and location of all patients and non-patients who utilize the TherapyNotes.com
and/or TherapyPortal.com Services through the Provider.
</p>
<p>
By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority,
and capacity to enter into this Agreement and will abide by all of the terms and
conditions herein.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Establishing an Account and Using the Services</h3>
<p>
Portions of the Services are viewable without registering with us, but to actively
use the primary Services or have us process certain personal and health information,
you may be required to register for the Services (an “Account”) and affirmatively
accept the terms of this Agreement, including the
<a href="/portal/legal/privacypolicy/" onclick="privacyPolicyOnclick(event)">
PrivacyPolicy
</a>.
</p>
<p>
Only one person may use each Account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and
complete information about yourself or the individual you represent (as described
above) when using the Services, such as in the registration form and with provided
account management tools to update Account information. You may be required to
choose an Account name to identify yourself to TherapyNotes in connection with your
Account.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Responsibility for Use of Account</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for all activities conducted through your Account. In the event
that fraud, illegality, or other conduct that violates this Agreement is discovered
or reported (whether by you or someone else) in connection with your Account, we may
suspend or terminate your Account as described in Section 11.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Selection and Use of Account Password</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for providing an Account password, maintaining its
confidentiality, and any harm resulting from your disclosure of the password to any
other person. At no time should you respond to an online request for a password
other than the log-on process for the Services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Fees and Billing for Providers</h3>
<p>
For Providers using the Services: TherapyNotes provides certain aspects of the
Services to you pursuant to fees and other conditions set forth herein or on our
website. We may, at any time and without notice, add new services for additional
fees and charges or prospectively amend fees and charges for existing services. You
acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure payment in full for all paid
aspects of the Services, and to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other
payment instruments accepted by TherapyNotes continue to be valid and sufficient for
such purposes. You represent and warrant that you will pay the charges incurred by
you at the posted prices, including any applicable taxes, and if your initial
payment method is dishonored, you are responsible for any and all charges incurred
including any surcharge we may assign due to such dishonored payment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Modification and Interruption of the Services</h3>
<p>
We may add, modify, or eliminate aspect(s), features, or functionality of the
Services from time to time for the purposes of compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, to effect improvements in security and functionality, to correct
errors, or for other commercially-reasonable purposes, or for no reason at all.
TherapyNotes may on occasion need to interrupt the Services with or without prior
notice to protect the integrity or functionality of the Services. TherapyNotes will
not be liable for any interruption of the Services (whether intentional or not), and
you will not be entitled to any refunds of fees or other compensation for an
interruption of Services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Telehealth</h3>
<p>
Telehealth is included as a component of the Service and gives Providers the ability
to schedule and connect remotely with patients for delivery of care. TherapyNotes is
only providing the telehealth functionality as a component of the Service and is not
providing medical advice. It is the responsibility of the Provider (i) to determine
the appropriateness and medical necessity for the telehealth session to address the
patient/client's needs, (ii) to verify the identity, location, and ages of all
patients and other attendees on the telehealth session, (iii) to obtain all consents
and other documentation from its patient(s)/client(s), and (iv) to confirm that the
necessary licenses and qualifications are in place to deliver the telehealth medical
service. THERAPYNOTES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY IDENTITY,
LOCATION, OR AGE VERIFICATION, PROFESSIONAL, DIAGNOSTIC OR MEDICAL SERVICES, MEDICAL
OR BEHAVIORAL/MENTAL HEALTH ADVICE, MEDICATION RECOMMENDATIONS OR PRESCRIPTIONS
PROVIDED OR COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE TELEHEALTH SERVICE COMPONENT. Additionally,
Provider accepts full responsibility for verifying the internet connection and
hardware configuration of the telehealth session. TherapyNotes accepts no
responsibility or liability for internet connections/outages, hardware issues,
third-party outages or interruptions, or any other interruptions or outages to the
telehealth session.

<h3>Your Rights and Obligations with Respect to Your User Data</h3>
<p>
Any information that you upload or submit to us in connection with the Services or
your Account, including but not limited to Protected Health Information (defined
below), is referred to in this Agreement as “User Data”. You retain all Intellectual
Property Rights in your User Data, subject to the rights, licenses, and other terms
of this Agreement. “Intellectual Property Rights” means copyrights, trademarks,
service marks, trade dress, publicity rights, database rights, patent rights, and
other intellectual property rights or proprietary rights recognized by law.
</p>
<p>
You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have all necessary Intellectual
Property Rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to use—and authorize

infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, other intellectual property right,
or any other harm resulting from User Data, and hereby agree to indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless TherapyNotes, its agents, officers, and assigns for any such
actions. Because you alone are responsible for User Data, you may expose yourself to
liability if you submit data without all necessary rights and consents.
</p>
<p>
You agree that by providing any User Data in connection with the Services or your
Account, you are granting TherapyNotes a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare
derivative works of, and display the User Data non-publicly and internally to

includes the right to copy, analyze and use any of your User Data as TherapyNotes
may deem necessary or desirable for troubleshooting, debugging, testing, supporting,
enhancing or developing services in connection with the Services and future
improvements to the Services. The license granted in this section is referred to as
the “Services Data License.” You also acknowledge that the Services Data License
granted to TherapyNotes with respect to your User Data will survive the termination
of your Account to permit TherapyNotes to retain server copies with User Data,
including for back-up, debugging, testing and record retention and legal purposes.
</p>
<p>
If you send us feedback, ideas, suggestions, or other materials in regard to the
Services (other than your User Data), you waive any potential Intellectual Property
Rights and agree that we are free to use it for any purposes whatsoever, including,
without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any
liability or payment of any kind to you.

Associate Agreement between the parties, and applicable law, including but not
limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and any
implementing regulations, as amended (“HIPAA”). With respect to all User Data,
including PHI, TherapyNotes will comply with the terms of its

<h2>HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION</h2>
<ol class="ToS__AlphaList">
<li>
<h3>We Do Not Provide Medical Advice or Medical Services</h3>
<p>
Our Services, including Telehealth, are intended to foster enhanced communications
and coordination between our Users and Providers, including healthcare
professionals. TherapyNotes itself does not provide professional medical advice,
diagnosis, or treatment.
</p>
<p>
THERAPYNOTES IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE
SERVICES FROM PROVIDERS, SUCH AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING
ANSWERS TO ANY HEALTH-RELATED QUESTION SUBMITTED THROUGH THE SERVICES. ANY
INFORMATION THAT THERAPYNOTES ITSELF MAY PROVIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IS
FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NOR DOES
IT REPLACE, PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. NOTHING STATED OR
POSTED ON THE SERVICES BY THERAPYNOTES IS INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO
BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, DENTISTRY, NURSING, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE
ADVICE, OR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE.
</p>
<p>
DO NOT DISREGARD, AVOID, OR DELAY OBTAINING MEDICAL ADVICE FROM A QUALIFIED
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. DO NOT USE THE SERVICES FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCY NEEDS. IF YOU
EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND 911.
YOUR USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
</p>
<p>
We do not recommend or endorse any specific Providers, tests, procedures, opinions,
or other information that may appear through the Services. If you rely on any
information provided through the Services, you do so solely at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
Our Services are provided to Users through TherapyPortal.com free of charge. Usual,
customary, and any other charges for any medical or related services rendered by
Providers will apply and will be entirely your responsibility (including through
your insurance). You must resolve any dispute between you or any Provider directly
with the Provider, even if scheduling or other interactions were facilitated by our
Services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>No Doctor Patient Relationship</h3>
<p>
NO LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED BY USING
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, OR THROUGH THE USE OF, THE SERVICES OR THROUGH ANY OTHER
COMMUNICATIONS FROM US. WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS,
EXPERTISE, QUALITY OF WORK, PRICE OR COST INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION THROUGH
THE SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY ENDORSE OR RECOMMEND ANY INDIVIDUAL
LISTED OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN BY YOU IN RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH
INFORMATION.
</p>
<p>
We have no control over, and cannot guarantee the availability of, any Provider at
any particular time. We will not be liable for cancelled or otherwise unfulfilled
appointments, or any injury resulting therefrom, or for any other injury resulting
or arising from or related to the use of the Services whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
You are strongly advised to perform your own investigation prior to selecting a
Provider by contacting the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to
verify listed credentials and education, and to further verify information about a
particular Provider by confirming with the Provider's office, your current Provider,
the medical association relative to the Provider's specialty and your relevant state
board.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Important Information About Provider Relationships And Lists; Authorization And
Acknowledgement
</h3>
<p>
In connection with using the Services to locate and schedule appointments with
Providers, you understand that YOU ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN
PROVIDER.
</p>
<p>
Providers listed or accessible through the Services with whom you may book
appointments enter into contracts with us and such Providers generally pay us a fee
in order to be listed and/or marketed through the Services. We may provide you with
lists and/or profile previews of Providers who may be suitable to deliver the
healthcare that you are seeking based on information that you provide to us (such as
insurance information, proximity to your geographical location, and specialty of the
Provider). In an effort to aid in the discovery of Providers and enable the maximum
choice and diversity of Providers who participate in the Services, these lists
and/or profile previews may also be based on other criteria (including, for example,
Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Providers by you or by
other of our users, and past experience of our users with Providers); but we (a) do
not recommend or endorse any Providers, (b) do not make any representations or
warranties with respect to these Providers or the quality of the healthcare services
they may provide, and (c) do not receive any additional fees from Providers for
featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services.
</p>
<p>
IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, YOU MAY AFFIRMATIVELY DIRECT AND AUTHORIZE US TO
SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED PROVIDER(S), INCLUDING YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION.

accuracy, and completeness of any or all such information is not guaranteed. Neither
the authors, editorial personnel, nor any other party involved in the preparation or
publication of information through the Services can assure you that the information
contained herein is in every respect accurate or complete, and we and they are not
responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of

<h2>DMCA POLICY</h2>
<ol class="ToS__AlphaList">
<li>
<h3>Generally</h3>
<p>
TherapyNotes will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The DMCA provides a process for a
copyright owner to give notification to an online Provider concerning alleged
copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is received, the Provider
responds under this process by taking down the offending content. On taking down
content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the
removed content so that a counter-notification may be filed. On receiving a valid
counter-notification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we
receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed
seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the
infringing activity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Filing a Notification</h3>
<p>
A written notification must be made. This can be done either by fax or written
letter (regular mail or courier). Emails will not be accepted unless a prior
arrangement has been made. The notification must:

<h3>
Data Processing and Protection
</h3>
<p>
You are a Business and you designate TherapyNotes as your Service Provider to
Collect and Process Personal Information for the Business Purposes as stated herein.
However, there are circumstances where TherapyNotes is also a Business and Collects
and Processes Personal Information on its own behalf. Where TherapyNotes is acting
as your Service Provider, we are responsible for compliance with our obligations
under this Addendum and for compliance with our obligations as a Service Provider
under the CCPA and the CPRA. We will provide the same level of privacy protection as
is required of a Business under the CCPA/CPRA. You are responsible for compliance
with your own obligations as a Business under the CCPA and the CPRA and shall ensure
that you have provided notice and have obtained or shall obtain all consents and
rights necessary under the CCPA and the CPRA for TherapyNotes to Collect and Process
the Personal Information for the Business Purpose.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Business Purpose</h3>
<p>
TherapyNotes shall only Collect and Process Personal Information as a Service
Provider upon lawful documented instructions from you, including those in the
Agreement, or as otherwise necessary to provide the Services (the “Business
Purpose”). Specifically, the Business Purpose is related to the TherapyNotes
practice management system with functionality to manage patient records, schedule
appointments, meet with patients remotely, electronically prescribe medication,
create rich documentation, to bill the patient and insurance companies, and other
functionality related to the delivery of the Services. TherapyNotes must not process
Personal Information for any purpose other than for the Business Purpose, except to
the extent permitted by the CCPA and/or the CPRA.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Not a Sale or Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Where TherapyNotes acts as a Service Provider the disclosure of Personal Information
to us by you in the course of the delivery of, use of and access to the Services
does not, and shall not, constitute a Sale or Sharing under the CPRA.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Service Provider Data Processing Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
TherapyNotes shall <u>not</u>:
(a) Sell or Share the Personal Information; (b) retain,
or disclose the Personal Information for any purpose other than for the Business
Purpose, including to retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information for a
purpose other than providing its Services under the Agreement or as permitted by the
CCPA/CPRA; (c) retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information outside of the
direct business relationship between TherapyNotes and Provider; (d) Process the
Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising (however, Provider may
disclose Personal Information to TherapyNotes for non-personalized advertising as a
permissible Business Purpose); (e) combine Personal Information with any other data
to the extent this would be inconsistent with the limitations on service providers
under the CPRA.
</p>
</li>
<li>

verified Consumer requests received by Provider to provide information as it relates

TherapyNotes will, upon your instruction, provide reasonable assistance to enable
you to respond to any verified request, inquiry or complaint received from a
Consumer or the California Attorney General in connection with the Collection and
Processing of the Personal Information. If TherapyNotes is contacted by a Consumer
who is your patient/client, TherapyNotes will re-direct that Consumer to you for
assistance with the Personal Information request, when TherapyNotes is reasonably
able to identity the Consumer as belonging to your practice.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Review and Remediation</h3>
<p>
With notice to TherapyNotes and its reasonable consent, Business may take reasonable
and appropriate steps to ensure that TherapyNotes uses the Personal Information that
it Collected pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Business's
obligations under the CCPA/CPRA. Business may also, with notice to TherapyNotes,
take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate TherapyNotes'
unauthorized use of Personal Information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
<p>
If Provider receives direction from a Consumer not to use or disclose such
Consumer's Sensitive Personal Information and TherapyNotes is assisting Provider in
respect of such Sensitive Personal Information, then Provider agrees to promptly
notify TherapyNotes that Consumer has provided Provider with such direction and to
provide details of the Consumer and the Sensitive Personal Information in question.
Upon receiving such notice, TherapyNotes agrees to not use such Sensitive Personal
Information for any purpose, except for the permissible purposes authorized by
Section 1798.121(a) of the CPRA. Provider acknowledges and agrees that TherapyNotes
is only required to limit its use of Sensitive Personal Information it receives if
instructed by Provider to do so and only with respect to its relationship with
Provider.
</p>
</li>
<li>

you. We will use the contact information for you that we have on record.

defend and hold TherapyNotes harmless from any claims, demands, allegations, damages,
losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs) arising from such actions or inactions.
