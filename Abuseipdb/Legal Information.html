<h3 id="sla">AbuseIPDB Service Level Agreement</h3>
<p>
This AbuseIPDB Service Level Agreement ("SLA") governs the use of the AbuseIPDB API pursuant to the terms of the Agreement between AbuseIPDB and the User. To the extent you have more than one AbuseIPDB account, this SLA applies to each AbuseIPDB account individually. Except as otherwise set forth in this SLA, this SLA is subject to the terms of the Agreement and capitalized terms will have the meaning specified in the Agreement. AbuseIPDB reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the Agreement.
</p>
<h4> 1. <u>Definitions</u> </h4>
<ol>
<li> "Monthly Uptime Percentage" means the difference between 100% and the percentage of Unavailable Time for the applicable month. </li>
<li> "Cash Refund" means a dollar value refund, equal to 100% of your usage fees in the month in which the Unavailable Time (as defined below) occurred, prorated to the length of the Unavailable Time. </li>
<li> "Unavailable Time" means the AbuseIPDB API is not available for use, as measured in continuous 5-minute increments. Unavailable Time does not include any unavailability resulting from any Exclusion (as defined below). </li>
</ol>
<h4> 2. <u>Service Commitment</u> </h4>
<p>
AbuseIPDB will make the AbuseIPDB API available 99% of the time each month. If AbuseIPDB’s Monthly Uptime Percentage is below 99% in a given calendar month, then you will be eligible to receive a Cash Refund as described in Section 3 below.
</p>
<h4> 3. <u>Refund Request and Payment Procedures</u> </h4>
<p>
To receive a Cash Refund, you must submit a request to AbuseIPDB as described in this Section 3. You must make the submission to AbuseIPDB Customer Support within thirty (30) days from the time you become eligible to receive the applicable Cash Refund. Such submission must include: (a) "SLA Claim" as the subject of the ticket; (b) the dates and times of Unavailable Time for which a credit is being claimed; (c) any documentation of the applicable outage. Each Cash Refund will be applied to future amounts payable by you in connection with the applicable AbuseIPDB product.
</p>
<h4> 4. <u>Exclusions</u> </h4>
<p>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Unavailable Time shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to any unavailability of the AbuseIPDB API or any other AbuseIPDB API performance issues, that (a) are caused by factors outside of AbuseIPDB’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, any force majeure event, telecommunications provider-related problems or issues, or Internet access or related problems occurring beyond the point in the network where AbuseIPDB maintains access and control over the AbuseIPDB Services; (b) result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party (other than AbuseIPDB’s agents and subcontractors); (c) result from software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (except for equipment within AbuseIPDB’s direct control); or (d) occurs during AbuseIPDB’s scheduled maintenance for which AbuseIPDB will provide at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice; or (e) problems or issues related to alpha, beta or not otherwise generally available AbuseIPDB features or products (collectively, the "Exclusions").
</p>
<h4> 5. <u>Entire SLA Liability</u> </h4>
<p>
This SLA states AbuseIPDB’s sole and entire liability to you and your sole remedy with respect AbuseIPDB’s failure to meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage.
