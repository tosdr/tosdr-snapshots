<p>If you reside in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, our use of your personal information is governed by the GDPR
or applicable EEA, UK, or Swiss national laws. These grant you the following rights:</p>
<ul><li><strong><em>Right of access </em></strong>(Art. 15 GDPR): You have the right to ask us for confirmation on
          whether we are processing your personal information, and access to the personal information and related
          information on that processing (e.g., the purposes of the processing, or the categories of personal
          information involved). You also have the right to access your personal information, by requesting a copy of
          the personal information about you.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to rectification</em></strong> (Art. 16 GDPR): You have the right to have your personal
          information corrected, as permitted by law.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to erasure</em></strong> (Art. 17 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of Art. 17 GDPR, you
          have the right to ask us to delete your personal information, as permitted by law. This right may be exercised
          among other things: (i) when your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it
          was collected or otherwise processed; (ii) when you withdraw consent on which processing is based on your
          consent and where there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii) when you object to processing that is
          necessary for our legitimate interests (pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR) and there are no overriding legitimate
          grounds for the processing, or when you object to your personal information being used for direct marketing
          purposes (pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR); or (iv) when your personal information has been unlawfully processed.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to restriction of processing</em></strong> (Art. 18 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of
          Art. 18 GDPR, you have the right to request the restriction of our processing under limited circumstances,
          including: when the accuracy of your personal information is contested; when the processing is unlawful and
          you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of the use of your personal
          information instead; and when you have objected to processing that is necessary for our legitimate interests
          (pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR) pending the verification whether our legitimate interest overrides your grounds.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to data portability</em></strong> (Art. 20 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of Art. 20
          GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal information that you have provided to us, in a structured,
          commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that information to another
          controller, including to have it transmitted directly, where technically feasible.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR): </em></strong>You have the right to object to our processing of
          your personal information, as permitted by law. This right is limited to processing that is necessary for the
          performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          the controller or processing which is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(e) or
          (f) GDPR), and includes profiling based on those provisions, and processing for direct marketing purposes.
        </li><li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> (Art. 7(3) GDPR): where we process your personal information on
          the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, such withdrawal
          does not affect the lawfulness of the processing that occurred prior to such withdrawal.

<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="when-you-stop-playing">When you stop playing</h3>
<p>If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to
permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to
ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. Your geocache and trackable logs and any
images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which
they are associated unless you delete them. If you have provided personal information or content that other
users need to use in relation to the services (for example, information about a particular geocache you have
logged or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals
about a particular trackable), we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the services to
our other users, but you may always delete that information if you wish. We know that sometimes users take a
break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your
account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We may contact you if
you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently
delete your information. However, after three years of inactivity, we may delete your account without contacting
you.</p>
<p>Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted, we cannot get it back. If you
don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, except as provided above, we will keep
it until you want to reactivate your account, and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy
policy.</p>
<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="information-provided-for-a-specific-purpose">Information provided for a specific purpose</h3>
<p>If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal
information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. Specifically:</p>
<ul><li>If you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for
          as long as necessary to administer the competition, typically about a year.
        </li><li>We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in
          marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new services. You will always have the choice of opting out of
          receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can
          but typically within 10 business days.
        </li><li>If you have posted content online in the discussion forums, unless you request deletion, we will retain that
          content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.
        </li></ul>
<p>Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our services (e.g., analytics), we
will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We
will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose
for which it was originally collected.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may be required to store personal information beyond the period of time that we need it for
the purposes for which we have collected it, taking into account factors including:</p>
<ul><li>legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain personal information for a certain period of time (e.g.,           compliance with tax and accounting requirements).         </li><li>the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (e.g., for the purposes of a potential dispute).         </li></ul>
<p>If a law requires us to hold onto your personal information, we will store your data for the amount of time
required by that law. Further, we will store your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interest,
such as the requirement to create proper documentation of our business operations.</p>
<h2 id="C9">PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We have implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information, you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We and our payment card processors work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of transport layer security (TLS), which encrypts the information you input.</p>
<h2 id="C10">HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKERS</h2>
<p>We also collect data about your use of our services through a variety of tracking technologies, such as cookies, pixels, and software development kits (SDKs). We use these trackers on our websites, in our email communications, and – to a more limited extent – on our mobile applications.</p>
