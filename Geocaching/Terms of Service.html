One of our goals as a company is to keep the world free of abandoned and/or unmaintained geocaches. As a geocache owner, you give us permission to allow other individuals to remove and/or dispose of your physical geocache(s) if any one or more of the following situations are met:
<ol>
 	<li>We have a reasonable belief that you are no longer active in the game.</li>
 	<li>You fail to respond to a communication from us that relates to a complaint from a landowner or law enforcement official within a reasonable period of time.</li>
 	<li>We have a reasonable belief that the geocache has been abandoned (e.g. it’s not actively being maintained or your geocache listing has been archived but the physical container is still in place).</li>
 	<li>We believe the removal of the geocache container is in the best interest of the geocaching game and/or community. If possible under the circumstances, we will make a reasonable attempt to contact you before we take any of the actions above. In the event that your geocache is removed and/or disposed of pursuant to this section, you agree to hold harmless and release from all claims both Groundspeak and any person who has adopted, removed, and/or disposed of your geocache.
