        <p>One registered copy of SyncBackPro or SyncBackSE may be used by a single person who uses the software personally on up to 5 computers to process personal data (home use). One registered copy of SyncBackLite may be used by a single person who uses the software personally on up to 2 computers to process personal data (home use). When used to process non-personal data (e.g. the workplace, but including processing non-personal data on a   personal computer), or the SOFTWARE is not SyncBackPro, SyncBackSE, or SyncBackLite, a separate license must be purchased for each installation of the program.

For                                instance, if 4 different workstations access                                the SOFTWARE on the network, each workstation                                must have its own SOFTWARE license, regardless                                of whether they use the SOFTWARE at different                                times or concurrently. </p>

        <p>• The SOFTWARE shall be identified by                                name and shall be identified as SHAREWARE in                                all distribution. </p>
        <p>• You may copy and/or distribute the SOFTWARE                                only in its original, unaltered form, with all                                files included unmodified, and without making                                any additions, modifications or deletions except                                as provided in this paragraph. You may not modify                                the SOFTWARE or any of its files, and the SOFTWARE                                must be distributed as a complete package.
