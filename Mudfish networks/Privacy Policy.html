  <h2>General</h2>

  <p>
    Mudfish Networks and its affiliates (hereinafter, "we", "us" or "our")
    are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms and Conditions of Use) governs
    our collection, processing and use of your Personal Information. We define
    "Personal Information" as information which identifies you personally,
    e.g. your name, address and e-mail address etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the kinds of Personal Information which we may collect about you
      and how it may be used;
    <li>our use of information regarding IP Addresses and our use of cookies;
    <li>any disclosure of Personal Information to third parties;
    <li>your ability to correct, update and delete your Personal
      Information; and
    <li>the security measures we have in place to prevent the loss, misuse,
      or alteration of Personal Information under our control.
  </ol>

  <h2>Anonymity</h2>
  <p>
    While we always anonymize your true IP address while using the
    Services, remember that no VPN provider can control what other
    apps collect from your device or what cookies other websites or
    third parties place in your browser.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Our product will never store, log, or share your true IP address,
      and we always delete your true IP address after your VPN session
      is closed.
    </li>
    <li>
      We never associate your email, true IP address, username, or
      unique mobile ID with your browsing information or online
      activities when you are using Mudfish.
    </li>
    <li>
      We never share your personal information with unaffiliated third
      parties other than service providers that we use for internal
      technology and business operations
      (such as website hosting, payment processing, data analysis,
      information technology, customer service, and email delivery).
    </li>
    <li>
      We only use your information to provide you with amazing products
      and services that we are constantly working to improve.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>

  <p>
    When you use our Services, we collect information about you or
    your device automatically. Here's a fuller explanation of the types
    of information we collect when you use our Services:
  </p>

  <li>
    When you visit our websites:
    <ul>
      <li>
	We and our third party service providers may automatically
	collect information from your device, sometimes by placing
	cookies, beacons, and similar technologies in your browser
	and on emails that we send you. We may use this information,
	for example, to ensure that the Services function properly,
	to determine how many users have visited certain pages or
	opened messages or newsletters, or to prevent fraud.
	If you do not want information collected through the
	use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers
	that allows you to automatically decline cookies or
	be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer
	to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from
	a particular site. You may also wish to refer to
	<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.
	Keep in mind though, if you do not accept cookies, you may
	experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.
      </li>
      <li>
	Your IP address may be collected when you visit our websites.
	Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done
	automatically by many websites and other online services.
	We use IP addresses for internal purposes such as calculating usage
	levels and diagnosing server problems. We may also use your
	IP address to derive your approximate location. Downloading
	and turning on Mudfish will make your true IP address private to
	our websites, as well as websites of  third parties.
	Using our websites or other websites without turning on Mudfish
	may allow your IP address to be collected.
      </li>
      <li>
	We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model,
	operating system version, browser type, language, wireless network,
	and mobile network information. This information does not
	identify you, and we use it to provide and improve the Services,
	troubleshoot, and perform analytics.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When you launch Mudfish:
    <ul>
      <li>
	We collect your IP address, immediately obfuscate and anonymize
	it, and provide you with a virtual or proxy IP address.
	We may also use your IP address to derive your approximate
	location in order to effectively provide the Services.
	Again, your true IP address is stored only for the duration of
	your VPN session and is cleared after your session is closed.
	We do not associate your true IP address with your online
	activities and we do not store or log your true IP address
	after the end of your session.
      </li>
      <li>
	When you launch Mudfish, we also collect device-specific
	information, such as the hardware model, operating system version,
	browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network
	information. This information does not identify you,
	and we use it to provide and improve the Services, troubleshoot,
	and perform analytics on our services.
      </li>
      <li>
	When you use Mudfish to access the internet, we collect only
	anonymous, aggregate data about which websites you visit and
	which apps you use. We do not attribute any specific website visits
	or app usage to any specific user.
	We collect this information to:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Perform analytics on our services, including measuring
	    whether our users are able to successfully access certain
	    websites or apps;
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Troubleshoot service issues and improve service quality;
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Place generic ads in front of specific apps or websites.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <h2>International Cross-Border Data Transfer</h2>

  <p>
    Mudfish uses servers hosted in the South Korea. Please note that
    we may be transferring your information outside of your region
    for storage and processing in the South Korea and around the globe.
    By using the Services you consent to the transfer of information
    to countries outside of your country of residence,
    including the South Korea, which may have data protection rules that
    are different from those of your country.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>

  <p>
    We use a browser feature known as a "cookie", which assigns a unique
    identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored
    on your computer's hard drive. Information collected from cookies
    is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our Site,
    analyse trends, and administer the Mudfish service. The
    information collected from cookies allows us to determine such
    things as which parts of our Site are most visited and difficulties
    our visitors may experience in accessing our Site. With this
    knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on
    the Mudfish server by recognising and delivering more of the most
    desired features and information, as well as by resolving access
    difficulties. We also use cookies and/or a technology known
    as web bugs or clear gifs, which are typically stored in emails to
    help us confirm your receipt of, and response to, our emails and to
    provide you with a more personalised experience when using our Site.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use third party service provider(s), to assist us in better
    understanding the use of our Site. Our service provider(s) will
    place cookies on the hard drive of your computer and will receive
    information that we select that will educate us on such things as
    how visitors navigate around our site, what products are browsed.
    Our service provider(s) analyses this information and provides us
    with aggregate reports. The information and analysis provided by
    our service provider(s) will be used to assist us in better
    understanding our visitors' interests in our Site and how to better
    serve those interests. The information collected by our service
    provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that
    we collect about you while you are using the Mudfish service.
    Our service provider(s) is/are contractually restricted from using
    information they receive from our Site other than to assist us.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using our Site you are agreeing that we may use cookies for
    the purposes set out above.
  </p>

  <h2>Marketing</h2>

  Mudfish Networks don't use or sell your Personal Information for
  marketing purposes.  You'll get explicitly E-Mail from Mudfish Networks
  for your agreement when Mudfish Networks wants to use your
  Personal Information for marketing purposes.

  <h2>Changes</h2>

  <p>
    Our Site policies, content, information, promotions, disclosures,
    disclaimers and features may be revised, modified, updated, and/or
    supplemented at any time and without prior notice at the sole

    on our Site and will post the amended Privacy Policy on the Site.
