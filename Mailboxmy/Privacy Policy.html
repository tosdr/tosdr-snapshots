                <li>These terms of use form the agreement under which mailbox.my provides services. The most up-to-date
                    terms will be available on this site, and by using our service, you agree to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We provide an email forwarding service, whereby an email address on one of our domains is
                    forwarded to an existing email account of yours. This allows you to choose an email address
                    you like, at the same time you can continue using your existing email provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For this service, we bill a yearly subscription fee, without selling any permanent rights
                    to an email address or name. Your subscription is billed yearly via our billing provider.
                </li>
                <li>We provide our service on a best-effort basis. Still, bad things may happen, among them, but not
                    limited to, interruptions of service, loss of emails, leaking of personal or confidential data or
                    loss of the email address provided by us due to domain unavailablity.

                <li>
                    Our liability to you is limited to refunding your payments for our service. mailbox.my and any

                <li>
                    Our service is for personal use only. Any email address provided to you, and any accounts on our mail

                    mass mailings, spam, or any illegal activities. You are responsible for the actions of your account. We
                    reserve the right to terminate offending accounts immediately.

                <li>
                    You can cancel your subscription at any time. We reserve the right to cancel your subscription with three months
                    notice. This provision protects us from events outside our control, e.g. domain unavailability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For any cancellation, we will make a best effort to keep your email address working for three more months
                    after the subscription has ended so that you can migrate away without missing any emails.

                    To offer our services, we need to work with some of your personal data. Our aim is to always
                    minimize the amount of data required. In this policy we outline what data is collected, how it is
                    used and how it is protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you sign up with our service, you need to provide your email address for confirmation and for
                    setting up email forwarding. We will store this email address securely on our servers for the sole
                    purpose of forwarding mail sent to you, and contacting you for service-related matters, such as password
                    resets, or new service offerings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you provide feedback to us or contact us for help, we will also store your email and any
                    information you send in order to help you with your request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are an email forwarding service. That means your email passes through our servers. In contrast to
                    many other free providers like Gmail, we never analyze your emails for advertising purposes. We only
                    store your email for the shortest amount required to forward it to your email account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our servers are located in EU jurisdictions.

                <li>
                    Billing is handled through Stripe. We only pass your email address to them so that you do not have to enter
                    it again in the checkout form.  See their <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy policy here</a>.
                </li>

                    When required by law or a court order, we may share the limited information we have with
                    authorities. We will inform you about this if we are allowed to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case of errors, we record short-term logs on our servers for problem analysis. We will never
                    share such logs with third parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On request we will delete any information you have provided to us, including your account, to the full extent
