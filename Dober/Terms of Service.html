The processing and storage of data provided during registration and Account creation is governed by <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" href="/privacy-polity"> Dober`s Privacy Policy.</a>.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> <!-- --> allows you to create two types of Accounts:<!-- -->.<ol><li><strong>Personal Account</strong> <!-- --> - Dober`s registered User account.</li><li><strong>Business-Account</strong> - User (Business-Client) account that provides the ability to use Messenger as a closed communication channel, available only to employees of such Business-Client or authorized users whose access is authorized by the Business-Client.<ol><li>The Business-Client uses the Business-Account Server to store data. Business-Client designates a Business-Account Server Administrator who pre-creates accounts for Users who will access the Business-Account. The Administrator provides Users with a created username and password for the initial login to the account, as well as a server address to connect to. User`s logins may be agreed upon by the Administrator with the Users in advance. The standard Business-account user password is not available to anyone other than that User and the Administrator. After logging into the Business-account User must change the standard password to his unique password, which will be known only to such User.</li></ol></li><li>To create an Account, the User must fill out registration information, such as login, password, User name and nickname.<ol><li><strong>Login</strong>. The user must create and enter a login, which will be the Account identifier. Creating a login you can use latin letters, signs and symbols from 1 to 128, including &quot;underscore&quot;, at the same time, special characters and signs as &quot;@&quot;, &quot;space&quot; and dot &quot;.&quot; in the login are not allowed. Using only symbols or only numbers in your login is not allowed. Login cannot be changed after an Account registration.</li><li><strong>Password</strong>. The User must create a password that can consist of any number of characters and symbols, the minimum password size is one character. It is allowed to use any language by creating a password. After entering and confirming the Account password, the User shall confirm consent in a pop-up window (pop-up) that he/she is familiar with and agrees with the importance of the created password. If the User does not confirm the consent, Account registration is not possible. Dober does not check the difficulty level of the password, but as the User enters the password, Dober may indicate such level. Dober recommends creating a strong password and not to use common words or character sets that are easy to guess or guest-select as passwords.</li><li><strong>User Name</strong>. The User enters an Account name that will appear in the other User&#x27;s address book. You can use any language and any number of characters from 2 to 128 to create a User Name. In case you need to change the User name, you can change it in &quot;Account Settings&quot;.</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>. A unique Account code name , by which other Users can find your Account in the Messenger global search. The Nickname must consist of characters, signs and latin letters from 1 to 128, you cannot create a Nickname that consists only of characters/signs/digits. The use of &quot;underscores&quot; is allowed. The Nickname can&#x27;t coincide with the login and can&#x27;t include special characters and spaces. If you create a Nickname that is already used by another User, you won&#x27;t be able to choose and create an identical one. If you need to change your Nickname, you can change it in “Account Settings”.</li><li><strong>Server</strong>. To register a Business-Account, the User must enter a server address that corresponds to the server on which the Business -Account User`s data will be stored. After entering the server address, the Business -Account User fills in the same registration details as the Personal Account User, namely: login, password, User name and nickname.</li></ol></li><li>Dober has no control over, and has no obligation to control your registration information and/or the security of your password. You are responsible for the security of your password as well as the security of your device to restrict access to your Account by third parties.</li><li>Dober has functionality to identify the Account true owner . This functionality can also allow the User to restore the account in the case of password losing. By using the appropriate features in the account settings, the User may create and specify a Secret word or Character set that is known only to the User and to Dober Support. The Secret word/Character set of Account identification is not a Secret Question-Answer, as it is described in Section 7 of these Terms of Use. In order to change a password or for any other request related to the Account, the User&#x27;s identity and ownership of the Account may be verified by providing the Secret Word/Character Set to Dober Support, which, in their turn, will indicate that the request is more likely to come from a valid Account owner and can be fulfilled. The Secret word/Character set is not required when registering a User&#x27;s Account and may be added by the User at any time by using the Dober Account settings.</li><li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Messenger Account. You agree to notify Dober about any unauthorized use of your Account or any security breach of your Account immediately, including password use (cracking).</li><li>Dober is not liable for any losses you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account, with or without your knowledge. In addition, you may be held liable for any losses incurred by us or another party as a result of someone else using your Account.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>SECRET QUESTION-ANSWER AND PIN CODE</strong><ol><li><strong>Secret Question-Answer</strong>. After registering an Account, Users are encouraged to create an additional &quot;question,&quot; &quot;answer&quot; and &quot;hint&quot; to regain access to the Account in the event of a password loss (the &quot;Secret Question and Answer&quot;). You may refuse to create such a Secret Question-Answer, in which case Dober will not be responsible for restoring access to your Account. In the event that you lose access to an Account because you lose your password, Dober will not be able to restore or provide access to such Account and the data associated with it.</li><li>To create a Secret Question-Answer after registering an Account, the User needs to fill in the lines &quot;question&quot;, &quot;answer&quot; and &quot;hint&quot;. You can use an unlimited number of symbols and characters.</li><li>When regaining access to an Account, the User must enter the full Secret Question-Answer data, including spaces, characters, language, numbers and all characters that they used when creating such Secret Question-Answer. The hint that is created to help you answer the Secret Question-Answer is stored on the server in the unencrypted form so we do not recommend you to write the full answer to the Secret Question-Answer in the hint.</li><li>If the User did not create a Secret Question-Answer at the registration stage, forgot this information or did not create a hint to restore it, to change the Secret Question-Answer the User must go to &quot;Account Settings&quot; and change the current password by selecting &quot;Change Password&quot;, enter the current Account password, then select and fill out the new Secret Question-Answer.</li><li><strong>Pin Code</strong>. To provide additional protection to the Account, Users can create a pin code to log in to Messenger. The minimum number of characters for a pin code is 4 (four), Dober does not limit the maximum number of characters and symbols you can use when creating a pin code.</li><li>Pin code will be requested each time you sign in to Messenger as an additional way to protect against third party access to your Account and the data stored in it. Pin code is not connected to your face id and/or any other method of biometric identification. In case you do not want to enter the pin code every time you sign in to Messenger, you can save it by clicking &quot;save code&quot; in the pop-up window. Then the pin code will be saved and you will be able to enter Messenger without filling it every time.</li></ol></li><li><strong>SUBSCRIPTION AND PAYMENT</strong><ol><li>Dober is a free of charge Messenger, so the User does not need to pay a fee or purchase a subscription to register for an Account and use it.</li></ol></li><li><strong>CHAT ROOMS AND GROUPS CREATION</strong><ol><li>To create chats, Users need to click the button in the lower right corner of the main Account page.

If you have blocked a User, you will not receive messages from him.
