You can read more about this in the Dober<a class="link" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p><ol><li><strong>Personal data collected voluntarily at the initiative of Users. When a User creates a Personal Account to use Messenger</strong>We collect User&#x27;s Personal Data that identifies you as an individual, necessary to create and maintain a User account, and transfer information within Messenger in connection with the use of it. User&#x27;s Personal information includes:<ol><li><strong>Login, account name, and pseudonym (nickname)</strong>To register your account, you will need to come up with a username - a unique name for your account, which you will enter every time you log in to your account on any of your devices, to identify you as a User. Do not disclose your username to any third party to prevent the possibility of your account being compromised. You can add a name (the name under which other users will see you in the messenger address book, the User name is not unique and may coincide with the names of other Users) and a nickname (a unique identifier by which other Users will be able to find you in the messenger database). Note that your name and nickname will be publicly available to other Users. Dober does not require your name and/or nickname to match your actual name. The name and nickname may be fictitious and chosen at your discretion.<!-- -->.</li><li><strong>Password and pin code</strong>.<!-- -->To register an account, the User must come up with a password that will secure login to the account on any User&#x27;s device and a pin code that protects against other Users opening the Messenger, with no integration with Android and iOS security mechanisms. Dober processes passwords, but does not store them. The password hash is also not stored, making it impossible to reverse-engineer a User&#x27;s password. When creating a password, remember that the more complex the password, the stronger the cryptographic protection of correspondence in Dober will be. Dober does not process or store the User&#x27;s pin code.</li><li><strong>Secret Q&amp;A</strong>.<!-- -->When registering an account, User can fill out additional information to regain access to the account if the password is lost. If User does not create password recovery information and, the password is lost, the account will no longer be available without the possibility of password recovery. Do not disclose the answers to the password recovery questions to third parties to prevent the possibility of your account being compromised.</li><li><strong>Public Key</strong>.<!-- --> Each User has its own public and private key. The public key is one of the two parts of a key pair used in public key cryptography, also known as end-to-end encryption, and is used to encrypt a message or data. Dober stores and processes the public key. The private key, on the other hand, is kept secret and used only by the owner to decrypt messages encrypted by end-to-end encryption. With end-to-end encryption, the public key encrypts the data and the private key decrypts it.When sending a message through Messenger, the sender generates a SHA3-512 symmetric key, which is used to encrypt the message with a public key, which is stored on the Public Server or Business Account Server. The message&#x27;s recipient decrypts the symmetric key with the private key, which is decrypted with the password. Dober generates a unique symmetric key for each message.Generation of a unique symmetric key for each message provides an additional level of security during data transmission.</li><li><strong>Profile Images</strong>.<!-- --> You can add a profile picture to personalize your account, Dober does not require your profile picture to match your actual appearance and to be your personal photo. Please note that your profile image is always publicly available to other Users and is stored on the Public Server and Business Account Server in an unencrypted form.</li><li><strong>Audio, video, documents and messages</strong>.<!-- --> We store messages, photos, videos and documents you upload to your cloud chats in Messenger, so you can access your data on your devices at any time without relying on backups. Data is stored encrypted and only available to the sender and recipient.</li><li><strong>Metadata</strong>.<!-- --> Dober may receive and store data connected with your use of the features or Dober functions: login, correspondence, call, video, photo, and the date and time of your call in Dober, to enhance the security of your account and to prevent spam, abuse and other violations of our Terms of Use.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Personal information collected automatically</strong>.<!-- --> When interacting with Messenger, some information about Users is automatically collected from a computer or mobile device.<ol><li><strong>Server Logs</strong>.<!-- --> Our Public Servers automatically collect data when you use Messenger and record it. Dober may collect Personal Information such as: your IP address, to understand the country you are connecting from when you use Messenger, your time zone setting, information about the device and browser type you use to access Messenger, the URL of the website from which you visited Messenger, third party sites you visit to log out of Messenger, and your language settings.</li><li><strong>Device data</strong>.<!-- --> Dober collects data about the devices Messenger is used on, including device type, installed operating system, device settings, application identifiers, and failure data. Device data is stored on the Public Server in encrypted form and is available only to the User, the owner of the login and password owner.</li><li><strong>Location Data</strong>.<!-- --> We receive data from Users to help us to understand your approximate location (the location of the device from which a User connects to Messenger). For example, Dober may determine your approximate location to assist with localisation. Location data is stored on the Public Server in encrypted form and is available only to the User who owns the login and password. Dober does not track Users by their GPS.</li><li><strong>Time and date information</strong>. <!-- --> Dober collects information about the date and time the account was created, as well as the date and time the account was last logged into Messenger, to provide the User with session information that protects and controls the account from unauthorized logins.</li><li>Messenger allows to create a Business Account, access to which is provided by the Dober User (Business Client), the owner of such a Business Account, to other Users. In addition, the Business Client may use its own Business Account Server to store, process Personal Information of Business Account Users who have access to it.</li><li>When a User creates a Business Account in Messenger: We do not collect data from a Business User (Business Client) who uses Messenger as a closed channel of communication available only to the Business Account Users to whom the Business Client has granted access to such a Business Account.Business Client uses its Business Account Server to store, process the personal data of Users to whom they grant access.<!-- --> <br/>Business Account Server Data.When creating a Business Account, the User submits to Dober the Business Account Server&#x27;s address and other data specified in clauses 2.1.1. 2.1.1. to 2.1.7. of the Policy as when creating a Personal Account.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> <!-- --> does not collect or store the data of Business Account Users. Such Users receive access to Messenger from the Business Account Creator - Business Client, who collects, stores and processes such Users&#x27; personal data on the Business Account Server.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> <!-- --> does not use phone numbers as identifiers to create and authorize an account, or to log in to an account by sending an SMS with a code.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> <!-- --> does not use or solicit email from Users to create and authorize an account or recover a password.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> <!-- --> does not integrate with the User&#x27;s device phone book. However, the Users always have access to information about the device from which they used Messenger and can end the session on such a device.</li><li><strong>Dober</strong> does not collect or process special categories of User`s Personal Data (sensitive data), such as information about race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual life and orientation, political views, trade union membership, health information, and genetic and biometric data.

If the Owner/Creator User, before deleting his/her account, delegated his/her account management rights (right to be the Group`s owner and/or administrator) to another User, such Groups will not be deleted and the messages in them will still be readable, the deleted Use&#x27;r account will be displayed as a deleted account.</li></ol></li><li><strong>DATA STORAGE SECURITY</strong><ol><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_1</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_2</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_3</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_4</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_5</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_6<a class="link" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-38-gdpr/">privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_7</a>.</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_8<!-- --> <a class="link" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-38-gdpr/">GDPR</a>, <!-- -->privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_10<ol><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_11</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_12</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_13</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_14</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_15</li><li>privacy_page_item_data_storage_security_and_pro_16</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</strong><ol><li>Dober stores data of Users on its Public server located on the territory of Ukraine and does not transfer data beyond its borders.</li><li>If a Business Account User uses their Business Account Server to collect, store, process data, such Users&#x27; data may be transferred outside of the country in which the User resides, including to the EU, outside the EU, to the United States, and to any country where the Business Account Server is physically located.
