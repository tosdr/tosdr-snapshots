that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience in college and beyond.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">These Terms of Service apply to your use of the services offered by Stryder Corp. d/b/a Handshake or our affiliates and service providers (collectively &quot;Handshake&quot; &quot;we&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), including, without limitation, our user-facing application commonly known as &quot;Handshake&quot; and the features therein, websites, including, without limitation, the joinhandshake.com website, tools, data, and documentation (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;).</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0"><strong>If you do not agree with these Terms of Service, including the Binding Arbitration Clause and a Class Action waiver included below, please discontinue using the Service.</strong></p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">These Terms of Service will change over time. If we make minor changes to the Terms of Service without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Terms of Service on our website. We will notify you by email, through the Handshake Service, or by presenting you with a new Terms of Service to accept if we make a modification that materially changes your rights. When you use the Handshake Service after a modification is posted, you are telling us that you accept the modified terms.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">If you have a written agreement with Handshake that states that it supersedes this Terms of Service (for example if you are a University or Employer Partner), then to the extent there is any conflict between the documents, the provisions in your separate agreement apply.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Handshake takes user privacy seriously and does not permit third parties to bulk collect student data, employer data, job descriptions, or other marketplace information from our Services through the use of automated scripts (“scraping”), similar or other technologies or methodologies. For more information on our privacy practices, please read our Privacy Policy (https://joinhandshake.com/privacy-policy/).</p><h2 class="text-h50 my-6 scroll-mt-24 t-md:my-8 t-lg:my-10" id="h_3a41551ecd9c">Account Creation</h2><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You need to have an account to use Handshake. You can create an account on Handshake as a student seeking a job or career advice, as an employer looking for exciting new talent, or as a career center professional. You agree not to misrepresent any information about yourself in creating or using an account.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0"><strong>Creating a Student Account Associated With Your University:</strong> You may create your Student Account because you are a student at a Handshake University Partner (“University Partner”). University Partners use Handshake as a service provider to manage their internal and external career center functions, such as scheduling meetings with students, arranging events, and passing resumes to interested employers. When University Partners sign up for Handshake, they send us personal information about their students so that Handshake can provide these services.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Your University will send you an email with information about how to enable your Student Account. After you do so, and we confirm your association with our University Partner, we pre-populate some areas of your profile with information your University has provided. We encourage you to review this information for accuracy and completeness. Some of this information may be locked by your University and you cannot edit it using Handshake. If any inaccuracies are found, please update the information or contact your University accordingly.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0"><strong>Creating a Student Account Not Associated With a University Partner:</strong> You may create an account on Handshake if your school is not a University Partner by using your .edu email address.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You have the option to provide additional information when creating your student account, such as a profile picture or professional skills, and to upload documents, such as your resume or transcript. Any information or content you upload directly to the Handshake Service is governed by these Terms of Service.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">To create a student account, you must be at least 16 years old to use this Service. If you are not 16 years of age, please have a parent or legal guardian fill out this form (https://joinhandshake.com/wp-content/themes/handshake/dist/assets/downloads/tos/16-consent-form.pdf) and submit it here (https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to use the Service.</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_b79881ebfb93">Student Account Guidelines</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Your Handshake profile is your first impression for employers around the country. As a rule of thumb, <strong>keep your content and communications on Handshake professional</strong>. Specifically, you are not allowed to post any violent, nude, discriminatory, hateful, or sexually suggestive photos or other similar content via the Service. You are responsible for all content you upload to Handshake.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Handshake allows you to view profiles and send messages to other students and employers through the Service, including students at other Universities or institutions. You agree not to stalk, defame, bully, harass, abuse, threaten, intimidate, or impersonate other people or entities. You also agree not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including spam, copyright infringement, identity theft, or fraud.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You agree you will not attempt to restrict another user from using or enjoying the Service and you must not encourage or facilitate violations of these Terms of Service or any other Handshake terms.</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_b8a8e0c89a3a">Making Your Profile “Public” or “Private”</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Students are given the choice to set their profile as “private” or “public” when they first activate or create their Handshake account. When a student sets their profile to “public,” they can also control the general audiences that can access and view their profile. For Student Accounts initiated by University Partners, student information provided to Handshake by the University is private by default.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">If a profile is set to “private,” employers and other students will not be able to see any information about you, but if your student account is associated with a University Partner, the University Partner will be able to see certain information on your profile, even when set to private. Where available, all Career Center features, such as scheduling and appointments, are still accessible by private profiles. You may still apply for job opportunities or RSVP for career fairs or events when your profile is set to private, and when you do so, limited information in your profile will become visible to the applicable employer(s)—including your name, primary contact email, the University you attend, and your educational college (engineering, liberal arts, etc.)—but any other personal information in your profile will be hidden or masked, including your profile photo, GPA, sponsorship status, professional skills, personal bio, and resume.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You can change your privacy settings at any time while your account is active by opening User Settings from the Account Dashboard.

You are prohibited from creating an account for anyone other than yourself, unless you have received express authorization from an employer or client to do so on their behalf. Employer Partners do not have access to any student profiles unless they are approved by Handshake, or the student’s University, to access student information that the student chooses to share.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">When you create a Handshake Employer Account, we request contact information, including email address and telephone number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative staff and which will be made available on your public profile.

Students will only have access to that information if you make your profile public. Once your account has been approved by participating Universities, you will receive student data through our Service. You are prohibited from disclosing or sharing this information with other parties, and agree to keep student data confidential. You shall only use student data to provide the employer services to the student and not use, sell, or disclose Handshake Data for any purposes including data analytics, data monetization, advertising, marketing or any other purpose even if such Handshake Data is aggregated or de-identiﬁed. You agree to handle and maintain collected student data with equivalent or superior standards as those described in our Privacy Policy (https://joinhandshake.com/privacy-policy/), including the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 regarding any Student Personal Data you receive from Handshake.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You also agree not to use the Service to send spam or other unauthorized communications, and you agree not to use any collected student data for purposes not authorized by Handshake.

If the employer chooses to allow additional individual employees to access the Handshake Service through the Employer Account, you agree that the account administrators are responsible for the use of the Service by those individual employees, including requests related to personal data collected from those individual employees. You acknowledge and agree that Handshake is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may be different than, but with respect to your access to the Handshake Service may not be less protective than, these Terms of Service or our Privacy Policy.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You agree that your use of the Services is for your own internal use as intended by Handshake, and your use is non-assignable, with no right to resell, reproduce or distribute.

However, we do not permit outside services to bulk collect student data, employer data, job descriptions, or other marketplace information through the use of automated scripts (“scraping”), or similar or other technologies or methodologies. To protect our users and their data privacy, moreover, you may not use the data of students or other users for the purpose of marketing any employment opportunities other than the opportunity the applicant applied to through the Handshake Service. For the same reason, you may not store any student’s or other user’s data for the purpose of (1) marketing employment opportunities to the applicant in the future; or (2) allowing any third party to use the data for marketing or any other reason. Third party recruiters are also prohibited from requiring students to create an account on a third-party platform unaffiliated with the company or brand providing the employment role. Any violation of these Terms of Service or any other documentation governing the use of any Service, at our discretion, may result in suspension or termination of the account(s) associated with you or your recruitment service.</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_c756f957f5f6">No Spam</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">We want Handshake to be a platform where employers and recruiters can connect with students and other users in a way that is productive for all involved. To that end, while we allow employers and recruiters to contact students and other users, we do not allow you to use the Service to send unsolicited marketing messages or broadcasts (i.e., spam).</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Spam can take many forms, and our rules, which are meant to address a wide range of inappropriate content or messaging, include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Unsolicited messages that aim to drive traffic or attention from the Handshake Service to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives not directly related to a job opportunity posted on the platform.</li><li>Bulk or repeated identical messages, or high-volume messages with a low student response rate.</li><li>Messages that fail to comply with applicable anti-spam laws and regulations.</li></ul><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">If we determine that you have sent spam or other unauthorized content, we may take any action we deem necessary to protect our users’ experience or the Service, including demanding that you cease violating these Terms of Service, suspending your student messaging privileges, or suspending or terminating your account(s).</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_3fcb2a91f357">Employer Paid Services</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Handshake may offer Employers certain paid upgrades, enhancements or other premium Services to enhance the Handshake experience (“Paid Services”). The use of Paid Services is subject to the payment of fees, as determined by Handshake, and as may be modified from time to time (“Fees”). All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable and may be charged by one of our affiliates and processed through a payment partner. Certain Paid Services and payment processing gateways may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented to you at the time of purchase, access or download. Handshake reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order, or limit quantities purchased, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Paid Services may include a subscription that will renew on a monthly (or other period) basis according to the terms of the subscription. Unless cancelled prior to the end of the then current subscription period, subscription Paid Services will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period, for a renewal period of equal duration at the then current Fees applicable to the Paid Service. By purchasing a subscription Paid Service, you acknowledge and agree that the Paid Service shall automatically renew in accordance with the above terms, and, unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize us to charge your payment method for the renewal term. You may cancel auto-renewal of your subscription at any time by visiting your account management center. When a subscription is canceled, you will not receive a prorated refund, but you will continue to have access to the Paid Services until the end of the term during which you canceled the subscription.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You shall be responsible for payment of all applicable local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies or duties of any nature, including value-added, sales use or withholding taxes (&quot;Taxes&quot;). If Handshake has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you.By initiating an order for Paid Services, you authorize Handshake to request and collect payment through our payment provider, and to make any inquiries necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information. If your payment method fails or is not authorized or accepted, Handshake reserves the right to cancel your order without notice and with no further liability or obligation to you. However, you will still be responsible to pay any Fees that are outstanding if we decide to cancel your order due to your failure to pay any Fees that are owed to us.</p><h2 class="text-h50 my-6 scroll-mt-24 t-md:my-8 t-lg:my-10" id="h_50673fef286e">Career Center Accounts</h2><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Career Centers retain access to data as part of their administrative duties.

In fact, the Services might produce similar responses for other Handshake users who submit questions or inputs akin to yours. These similar Generated Responses requested by and generated for other users are not considered part of your Machine Learning Content.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You should never include personally identifiable information, such as names or addresses, in your Submissions, and Handshake disclaims all liability in connection with your inclusion of such information in your Submission.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">Using machine learning features can occasionally lead to incorrect Generated Responses that may not accurately represent facts or offer reasonable advice. Therefore, it&#x27;s important that you evaluate the accuracy of any Generated Response, especially in the context of your particular situation, which might require human review for a more relevant response.</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_13089f6be627">Termination</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account(s) for violation of these Terms of Service or any other policies associated with the Services.</p><h3 class="text-h60 my-4 scroll-mt-24" id="h_8d8666496b2f">Account and Website Security and Integrity</h3><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">While we take steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, security is a team effort.

Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren&#x27;t allowed under our agreement.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0"><strong>Judicial Forum for Disputes:</strong> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Handshake agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and Handshake consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0"><strong>Limitation on Claims:</strong> Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Handshake products or Handshake Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p><h2 class="text-h50 my-6 scroll-mt-24 t-md:my-8 t-lg:my-10" id="h_696891b99548">Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Handshake’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.</p><h2 class="text-h50 my-6 scroll-mt-24 t-md:my-8 t-lg:my-10" id="h_7e7eb45a0159">Entire Agreement</h2><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Handshake and governs your use of the Service, unless you have a separate signed agreement with Handshake that states it supersedes this Terms of Service.</p><p class="text-b20 my-4 first:mt-0">You will not assign the Terms of Service or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Handshake. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Handshake will be null and void. Handshake may assign these Terms of Service or any rights hereunder without your consent.</p></section></main><footer class="w-full pb-4 pt-10 xl:pt-20 bg-neutral-10"><div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl
