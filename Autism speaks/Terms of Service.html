<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>By registering for, accessing, or using My Autism Guide you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time.  If we do this, we will post the changes on https://guide.autismspeaks.org and will indicate at the top of the Terms of Service page the date these terms were last revised. We will also endeavor to notify you, either through My Autism Guide user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means.  Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of My Autism Guide or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of My Autism Guide after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.  </span></p>

<p><span><strong><em><span>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS.  THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST AUTISM SPEAKS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</span></em></strong></span></p>

		<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration.</strong></span><span>  </span><span><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong></span></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.  </strong></span><span>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.”  You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Autism Speaks, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), My Autism Guide, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Autism Speaks are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></span><span>.  </span><span><strong>YOU AND AUTISM SPEAKS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND AUTISM SPEAKS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  </strong></span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong></span><span>.  Autism Speaks is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most My Autism Guide Portal user concerns can be resolved quickly and to My Autism Guide user’s satisfaction by emailing user support at guide@autismspeaks.org.  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“</span><span><strong>Notice</strong></span><span>”).  The Notice to Autism Speaks should be sent to 1060 State Road, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> Fl, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 Attn: Legal Department (“</span><span><strong>Notice Address</strong></span><span>”).  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  If Autism Speaks and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Autism Speaks may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Autism Speaks or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Autism Speaks is entitled.  </span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></span><span>.</span></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“</span><span><strong>AAA</strong></span><span>”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “</span><span><strong>AAA Rules</strong></span><span>”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span>Unless Autism Speaks and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  </span></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong></span><span>.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  Any payment of attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with arbitration or as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service will be governed by the AAA Rules.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Confidentiality</strong></span><span>.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Severability.  </strong></span><span>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection 15.2 titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection 15.2 above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.  The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.  </strong></span><span>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection 15.2 titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection 15.2 above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.  The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</span></p>

		<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span><strong>Termination</strong></span><span>.  </span></p>

		<ol>

			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span>You agree that Autism Speaks, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of My Autism Guide and remove and discard any content within My Autism Guide, for any reason, including, without limitation, (i) for lack of use, (ii) if Autism Speaks believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service, (iii) if you have breached any provision of these Terms of Service (or have acted in manner which shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with, the provisions of the Terms of Service), (iv) Autism Speaks is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of My Autism Guide to you is, or becomes, unlawful), (v) Autism Speaks is transitioning to no longer providing My Autism Guide to users in the country or state in which you reside or from which you use My Autism Guide, or (vi) the provision of My Autism Guide to you by Autism Speaks is, in Autism Speaks’ opinion, no longer commercially or financially viable.   Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of My Autism Guide, and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Autism Speaks may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing My Autism Guide, or any part thereof, with or without notice.  You agree that any termination of your access to My Autism Guide under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Autism Speaks may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or My Autism Guide.  Further, you agree that Autism Speaks will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to My Autism Guide.</span></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt;"><span>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Autism Speaks and govern your use of My Autism Guide, superseding any prior agreements between you and Autism Speaks with respect to My Autism Guide. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Autism Speaks agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, NY. The failure of Autism Speaks to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of My Autism Guide or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.  A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Autism Speaks, but Autism Speaks may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. My Autism Guide may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on My Autism Guide.</span></p>
