                            GT Booster, as well as our third party service providers and partners, operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal data, we may transfer the data to adequate countries other than the country in which you reside; these transfers are permitted and legal under the GDPR. These countries may have different data protection laws to the laws of your country. Whenever GT Booster transfers personal data beyond the country of origin, we will do so in accordance with all applicable local privacy laws and regulations.<br><br>
                            When transferring personal data originating in the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>") to a GT Booster entity, third party service providers or partners located in a country that does not have an "adequate level of protection" as determined by the European Commission, we do so on the basis of our EEA Binding Corporate Rules and/or the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses.<br><br>
                            As to the processing of personal data relating to individuals in China outside of China, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the Personal Information Protection Law.

                        <div class="info">
                            GT Booster understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children. We define children as individuals under the age of 16 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction. Unless otherwise stated for a specific Service or Software, GT Booster Services and Software are made for the general public. We do not knowingly collect data from children as defined by local law without the previous consent of their parents or legal guardians or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you believe that we may have collected personal information from a minor without the requisite consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@gtbooster.com">dpo@gtbooster.com</a> and we will investigate and address the issue.<br><br>
                            If we learn that a child's personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as reasonably possible.

Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than the consent. If we are unable to resolve your concerns, you may lodge a complaint with the data protection authorities handling data protection in your country or region.<br><br>

                            GT Booster and our service providers may implement web beacons (often a transparent graphic pixel GIF or PNG image) and other technologies on websites or in emails to measure the effectiveness of campaigns or promotions. We may use the information, such as page visits, email open rate, and link clicks to further improve our Services.<br><br>
                            Many browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that allows you to tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, there is no industry agreed upon standard on how companies should respond to the "Do Not Track" signals, and so accordingly, our Services do not currently recognize or respond to these signals.
