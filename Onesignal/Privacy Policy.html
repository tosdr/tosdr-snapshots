Our servers may send your device a cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and partners may do likewise on our OneSignal Websites, our Clients’ websites, and elsewhere. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.

If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit.
