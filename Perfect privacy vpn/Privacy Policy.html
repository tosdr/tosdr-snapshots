                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p></p>The following gives a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when you visit our website. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Data collection when using the VPN connection</h3>
                    <p>Perfect Privacy's technical infrastructure has been designed and built with the requirement to collect only the absolute minimum of data necessary to operate the servers.</p> <p>Specifically, we do not record or log any user traffic so potential sharing such data with third parties is technically impossible. We do not store IP addresses, access times or duration, nor bandwidth caused by individual users.</p> <p>For the operation of the servers, displaying general server information on the website and for the detection and elimination of potential technical problems, we record the total load of the individual servers. No conclusions about a user's identity can be drawn from this data.</p> <p>For billing purposes and customer support, we store the following account-specific data:</p> <ul><li>Login credentials</li> <li>expiry date of the account</li> <li>Email address (anonymous email providers are allowed)</li></ul> <p>We do not store payment information such as credit card details. These are processed exclusively by the payment service providers (see point 7, "Payment service providers").</p></p>

                    <p><strong>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</strong></p>

                    <p>Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. This data is primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page. The data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>

                    <p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p>

                    <p>When using Perfect Privacy VPN, no personal user data such as IP addresses are collected. Only the login credentials, payment information and configuration settings are being held.</p>
                    <p>The base for data processing is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b GDPR, which stipulates the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for pre-contractual purposes measures is permitted.</p>

                    <p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>

                    <p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
                    <p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
                    <p><strong>IP anonymization</strong></p>
                    <p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>

                    <p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                    <p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>
                    <p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p>
                    <p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
                    <p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link-external">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
                    <p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p>

                    <p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>
                    <p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an Google AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the Google AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
