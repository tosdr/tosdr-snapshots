</p>
<p>At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.

<h2>Subscription cancellations

</p>
<p>1. One day after invoice being overdue 1st reminder is send and the product is immediatelly suspended

<br> 4. 2 days later, (after 7 days of invoice being overdue) product is terminated, however, the whole client's account still remains active for any purchases in the future.
</p>
<p>Invoices for dedicated servers are generated 14 days in advance, if invoice is still unpaid reminder is sent 3 day prior to the renewal date. If payment is missed on the renewal date, dedicated server is immediatelly terminated.
</p>
<h2>Fee Changes
</h2>
<p>The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
</p>
<p>The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
</p>

</span>. Upon receipt of a notification, the Company will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged content from the Service.
</p>
<p>NOTICE: We are an infrastructure provider, meaning we provide virtual and shared hosting and it is up to our customers what they want to run on their server. We do not limit that as long as it is legal. Of course, we have an abuse process in place to ensure that we only host legal content.
</p>
<p>After the above information is received our legal team will respond in the shortest time possible. We take all reports very seriously, however, we do not scan servers, therefore, we can only act after the report is in our hands and can make a final decision to terminate the hosting account or not.
</p>
<p>The outcome is simple. If the service violates any agreements (including but not limited to using nulled licenses or hosting illegal content) we will terminate it immediately and report the activities to a fraud prevention agency and any other law enforcement.
</p>
<h1>Intellectual Property
</h1>
<p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by You or other users), features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the Company and its licensors.
</p>
<p>The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Country and foreign countries.
</p>
<p>Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of the Company.
</p>

<h1>Disputes
</h1>
<p>We strive to protect against fraud and unfair disputes which cause harm to our business operations, therefore customer agrees to pay SimpliServers' reasonable costs of collection of overdue amounts, including collection agency fees, dispute/chargeback fees, attorney fees and court costs where applicable.
</p>
<p>Opening a dispute voids your service(s), account and access to the support systems while the dispute is opened. An example of a dispute is counted, but not limited to a Credit Card chargeback, PayPal Dispute or Claim or Chargeback.
</p>
<p>However, we believe in 2nd chances, therefore we will only suspend the disputed service and attempt to contact the client via any available contact details we have on record.
</p>
<p>In case the client agrees to a mutual dispute resolution we will unsuspend the disputed service within 24 hours after the dispute closure.
</p>
<p>If the client does not agree to a mutual dispute resolution or does not respond within 72 hours, we will proceed with our non-negotiable procedure for handling disputes:
</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Flat dispute fee of 50€ is charged. This covers staff and other costs which occur when the client continue the dispute without mutual resolution.
</li>
<li>All services are instantly suspended and will remain offline until the dispute is resolved. By opening a dispute you acknowledge that you do not require access to any of the data on your services, therefore access to them is blocked.
</li>
<li>We will respond to the dispute via our dispute handling platform.
</li>
<li>Depending on the dispute outcome we will:
</li>
<li>
Dispute favoured in company favour:
<br>
<ul>
<li>We will unsuspend the services within 24 hours after the 50€ fee is paid.
</li>
<li>The client's account remains active and they can repurchase additional services with us in the future.
</li>
<li>Services will not be terminated and access to data is restored.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Dispute favoured in client favour:
<br>
<ul>
<li>All services are immediately terminated with complete data loss.
</li>
<li>We reserve a right to redirect the case to the debt collection agency for the 50€ flat fee, all disputed payment and other fees.
</li>
<li>Services will not be terminated and access to data is restored.
</li>
<li>We refer all disputes of this category to a fraud prevention company to ensure unfair disputes do not happen to us or other companies in the future.
</li>
<li>The client's account is permanently terminated and banned from using our platform.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Termination
</h1>
<p>We may terminate or suspend Your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately. If You wish to terminate Your Account, You may simply discontinue using the Service. At the same time we reserve a right to deny any order.
</p>
<p>Imediatelly once we detect a chargeback, all your services are suspended, until te dispute is resolved. After that it's upon our desition if we decide to close your account or offer you further services on our platform.
</p>
<h1>Limitation of Liability
</h1>
<p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
</p>
