                    <p>We collect data for various reasons, such as:</p>
                    <p>a) <strong>To provide you with software, services, or information.</strong> We may collect data, including your Personal Data, that is required to provide you with software, support, and services, license validation and checking for updates, providing support, reporting issues and bugs, and other processing connected with the use of JetBrains Products or information. We may use collected data to develop and test products and services. You may explicitly provide the Personal Data required for you to receive the software, support, or services, whether you purchase or use JetBrains Products, use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains Account, register for a webinar, participate in a survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing and/or technical information and content. This data may also be collected in the course of your using JetBrains Products. We may use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html">third-party service providers</a>, acting as data processors, to assist us in providing JetBrains Products to you or in our operations. For example, we may use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html">third-party service providers</a> to provide data storage and backup services. The legal basis for this data processing is the performance of a contract between you and us. With your consent, your Personal Data may also be transferred to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html">third-party service providers</a>, acting as separate data controllers, who provide products and services complementary to JetBrains Products (further data processing performed by these service providers is governed by their privacy policies). The legal basis for this data processing is consent.</p>
                    <p>b) <strong>To protect us from piracy and the unlawful use of our software or services</strong>. We may collect data that is necessary to protect us from piracy or the unlawful or unauthorized use of our software or services, or that is necessary to ensure the security of our software or services, including both Personal Data provided by you (see above) and data collected in the course of your use of JetBrains Products.

Such personal data may include your IP address and information about your JetBrains Account. Collecting this data may include asking for your school records to prove that you are indeed a student if you are applying for a student license. </p>
                    <p>c) <strong>To improve our offerings based on usage.</strong> With your consent, we may collect anonymous data based on your use of JetBrains Products. We use this data to better understand the usage patterns of our products and the behaviors of our collective audience. At times, we may share this information in an aggregated anonymous form with third parties. Since the data is anonymous, no personal data is processed. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/cookie-notice/">Cookie Notice</a> for more information regarding the collection of non-anonymous data (cookies) when you are using the JetBrains Website.</p>

We may use and disclose this data where we believe, in our sole judgment, that it is legitimate and appropriate to do so to protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other users of JetBrains Products or services, or where we believe there has been a violation of this Privacy Notice that could affect the interests of JetBrains or its customers for a period corresponding to the statute of limitations.

As permitted by applicable law, we may use such feedback in the form of anonymized quotes or in other ways in accordance with the JetBrains Terms of Use. We also may use data that we collect and aggregate to assist us in determining the appropriate marketing and advertising for our products and services. In doing so, we may share anonymous aggregated data with third parties to assist us with these efforts. With your consent or if permitted by applicable law on the legal basis of legitimate interest, we may also use your contact details to send you commercial communications about our products and services. This may include reaching out to you if you used a trial or EAP version of a JetBrains Product, if you started a purchase process on the JetBrains Website but did not complete it, if you have used JetBrains Products in the past, or in similar scenarios.
