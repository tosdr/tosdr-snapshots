When the user sends an SMS message to one of his/her phone contacts, or when the user initiates a call to one of his/her phone contacts, the phone number is sent securely through PBXIO’ API. PBXIO does not store this number with any other PII, and it cannot be directly or indirectly attributed to any person or persons; PBXIO stores only the phone number and pertinent metadata so as to be compliant with all applicable state and federal laws, and PBXIO does not share this data with any advertisers or third parties under any circumstances. A user can revoke phone contact access on his/her mobile device at any time, and his/her app experience is not hindered or interrupted.\nPBXIO/SUMO VOICE Android and iOS also uses Gravatar, only when enabled via Settings and UIConfigs, which is a service that provides avatar images linked to the MD5 hash of the user’s email address. This means that, only when Gravatar use is enabled, we hash each contact’s email address and send it to Gravatar to try and retrieve an avatar image. MD5 hashes cannot be directly or indirectly attributed to any person or persons, and we only send the MD5 hash to Gravatar, never the email address in plain text. As with phone contacts, a user can revoke Gravatar access at any time in Settings or via UIConfig, and his/her app experience is not hindered or interrupted.\nCollection / Use of Information:\nSumoFiber collects personally identifiable information for the purposes of registering, provisioning, troubleshooting, billing, fraud detection, informing customers of new SumoFiber products and services, and general operations of the SumoFiber website and services.\nSumoFiber will not disclose, share, transfer, sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third party or partners without the consent of the customer except as required to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, enforce applicable Terms of Service including investigation of potential violations or to detect prevent or otherwise address fraud or from enforceable governmental request as required by subpoena, search warrant or other legal process or in the case where failure to disclose information will lead to imminent harm to the customer or others. This includes information derived from registration, subscription, billing information, and use of the SumoFiber service.\nSumoFiber will not display or make publicly available, whether through online directories, customer lists or otherwise, the personally identifiable information collected. The exception to this is a listing within the SumoFiber Directory which is available to all SumoFiber customers. Customers may remove themselves from the SumoFiber Directory by either selecting to not be included when signing up for the SumoFiber service, or by logging into their account and removing themselves from the SumoFiber Directory under the Preferences section at any time.\nSumoFiber will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties private e-mail, conversations, or other communications that are transmitted using SumoFiber services except as required to ensure proper operation of services or as otherwise authorized by law.\nLog data will be retained in original form, gzip-compressed on disk, for 6 months.\nLog data older than 6 months will be measured (zcat log.gz | wc -l) and purged.\nLog data will not otherwise be post-processed or surfaced via web interface through log analysis tools except as accessed internally by SUMOFIBER.\nUser IP address information will be retained in the original logs to support forensic analysis.\nIn the event of drive failure or system fault or system upgrade, reasonable measures will be taken to purge data from equipment replaced under warranty or removed from service.\nSecurity:\nWhen SumoFiber asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just \"surfing\".\nSumoFiber may use all customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful or fraudulent activity or activities that threaten the integrity of the SumoFiber service, our network integrity, or otherwise violate the SumoFiber Terms and Conditions.\nOther:\nThis SumoFiber site contains links to other sites.

SumoFiber does not knowingly solicit or collect customer identifiable information from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. If you believe that a minor has disclosed personally identifiable information to SumoFiber, please contact us so that the information can be removed.\nSumoFiber reserves the right to modify the Privacy Policy at any time without notice.  \nE-mail: info@sumofiber.com \nLaw Enforcement Guidelines\nSUMOFIBER retains customer website client access logs indefinitely for analytics, but will remove or rotate them upon customer request. We retain server logs for up to 30 days for debugging purposes. SUMOFIBER honors specific law enforcement requests for preservation; however, we require that law enforcement serve warrants for extraction. \nTo contact SUMOFIBER:\nDavid Burr\nSUMOFIBER LLC1034 W 500 NCenterville, UT 84014Legal Response Email: admin@sumofiber.com\nSUMOFIBER will hold data for up to six months upon receipt of a specific retention request.

Otherwise, no customer data or demographic information is sold or shared without a warrant or as required by a Court.\nSUMOFIBER charges $250 per hour for administrative services."}}],"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","name":"PRIVACY POLICY","headline":"PRIVACY POLICY","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dave Burr","image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6f46f6c40487029d670d6b3fde31eee0?e=dburr@sumofiber.com&s=300&d=https%3A%2F%2Fui-avatars.com%2Fapi%2F/Dave%2BBurr/300/69D59A/FFF/2/0.40"},"copyrightHolder":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SUMOFIBER"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SUMOFIBER"},"url":"https://sumofiber.help/en/articles/115-privacy-policy","image":null,"mainEntityOfPage":"https://sumofiber.help/en/articles/115-privacy-policy","dateCreated":"2020-02-17","datePublished":"2022-07-18","dateModified":"2022-07-18"}</script>

MD5 hashes cannot be directly or indirectly attributed to any person or persons, and we only send the MD5 hash to Gravatar, never the email address in plain text.
