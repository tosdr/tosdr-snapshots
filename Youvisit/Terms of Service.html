<h4 style="text-align: center;">15. Term and Termination</h4>
<p>These TOUs commence on the date when you accept them and remain in full force and effect while you use EAB Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the TOUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you used EAB Properties prior to the date you accepted the TOUs, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the TOUs commenced on the date you first used EAB Properties (whichever is earlier) and will remain in full force and effect while you use EAB Properties, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the TOUs.</p>
<p>You may discontinue your participation in and access to the EAB Properties at any time.</p>
<p>Termination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Termination of all Services also includes all related information, files and content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of Services may involve deletion of Your Content associated therewith from our live databases.

All provisions of the TOUs which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">16. Arbitration Agreement</h4>
<p>All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the TOUs or the use of any product or service provided by EAB that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and EAB, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the TOUs.</p>
<p>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to EAB should be sent to: 2445 M Street, NW, Attn: General Counsel, Washington DC 20037.</p>
<p>After the Notice is received, you and EAB may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and EAB do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
<p>Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the TOUs. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><u>www.adr.org </u></a>or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that EAB made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, EAB will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
<p>If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
<p>If you or EAB pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
<p>If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and EAB, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the TOUs. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and EAB.</p>
<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and EAB in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND EAB WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>
<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
<p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with EAB.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or EAB may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to the laws of the District of Columbia and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the District of Columbia for such purpose.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">17. General Provisions</h4>
<p>The communications between you and EAB use electronic means, whether you visit EAB Properties or send EAB e-mails, or whether EAB posts notices on EAB Properties or communicates with you via e- mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from EAB in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that EAB provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the EAB Services, please contact our customer service department using the contact information available on the EAB Services. We will do our best to address your concerns.</p>
<p>You hereby release EAB Parties and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any interactions with or conduct of other users or third-party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the TOUs or your use of EAB Properties. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>
<p>The TOUs, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without EAB’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.</p>
<p>EAB shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
<p>Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these TOUs on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
<p>If any provision of these TOUs is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>You may not use, export, import, or transfer EAB Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained EAB Properties, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, EAB Properties may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using EAB Properties, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use EAB Properties for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. You acknowledge and agree that products, services or technology provided by EAB are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States. You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer EAB products, services or technology, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Where EAB requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing EAB with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to EAB is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the TOUs, EAB’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to EAB at the following address: 2445 M Street, NW, Washington DC 20037.</p>
<p>In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
<p>These TOUs are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</p>
