“Service”). By using and accessing the Service, you agree to be
bound by and comply with this TOS. Certain parts of the Service
may require you to agree to additional terms or guidelines. You
may not use the Service if you do not accept this TOS. For
purposes of this TOS “you” shall mean either you as an individual
or the entity on whose behalf you are accepting this TOS and who
is afforded all rights and bound by all terms under the Agreement.
You represent that you are authorized to accept this TOS and
conditions. If you do not agree to be bound by this TOS in its
entirety, you may not attempt to use any MultCloud services or
products.</p>

may not be able to (and has no obligation to you) to restrict any
use of your Content by any other person, including other users,
and that MultCloud has no control of your Content provided by or
to the third-party services that you authorize or enable.</p>
