class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">These Terms of Service (the &quot;<strong>Agreement</strong>&quot;) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Products provided by Uniswap Labs (referred to herein as &quot;<strong>Uniswap Labs</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;, or &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot;).  The Products shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, (a)  <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/" class="terms-of-service__styledLink-sc-165b8gf-5 kbEwii">https://app.uniswap.org</a>, a website-hosted user interface (the &quot;<strong>Interface</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>App</strong>&quot;), (b) an aggregator of various third-party non-fungible token (&quot;<strong>NFT</strong>&quot;) marketplaces (the &quot;<strong>NFT Marketplace Aggregator</strong>&quot;), (‎c) our mobile wallet application (the &quot;<strong>Uniswap Wallet</strong>&quot;) and (d) any other products and services that link to this Agreement (together with the Interface, App, NFT Marketplace Aggregator, and Uniswap Wallet, the “<strong>Products</strong>”). You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Products. By accessing or using any of the Products, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use any of our Products and should not use our Products.</p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">To access or use any of our Products, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface.  If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind such entity. </p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of any of our Products will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use any of our Products to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.</p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb"><strong>NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. Our Products are only available to you — and you should only access any of our Products — if you agree completely with these terms.</strong></p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH3-sc-165b8gf-0 gwYqzI">1. Our Products</h3><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.1 The Interface</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to (a) a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the &quot;<strong>Uniswap protocol</strong>&quot; or the &quot;<strong>Protocol</strong>&quot;); and (b) the NFT Marketplace Aggregator. </p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself has three versions, designated as v1, v2, and v3, each of which comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Ethereum. Uniswap Labs does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Uniswap Labs is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties. The Protocol was initially deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and has since been deployed on several other blockchain networks including by parties other than Uniswap Labs. Deployments on other networks typically make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets that have been &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;wrapped&quot; to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain can effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to as &quot;Layer 2&quot; solutions) are distinct from the original Ethereum mainnet asset.</p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service (with respect to the Uniswap Wallet, this Agreement, and with respect to a third party wallet, the applicable terms of service of such third party).  We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.</p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.2 The NFT Marketplace Aggregator</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The NFT Marketplace Aggregator is a series of smart contracts that allows you to discover, buy, and sell NFTs simultaneously across multiple third-party marketplaces (each a &quot;<strong>Third-Party Marketplace</strong>&quot;). </p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The NFT Marketplace Aggregator enables transactions involving NFTs that are listed on Third-Party Marketplaces. The listing information and pricing for NFTs is determined by the corresponding Third-Party Marketplace on which the NFT is listed. Uniswap Labs does not determine what to list or set pricing for NFTs on those Third-Party Marketplaces.</p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The NFT Marketplace Aggregator may include functionality designed to enable the purchase of all or substantially all of the NFTs in a particular collection (a &quot;<strong>Sweep</strong>&quot;). By executing a Sweep, we will promptly execute a batched smart contract-based transaction on your behalf to purchase the NFTs that are part of the Sweep. In the event one or more NFTs are not available at the time we execute the purchase transaction with the corresponding Third-Party Marketplace, we will refund to your wallet the pro-rata portion of the purchase price for any NFTs that were unavailable, less any Gas Fees. You agree and acknowledge that Uniswap Labs does not guarantee that a Sweep will be successful in acquiring all of the NFTs in a particular collection or that you will achieve any particular financial result or outcome or otherwise obtain any particular economic benefit by executing a Sweep.</p><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">NFTs available for purchase through the NFT Marketplace Aggregator may contain smart-contract terms that specify certain royalties which are payable to the original creator or another individual in connection with a subsequent sale of the NFT (a &quot;<strong>Transaction Royalty</strong>&quot;). The NFT Marketplace Aggregator does not impose any additional Transaction Royalties on NFT transactions. However, the NFT Marketplace Aggregator will pass-through any Transaction Royalties to the extent imposed by the underlying Third-Party Marketplace on which the digital asset is originally listed for sale.</p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.3 The Uniswap Wallet</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The Uniswap Wallet allows you to (a) store digital assets; (b) link to third party decentralized exchanges (&quot;<strong>DEXs</strong>&quot;) and third party decentralized applications; (c) view addresses and information that are part of digital asset networks and broadcast transactions; (d) participate in DEX trades and associated DEX activity; and (e) perform any additional services that we may add to the Uniswap Wallet from time to time.</p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.4 Subdomains</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">The Uniswap Wallet allows you to claim a subdomain that will become your username associated with your wallet address. Your username and profile information, including your bio, profile picture, linked social media accounts and transaction history will be public and accessible by anyone. You may claim a limited number of usernames per device. You may not select a username that misappropriates or infringes the intellectual property rights of others, and you may not impersonate another person or entity. Purchasing, selling or renting a username or profile is strictly prohibited. Username squatting is also prohibited and may result in reassignment of a username. You also understand and agree that if you change your username, your old username may no longer be available. We reserve the right to revoke access to your username at our discretion without notice. Access to your username may be revoked if you violate these terms, violate the law, or engage in behavior that harms our service. The subdomains should encourage connection and happiness, so offensive names may also be revoked.  We may also revoke your username to comply with a legal requirement or court order.</p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.5 Access through Third Party Partners</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">We may make certain Products, including access to our APIs, liquidity services, and data, accessible or usable through interfaces, products or services provided by certain third party partners, such as exchanges and trading platforms (each a “<strong>Third Party Partners</strong>”).  You agree that your use of the Products through an interface, product or service provided by one of our Third Party Partners is nonetheless still subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.6 Other Products</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">We may from time to time in the future offer additional products, and such additional products shall be considered a Product as used herein, regardless of whether such product is specifically defined in this Agreement. </p><h3 class="terms-of-service__styledH4-sc-165b8gf-1 dhdmLm">1.7 Third Party Services and Content</h3><p class="terms-of-service__styledParagraph-sc-165b8gf-6 fJOjbb">Our Products may include integrations, links or other access to third party services, sites, technology, content and resources (each a “<strong>Third-Party Service</strong>”). Your access and use of the Third- Party Services may also be subject to additional terms and conditions, privacy policies, or other agreements with such third party, and you may be required to authenticate to or create separate accounts to use Third-Party Services on the websites or via the technology platforms of their respective providers.
