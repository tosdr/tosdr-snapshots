LIMITED LICENSE TO USE ADVERTISING ASSETS.</h4><p>Affiliate represents and warrants that it submits or contributes content to or owns and/or operates the Affiliate Site and desires to place Advertising Assets on the Affiliate Site subject to the terms of this Agreement. FileFactory makes Advertising Assets available to promote the services of FileFactory. Such Advertising Assets may contain logos, trademarks, service marks and/or identifying words for FileFactory products and services (&quot;FileFactory Services&quot;). You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to display these Advertising Assets throughout the Affiliate Site, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and FileFactory&#x27;s policies and procedures. You may not alter, change, add to, or otherwise modify any Advertising Asset provided by us. This Agreement does not authorize the use of any Advertising Assets for any off-line or non-Internet (i.e., print) advertising or in the use of email marketing or other similar solicitations.</p><h4>4. AFFILIATE&#x27;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR AFFILIATE SITE AND CONTENT.</h4><p>You will be solely responsible and liable for the development, operation, maintenance and all materials, content and Special Links that appears on the Affiliate Site. You shall operate and maintain the Affiliate Site in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We reserve the right to monitor the Affiliate Site to determine if you are in compliance with this Agreement.</p><h4>5. MULTIPLE REFERRAL PROGRAM TYPES; MINIMUM THRESHOLD.</h4><p>As an Affiliate, you may participate in multiple Program Types and be subject to one or more Commission rate schedules (&quot;Schedules&quot;). A current list of Program Types and Schedules are posted on FileFactory. Your participation in a specific Program Type may require you to meet minimum thresholds based upon various factors including, but not limited to, the duration, fees paid, conversion ratio, etc. Commissions may be modified for, or excluded from, certain trial, promotional and similar offers. The prices charged to customers by FileFactory are subject to change at any time. You may not include price information on the Affiliate Site related to any product or service provided by FileFactory. We will use reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product or service that we offer.</p><h4>6. COMMISSION TRACKING AND REPORTING.</h4><p>FileFactory uses commercially accepted methods and practices, which may include session or other types of cookies, to track a person&#x27;s activities while on FileFactory. (To learn more about cookies, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.) Such methods and practices are designed to determine when an Action occurs. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Program Rules for the Program Type, in order for a Commission to be earned, a person referred from the Affiliate Site to FileFactory must be tracked by FileFactory from the time the Special Link to FileFactory is activated (i.e., &quot;clicked&quot;) until the person completes the member registration process and creates an account with FileFactory. We will not be liable to you or any other person for any Commissions or other amounts if we are unable to determine that an Action has occurred, whether due to a visitor&#x27;s or member&#x27;s browser settings, lack of AID, App bugs, antivirus software or otherwise. For purposes of illustration only, when cookies are used, the cookies are generally set to expire when a person using FileFactory terminates his or her browser session. If the cookie session expires before the creation of an account on FileFactory, you will not earn and will not be entitled to receive a Commission based upon any subsequent Actions taken by such person. For purposes of illustration only, if (a) a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from a Special Link on Site A, but does not complete the member registration process and create an account and then later returns to FileFactory from a Special Link from Site B and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A; or (b) if a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from Site A, but does not complete the membership registration process and create an account and later returns to FileFactory and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A.</p><p>FileFactory takes commercially reasonable steps to provide you with online access to track and review (a) Actions resulting in Commissions taken by members directed to FileFactory by the Affiliate Site, (b) Commissions accrued, and (c) certain other information using FileFactory&#x27;s online reporting tools on a password-protected webpage (the &quot;Reports Page&quot;). The Reports Page is usually updated on a daily basis but is not in &quot;real-time&quot; and is subject to final reconciliation, taking into consideration non-completed transactions, Chargebacks, Credits and other potential charges. The form, content and frequency of the Reports Page remain subject to change.</p><h4>7. NO COMMISSION PAID.</h4><p>Not all paid products or services appearing on FileFactory entitle you to a Commission. FileFactory may refuse to permit any person to establish an Account for any reason and may reject any Action that does not meet FileFactory&#x27;s requirements or policies and procedures in effect from time to time. For purposes of illustration only, FileFactory may reject an order for goods or services based upon a credit card with insufficient funds. You shall not earn or be entitled to receive any Commission (a) attributable to any revenue collected by us arising out of any tax, royalty and/or duty that we, or those acting on our behalf, collect from any person using FileFactory, (b) paid by us for any SMS, merchant processing or similar fees or (c) results in Chargebacks or Credits.</p><h4>8. PAYMENT; COMMISSION PAYMENT FLOOR AND SETOFF.</h4><p>FileFactory&#x27;s current policy is to issue any Commission payments earned and owing in accordance with the Program Rules for the Program Type within approximately thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar month when the Commission was earned. All Commissions are payable in USD. To the extent we receive non-USD currency for Actions, such currency will be converted into USD in accordance with FileFactory&#x27;s exchange rate policies and procedures.</p><p>In order to qualify for payment, Affiliate must be actively participating in the Program. An active Affiliate is defined as having generated at least 100 unique completed downloads from your Account during the preceding 30 days, and uploaded a new unique file to your Account on at least 15 of the preceding 30 days.</p><p>If the amount accrued to you for any payment of Commissions is less than the minimum amount established by us (the &quot;Commission Payment Floor&quot;), we will hold such payment until the payment period after the total amount accrued is at least equal to the Commission Payment Floor. The Commission Payment Floor is currently 100.00USD and subject to change at any time or from time to time in our sole discretion. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change in the Commission Payment Floor via email, posting a revised version of this Agreement, posting on FileFactory, or via other methods. If you have not earned or accrued referral fees in at least the amount of the Commission Payment Floor in the six (6) months prior to any given monthly payment period, or if your Account is suspended as provided herein, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion without notice to you, and without waiver by us, to charge you an Account maintenance fee in an amount up to 50.00USD per six (6) month period. The account maintenance fee charged may be deducted and offset against any unpaid Commissions.</p><p>If a Commission is paid or owed and a subsequent Chargeback or Credit occurs, FileFactory may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate this Agreement for cause and/or setoff the amount of the Chargeback or Credit and any related fees from any subsequent payments owing to you. If there is no subsequent payment due, FileFactory will send you an invoice for the amount of the setoff amount, and you agree to pay such invoice no later than thirty (30) days following receipt.</p><h4>9. ORDER PROCESSING; OWNERSHIP OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.</h4><p>FileFactory and its service providers are solely responsible for processing and fulfilling all orders for FileFactory customers, including but not limited to, order entry, payment processing, shipping, cancellations, creditbacks, returns and related customer service.</p><h4>10. NON-EXCLUSIVE LIMITED LICENSE TO USE FILEFACTORY MARKS.</h4><p>FileFactory grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited license to use the logos, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and similar identifying material specified by such FileFactory solely for the purpose of advertising the FileFactory Services through the use of Advertising Assets in accordance with Section 3, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
