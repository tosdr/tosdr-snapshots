        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">In addition to the amounts we charge, you may incur charges from third-party services providers. These third parties may charge you for access to online services, telephone-based services, or other offerings. You are solely responsible for these third-party charges, including any applicable taxes. If we have agreed to provide billing services on behalf of a third party, you agree to make these payments to us. We will not be responsible for any disputes between you and any third party regarding any third-party charges.</p>

In general, we will provide you with notice of any change in our standard prices or fees or new prices or fees. However, if there is a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees, or assessments, or in any third-party charges billed through us, we may not provide notice unless required by applicable law.</p>

        <li>
        <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>d. How we bill you</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We generally bill you monthly, in advance, for recurring monthly Service charges, equipment charges, and fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>UPON REQUEST, YOU MUST PAY THE FIRST MONTH&rsquo;S SERVICE CHARGES, XFINITY EQUIPMENT CHARGES, DEPOSITS, ACTIVATION FEES AND INSTALLATION CHARGES ON OR BEFORE THE DATE THAT WE INSTALL ANY OR ALL OF THE SERVICES.</strong>We may bill you for some Services individually after we provide the Services to you. For example, we may bill you for measured and per-call charges, pay-per-view movies or events, interactive television, e-commerce purchases, and other third-party services after you incur these charges.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">The Service charges will begin on one of the following dates, whichever occurs first: (i) the day you pick up Xfinity Equipment at our service center; (ii) the day you or we install the Services; (iii) the day your order for the Services is entered into our billing system, if Xfinity Equipment is not required; or (iv) five (5) days after the date we ship Xfinity Equipment to you.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You may pay by credit card, debit card, check, or certain third-party services, and we may change the payment methods we accept from time to time. Certain additional terms may apply depending on your selected payment method. If we do not receive your payment by the due date, you agree to pay any amounts due upon demand, regardless of your selected payment method. If you pay by check, you authorize us to collect your check electronically. You may not make restrictive endorsements (such as &ldquo;paid in full&rdquo;) or other statements or releases on or with checks or other payments accepted by us. If you do so, we may disregard the restrictive endorsement or reject the payment.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We may accept a partial payment, but we still have the right to collect the full balance. We will apply any partial payment to outstanding charges in amounts and in the order we determine, in our sole discretion.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We expect you to pay amounts due on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or non-payment will be difficult to calculate or predict, and are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>h. We may charge fees for suspension or disconnection</strong></p>

        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">If you ask us to resume any Services after a suspension or disconnection, we may charge you additional installation or activation fees. These fees are in addition to all past-due charges and other fees. Reconnection of the Services is subject to this Agreement, and applicable law.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>j. We may charge you collection costs</strong></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>YOU AUTHORIZE US TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES.</strong>We will not discriminate in the application of our credit inquiries and deposit policy on the basis of race, color, sex, creed, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or marital status.

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Services, add Services, or fail to pay any amounts when they are due. Subject to applicable law, your deposit will be credited to your account (without interest) if your account remains in good standing for twelve (12) months. We may refund your deposit sooner if all of the Services are disconnected. We will provide this refund within thirty (30) days of Service disconnection and the return of all Xfinity Equipment, or within the timeline set by applicable law. Refund amounts are equal to the credit balance on your account, if any, minus any amounts due on your account.

Customer Equipment also includes certain equipment that you purchase from us (or our agents) under an express sale agreement. Customer Equipment does not include Xfinity Equipment for which you have paid an Unreturned Equipment Fee (as defined in Section 7(b) below).</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You agree that we (or our agents) may access your Customer Equipment in order to configure, maintain, inspect, or upgrade it, set up Services, or install or download software. For example, we may send software, downloads, or updates remotely to modems, gateways, routers, and digital interactive televisions with CableCARDs. These updates may change, add, or remove features or functionality of your Customer Equipment or the Services.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You represent and warrant that you own your Customer Equipment or have obtained the authority to give us access to your Customer Equipment. If you do not own your Customer Equipment, you agree to supply the owner&rsquo;s name, address, and phone number, and evidence that the owner has approved our access, upon request.</p>

        <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>b. You are solely responsible for your Customer Equipment</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We have no responsibility for the operation, support, maintenance, or repair of any Customer Equipment, including Customer Equipment to which we (or third parties) send software or downloads.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We may certify certain Customer Equipment or recommend particular configurations. Any other Customer Equipment or configuration may not meet our minimum technical or other specifications (a &ldquo;<strong>Non-Recommended Configuration</strong>&rdquo;). We reserve the right to deny support for the Services, or terminate the Services, if you use a Non-Recommended Configuration. WE AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 10 BELOW) MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT TO FAIL OR OTHERWISE CAUSE DAMAGE. WE AND THE RELEASED ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR SUCH FAILURE OR DAMAGE.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">Wiring inside the Premises, including additional cable wiring, telephone wiring, and outlets, is &ldquo;<strong>Inside Wiring</strong>.&rdquo; Inside Wiring must not interfere with the Services or the normal operations of our cable network. Upon your request, we can install, repair, or maintain Inside Wiring. If we perform this work, we will charge you for that service. Regardless of who installed it, the Inside Wiring is your property, or the property of whomever owns the Premises. If you do not own the Premises, contact your landlord or building manager about the installation, repair, or maintenance of Inside Wiring. We have no responsibility for the operation, support, maintenance, or repair of Inside Wiring, except as set forth below.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&ldquo;<strong>Xfinity Equipment</strong>&rdquo; means all new or reconditioned equipment that we or our agent provides or leases to you, including, but not limited to, cabling or wiring (except for Inside Wiring, as defined above) and related electronic devices, modems, routers, CableCARDs, and any other hardware and includes all software and programs contained within Xfinity Equipment or downloaded to Customer Equipment by us.</p>

        <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>a. We own all Xfinity Equipment</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You expressly agree that you will use the Xfinity Equipment exclusively in connection with the Services. You agree that all Xfinity Equipment belongs to us or other third parties and will not be deemed fixtures or in any way part of the Premises. We may remove or change the Xfinity Equipment at our discretion at any time the Services are active or following the termination of your Services. You acknowledge that any addition to, removal of, or change to the Xfinity Equipment may interrupt your Services. You may not sell, lease, abandon, or give away the Xfinity Equipment, or permit any other service provider to use the Xfinity Equipment, including Xfinity Equipment for which an Unreturned Equipment Fee has been paid. The Xfinity Equipment may only be used in the Premises unless expressly permitted by us. At your request, we may relocate the Xfinity Equipment for an additional charge. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THE XFINITY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN THE PREMISES OR OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY US, THE SERVICES MAY FAIL TO FUNCTION OR MAY FUNCTION IMPROPERLY. You agree that you will not allow anyone other than us or our agents to service the Xfinity Equipment. You are responsible for loss, repair, replacement, and other costs, damages, fees, and charges if you do not return the Xfinity Equipment to us in an undamaged condition.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">For avoidance of doubt, Xfinity Equipment remains Comcast-owned equipment, and Comcast retains title to all Xfinity Equipment, at all times, including but not limited to after payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee. &ldquo;<strong>Unreturned Equipment Fee</strong>&rdquo; refers to a fee charged by Comcast to a subscriber for any unreturned Xfinity Equipment upon termination of the Services provided under this Agreement. The payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee shall not result in a sale of, or the transfer of title to, any Xfinity Equipment, and such Xfinity Equipment shall remain the property of Comcast, and Comcast retains title to Xfinity Equipment at all times. Comcast in no way relinquishes ownership of (including title to) Xfinity Equipment by the payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee. Even if an Unreturned Equipment Fee has been paid, Xfinity Equipment shall not be resold, used, or operated in any manner. If you pay an Unreturned Equipment Fee and subsequently return the Xfinity Equipment undamaged (with the exception of normal wear and tear), you will be refunded your Unreturned Equipment Fee in full.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">The Services are for personal, residential, non-commercial use only, unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">We prohibit the following activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reselling the Services in whole or in part;</li>
        <li>Using the Services, directly or indirectly, for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable policy that we make available to you;</li>
        <li>Using the Services to transmit, communicate, or store any information, data, or material in violation of any law, rule, or regulation;</li>
        <li>Tampering with, making any unauthorized connection to, or modifying any part of our cable network or the Services for any purpose;</li>
        <li>Attaching any unauthorized device to our cable network or the Services; or</li>
        <li>Attaching anything to the Inside Wiring, the Xfinity Equipment, or Customer Equipment that impairs the integrity of our cable network, that degrades our cable network&rsquo;s signal quality or strength, or that creates signal leakage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You agree not to engage in these or other similar prohibited activities, or help anyone else do so. You acknowledge that you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of all persons who use the Services at your Premises (or any other locations authorized by us). You are solely responsible for ensuring that all other users of the Services understand and comply with this Agreement and any applicable policies. You are liable for all authorized and unauthorized use of the Services. If the Xfinity Equipment has been stolen or the Services have been used without your authorization or in violation of this Agreement, you agree to notify us immediately in writing, or by calling 1-800-XFINITY during normal business hours.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">If you violate this Agreement, or if you fail to notify us of unauthorized use in a timely manner, we may terminate the Services and recover damages. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to precisely calculate our lost revenue from unauthorized Services or tampering, you agree to pay $500.00 per device used to receive unauthorized Services as liquidated damages. These liquidated damages are in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or unreturned Xfinity Equipment, or other equipment owned by us, including any incidental costs. The unauthorized reception of the Services may also result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, and we reserve the right to report any illegal activities to law enforcement.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">In connection with your use of the Services, if you need to access third-party software or hardware, you will be subject to third-party terms and conditions. Certain components of the Services are also subject to our Software License Agreement, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/terms/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0272b6; background-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;">xfinity.com/terms/license</a>.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">If your Services are subject to a minimum term agreement, and you terminate all or any portion of the Services under the minimum term <span style="background-color: #ffffff; letter-spacing: 0.208px; color: #191919;">agreement&nbsp;</span>before the end of the minimum term, you may be charged an early termination fee. Review your minimum term <span style="background-color: #ffffff; letter-spacing: 0.208px; color: #191919;">agreement&nbsp;</span>for additional details.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">If your Services are not subject to a minimum term agreement, you may terminate the Services and this Agreement for any reason at any time. You must notify us that you want to terminate in one of the ways listed on <a href="http://www.xfinity.com/cancel">xfinity.com/cancel</a>. Applicable fees and charges for the Services may accrue until the Services have been disconnected, all Xfinity Equipment has been returned, and this Agreement has been terminated, subject to applicable law or the terms of any agreements we have with governmental authorities. At our election, and subject to applicable law, we may change our policy to continue all Services (or any part of them) through the end of the billing cycle in which we received your notice, which means those Services will terminate at the end of the applicable billing cycle. We may refund all prepaid monthly service fees charged for the Services after the effective date of termination, and we reserve the right to subtract from your refund any outstanding amounts due to us for the Services, for any affiliate or third-party services, or for other applicable fees and charges. Certain fees and charges are non-refundable and are also excluded.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to immediately terminate or suspend the Services without notice for any reason or no reason. We also reserve the right to remove from the Services any information stored or transmitted by or to any users (e.g., email or voicemail). We may take these actions if we reasonably determine that your use of the Services: (i) violates this Agreement, any applicable policies, or any laws, rules, or regulations; (ii) interferes with our ability to provide the Services to you or to others; or (iii) interferes with or endangers the health or safety of our personnel or third parties, including if you threaten, harass, or use vulgar or inappropriate language toward our personnel. We have discretion in deciding whether and why to terminate or suspend Services. If we continue providing Services, this does not mean we have reviewed or approved any use of the Services, or any information transmitted through the Services.</p>

        <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>c. You have certain obligations upon termination</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You must cease all use of the Services as of the effective date of termination. You must pay in full for your use of the Services up to the date that this Agreement is terminated and the Services are disconnected (subject to applicable law).</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">You must return all Xfinity Equipment to us at our local service center or to our designated agent within ten (10) days of the date on which the Services are disconnected. You must return the Xfinity Equipment in working order, with the exception of normal wear and tear. If you fail to return the Xfinity Equipment, we will charge you an Unreturned Equipment Fee. As the owner of the Xfinity Equipment at all times, we have the right to retrieve any equipment you fail to return. We (or our agents) may request access to your Premises to remove all Xfinity Equipment and other material provided by us during regular business hours at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">Any Dispute involving you and us shall be resolved through individual arbitration as described in this Section 13 (the &ldquo;<strong>Arbitration Provision</strong>&rdquo;). This Arbitration Provision is a material and mutually beneficial component of this Agreement. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>a. Definitions</strong></p>
    <p>This Arbitration Provision shall be interpreted broadly. &ldquo;<strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo; means any and all claims or controversies arising out of or related to any aspect of our relationship, including, but not limited to, any and all: (i) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (ii) claims or controversies that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement; (iii) claims or controversies that arise after the expiration or termination of this Agreement; and (iv) claims or controversies that are the subject of purported class, collective, or representative action litigation. However, these terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to this Arbitration Provision. As used in this Arbitration Provision, &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo; means Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and any of its parents, subsidiaries, and other affiliates, each of their respective predecessors, successors, and assigns, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents; and &ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo; means you and any users or beneficiaries of the Services.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>b. Exclusions</strong></p>
    <p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE FOLLOWING DISPUTES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION: (i) DISPUTES RELATING TO THE SCOPE, VALIDITY, OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION; (ii) DISPUTES THAT ARISE BETWEEN US AND ANY STATE OR LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY OR AGENCY THAT IS EMPOWERED BY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAW TO GRANT A FRANCHISE UNDER 47 U.S.C. &sect; 522(9); (iii) DISPUTES THAT CAN ONLY BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE LOCAL FRANCHISE AUTHORITY UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FRANCHISE; AND (iv) DISPUTES ARISING FROM THE VIOLATION OR THREATENED VIOLATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (I.E., COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR TRADE SECRET RIGHTS).</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>c. Right to Opt Out</strong></p>

KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION. ANY SUCH WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO US MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, SERVICE ADDRESS, AND COMCAST ACCOUNT NUMBER, AND A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY US. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY OPTED OUT OF ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCOUNT GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN. BUT YOU MUST SEPARATELY OPT OUT FOR EACH ACCOUNT UNDER WHICH YOU RECEIVE SERVICES. ANY OPT-OUTS SUBMITTED AFTER THIS 30-DAY PERIOD WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE AND ALL DISPUTES WITH US WILL BE ARBITRATED.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>d. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator<br />
    </strong><br />
    Before either party initiates an arbitration proceeding, that party must first provide an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by sending the other party a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). You may download a Notice form at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.xfinity.com/nod" target="_blank" style="color: #0272b6; background-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;">xfinity.com/nod</a>. You may send the completed Notice by U.S. mail to Comcast, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 &ndash; ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION, or submit the completed Notice electronically by following the instructions at <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/nod">xfinity.com/nod</a>. We may send you the completed Notice by either posting the Notice at <a href="http://www.xfinity.com">xfinity.com</a>, your account, or sending you the Notice by mail to the Premises or by email at the email address we have on file for your account. The Notice must include all of the information requested on the Notice form, including, as applicable: (i) the noticing party&rsquo;s name; (ii) the relevant Comcast account number(s) and service address of the Premises; (iii) the Services (if any) to which the Dispute pertains; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (v) an explanation of the specific relief sought and the basis for any damages calculations; (vi) the noticing party&rsquo;s signature; and (vii) if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Comcast to disclose your confidential Account records and other information to your attorney if necessary to resolve your Dispute. You and we each agree to negotiate to resolve the Dispute in good faith, and that neither you nor we may initiate an arbitration proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 60 days of the other&rsquo;s receipt of a complete Notice that includes all of the foregoing information. (If you or we send an incomplete Notice, the 60-day good faith negotiation period will begin only after the complete Notice is received by you or us.) During the 60-day good faith negotiation period, we will meet via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to informally resolve the Dispute. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. Any statute of limitation relevant to a Dispute under applicable law shall be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed Notice, through and including the foregoing negotiation period, and continuing until final resolution of any arbitration proceeding, unless the party providing the Notice of Dispute withdraws or abandons the Dispute at any point, or the arbitration proceeding is withdrawn or dismissed. Failure to complete the requirements of the 60-day good faith negotiation period is grounds for dismissal of any arbitration proceeding, described below.</p>
    <p>Any Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the 60-day good faith negotiation period must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (&ldquo;Arbitration&rdquo;) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the &ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;). You may initiate an Arbitration by sending a demand that includes all of the information required in the Notice to: Comcast, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 &ndash; ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an Arbitrator and applicable fee schedule subject to Section 13(h) herein. The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and-confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in this Agreement. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts in the county and state where you reside, to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>e. Right to Sue in Small Claims Court</strong></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or we may elect to have a Dispute heard in a small claims court in the area where you receive(d) Services from us, if the claim(s) underlying the Dispute is not aggregated with the claim(s) of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>f. Arbitration Procedures</strong></p>
    <p>Any arbitration under this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered to the most recent version of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) Consumer Arbitration Rules and Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (the &ldquo;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&rdquo;), with the exclusion of any associated fee schedules and as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify us about your Dispute. The selection of the AAA Rules is meant to govern procedural issues only, and such selection does not mean that AAA will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0272b6; background-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;">adr.org</a>). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA Rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. A single Arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any Arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you receive Services from us. If you no longer receive Services from us when you notify us of your Dispute, then any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where you reside when you notify us of your Dispute, provided that we offer Services in that county, or in the area where you received Services from us at the time of the events giving rise to your Dispute. The parties may mutually agree that the Arbitration be conducted via electronic or telephonic means, including via the submission of documents only through a desk Arbitration as described in the AAA Rules. The Arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The Arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the Arbitrator&rsquo;s essential findings and conclusions. The Arbitrator&rsquo;s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the Arbitrator&rsquo;s award. An Arbitrator&rsquo;s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>g. WAIVER OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS/RELIEF</strong></p>
    <p>THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED (i) ON A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR (ii) ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY&rsquo;S CLAIM, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>h. Arbitral Fees and Costs</strong></p>
    <p>If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration. However, if the Arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you shall reimburse us for any fees and costs that were advanced by us on your behalf. You may hire an attorney to represent you in Arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys&rsquo; fees and additional costs. You may only recover your attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in the Arbitration if (i) the Arbitration is decided in your favor and to the extent that you could have recovered those fees in court in accordance with the law or statute(s) that apply to the case or (ii) the Arbitrator finds that any Dispute we bring against you was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.</p>
