<p><strong>B. COOKIE POLICY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>The Website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. Cookies are tiny text files that are stored on our website as you browse, to help track your use of our site and to personalize your journey.

Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. SaveFrom uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. </p>

The statistical data collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymous.</p>

This is in order to deliver content, including product related advertisements, relevant to your specific interests on our sites or third-party sites. They may be used by these companies to build a profile of your interests so that relevant adverts can be displayed on other sites. The profiles are built based on a unique identifier that is assigned to the cookie and linked to your browser and internet device.</p>
