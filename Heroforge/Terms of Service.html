	<h3>9.5 NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS</h3>
	<p>Your rights are protected under the Truth- in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act and New Jersey law
		generally. The following provisions in these Terms do not apply to you and are not intended to vary, diminish or
		alter your rights under New Jersey law: specifically, nothing in these Terms limits, varies, diminishes,
		affects, or otherwise voids or alters your rights under New Jersey law as they relate to the following:
		limitations of liability or exculpation (such as limitations on indirect, incidental, special, exemplary,
		consequential or similar damages); dispute resolution; indemnification; venue or jurisdiction; statutes of
		limitation or repose periods for bringing claims; plain language requirements; and warranties. Your rights
		regarding these specific provisions will be governed by New Jersey law. In the event of any conflict between
		these Terms and New Jersey law, New Jersey law shall govern.</p>

	<h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
	<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sky Castle Studios, its affiliates and their respective
		directors, managers, officers, attorneys, employees and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any
		and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection
		with any third-party claim brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties: (a) alleging facts or
		circumstances that would, if true, constitute a violation of any provision of these Terms and Conditions by you
		or (b) arising from or related to our use of your User Content in the context of the website. You may not settle
		any such claim without our express written consent. This defense and indemnification obligation is intended to
		extend to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and will survive these Terms and Conditions and your
		use of the Site.</p>

	<h2>11. Revisions and Errata</h2>
	<p>The Content appearing on Sky Castle Studios’ website could include technical, typographical, or photographic
		errors. Sky Castle Studios does not warrant that any of the Content on its web site are accurate, complete, or
		current. Sky Castle Studios may make changes to the Content contained on its web site at any time without
		notice. Sky Castle Studios does not, however, make any commitment to update the Content.</p>

	<h2>12. Links</h2>
	<p>Sky Castle Studios has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its Internet web site and is not responsible for
		the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Sky Castle Studios
		of the site. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk.</p>

	<h2>13. Disputes</h2>
	<p>By using the website, you agree that any dispute in any manner arising out of or relating in any way to the Terms
		and Conditions shall be submitted to binding arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
		(“JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ arbitration rules, held before a single neutral arbitrator in the Los Angeles,
		California area. The parties to arbitration may use legal counsel at their own expense, and the prevailing party
		shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney’s fees. All costs of arbitration (including arbitrator fees) shall
		be paid by Sky Castle Studios, except only if the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, or that if you
		bring the arbitration, you may be charged an initial filing fee that shall not exceed the filing fees that you
		would incur for bringing an action in court. This provision will not affect any claimant’s rights to seek relief
		from small claims court. <b>Claims brought on behalf of or allegedly representing or including other persons or
			entities, including but not limited to any class, consolidated, representative, collective or private
			attorney general action, shall be a “Class Action.” Notwithstanding anything else in the Privacy Policy or
			the JAMS rules but subject to the exception for injunctive or equitable relief and public injunctive relief
			below, any parties subject to this arbitration provision shall be barred from bringing or participating in
			any Class Action related to a dispute covered by this arbitration provision. You also acknowledge and
			understand that, with respect to any dispute with us, our officers, directors, managers, employees,
			attorneys, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to your use of the website or these Terms and
			Conditions: YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN
			ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT
			INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</b> However, if these Class Action restrictions are ever deemed illegal or
		unenforceable, they shall be severed from this arbitration provision. In that event, any Class Action shall by
		exempt from this arbitration provision and brought in court. This arbitration provision is subject to the
		Federal Arbitration Act, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Judgment on any arbitration
		award may be entered in any court having valid jurisdiction thereof. This clause shall not preclude the parties
		from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court with appropriate jurisdiction, including
		equitable relief or other provisional relief as appropriate and as allowed under this agreement, in which case
		the parties submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of Los
		Angeles, California, Central District.</p>

	<h2>14. General</h2>
	<p>Under no circumstances shall Sky Castle Studios be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting
		directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms
		and Conditions, which include our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, constitute the complete and exclusive
		agreement between us concerning your use of the website, and supersede and govern all prior proposals,
		agreements, or other communications.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the
		changes on the Site and any changes are effective immediately.</p>
	<p>Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other
		form of joint enterprise between us. Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not
		affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of
		any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of
		these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any
		applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms
		and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole. We will amend or replace such provision with one that is
		valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original objectives and intent as
		reflected in the original provision.</p>
