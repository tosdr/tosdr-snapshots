<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FreeUp Client User Agreement - Terms of Use</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This FreeUp Network Client User Agreement - Terms of Use (“Agreement”) is made and entered into between Next Net Media, LLC DBA FreeUp (“FreeUp”) and Client (any references herein to “you,” “your,” “they,” “their” or any other identifiers shall apply to and have the same meaning and effect on the Client), and shall be effective immediately upon all parties having duly executed this Agreement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client desires to use the FreeUp Network, its services and platform to attempt to locate Independent Contractors (“Freelancers”) marketing their Services to potential Clients to satisfy Client’s business needs on a non-exclusive basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FreeUp is willing to permit Client to access the FreeUp Network to locate and potentially enter into independent contracts with Freelancers to perform Services that Client is seeking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Agreement includes ACH Agreement and Credit Card Agreement (referred to as “Other Terms of Use”) and Client accepts any and all terms, conditions and obligations set forth in the Other Terms of Use. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CLIENT’S ACCESS TO THE FREEUP NETWORK.  Client understands and acknowledges that admission and continued access to the FreeUp Network is conditioned on Client’s execution and fulfillment of all conditions and obligations of this Agreement and Other Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Law restricts FreeUp from conducting business with individuals or entities located or traveling in restricted areas. Businesses or individuals in the following regions and countries are not permitted to register for accounts or utilize our platform:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MARKETPLACE CONCEPT - ACCESS TO FREELANCERS ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS. Client understands and acknowledges that FreeUp may, in its sole discretion and subject to certain subjective access criterion, permit an unlimited amount of Clients and Freelancers access to the FreeUp Network.  Client understands that other Users on the FreeUp Network may be engaged, may have previously been engaged, or may engage in the future in the same or similar business activities as Client. Client understands that Freelancers on the FreeUp Network may have other clients both within the FreeUp Network and outside of the FreeUp Network, and may be performing Services similar in nature or the same as those performed for Client for Freelancers’ other client.  Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers are independent contractors making themselves available to perform Services on a discretionary, non-exclusive basis, and any change or alteration of the non-exclusive basis for Services is solely between Client and Freelancer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CLIENT AND FREELANCERS. Client and Freelancer are responsible for determining the manner and methodology for performing any Services.  Client and Freelancer are responsible for determining length of project and any project scheduling. Any equipment, supplies, facilities or any other items necessary for use in and for the purpose of performing Services shall be between Client and Freelancers.  Client and Freelancer are responsible for determining any onboarding related to the scope of Services agreed upon. Clients are encouraged to agree to the scope of hours required for any project with Freelancers in advance and in writing, and FreeUp encourages this practice as an effort to forego any future issues between Client and Freelancers over time expended on Services, where applicable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prior to the commencement of any Services by any Freelancer, Client agrees that Freelancer’s rates must be agreed to by Freelancer and Client, and consented to by FreeUp. Client acknowledges that Freelancer must agree to perform Services for Client.  Client understands and acknowledges that as part of their Independent Contractor status, Freelancers have no obligation to be “on call” at any time or “on call” 24 hours per day and/or 7 days per week for Client. Client further acknowledges that it is not any obligation of Freelancers as part of Freelancers’ access and/or use of the FreeUp Network.  Client and Freelancer are responsible for all other aspects of their business relationship except, however, Client is responsible for complying with all obligations in this Agreement and Other Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CLIENT’S WARRANTIES AND OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ACCESS AND USE OF THE NETWORK.   Client represents and warrants that they will use the FreeUp Network for business purposes only.  Client further represents they are in good standing with all federal, state and local agencies, regardless of where Client’s principal address, principal place of business, or any other locations, whether Client conducts business or has a business presence including without limitation where access to the FreeUp Network or Services provided by Freelancers originate, continue or are completed.  Client represents and warrants they are over the age of 18 years old (if an individual) and eligible to conduct business on the FreeUp Network, regardless of where access or Services originate, continue or are completed. Client shall maintain appropriate legal authorization to conduct business under all applicable laws. Client shall comply with all applicable statutes and regulations. Client represents and warrants the Services sought on the FreeUp Network are for lawful, legitimate, business purposes only.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client acknowledges and agrees it shall be solely responsible for payment to Freelancers through the FreeUp Marketplace for all Services rendered to Client, regardless of whether Services are performed by Freelancer as an individual or Freelancer as a business entity with personnel (“Freelancer Personnel”).  Client agrees it is solely responsible for all payments to Freelancer through the FreeUp Marketplace for Services performed by Freelancer on a weekly basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client agrees and acknowledges it is solely and exclusively responsible for any tax obligations related to its business.  If Client has any other representatives (“Client Personnel”) performing any services which relate to or pertain to any Services in which Freelancers may be performing for Client, Client shall be solely responsible for all wages, pay, costs, expenses, payments, taxes including without limitation value-added tax where applicable, insurance, benefits and any other monetary or non-monetary entitlements of any kind, if any, associated with any Client Personnel. Client agrees and acknowledges that any Client Personnel have no relationship with FreeUp whatsoever and are not entitled to any payments of any kind from FreeUp.  There may be instances where a Freelancer may perform Services at a Client’s site or location, a third-party site or location, or instances where Freelancers and Clients may have in-person contact or meet. That is entirely up to the Freelancer and Client. However, FreeUp discourages this practice. Client agrees and acknowledges that FreeUp is not responsible for any injury or claims of injury, regardless of form, relating to or arising out of any meeting, gathering, or Services (including any travel to, from or during) by or between any Freelancer or Client. This includes without limitation any claims of personal injury or workers’ compensation claims to or made by any individuals.  Client is responsible for maintaining appropriate insurance based on its business and as governed by any applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client agrees and acknowledges that Client shall treat Freelancers as Independent Contractors and that Client is solely responsible for and assumes all liability for any employment classification of any Freelancer or Freelancer Personnel including any classification as employees of Client. Client agrees and acknowledges that FreeUp has no control, supervision, direction, decision-making authority, neither directly nor indirectly, for Freelancer and/or Freelancer Personnel other than Freelancer’s access and use of the FreeUp Network.  Any customer support services provided by Freeup or the FreeUp Marketplace are for the benefit of Users and are not intended to, or to be construed as, FreeUp exercising any control or direction of the independent relationship between Client and Freelancer. Client agrees and acknowledges that Freelancers are not employees, independent contractors or agents of FreeUp. Freelancer and Client are responsible for determining any contract terms between Client and Freelancer including without limitation pay rate, work hours, service dates, and working conditions.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client acknowledges that FreeUp’s only function is to permit Client access to Freelancers on the FreeUp Network that may be able to perform Services that Client is in need of. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CLIENT AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEY ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT FOR ALL SERVICES RENDERED BY ANY FREELANCER FOR FREELANCER’S SERVICES TO CLIENT ARISING OUT OF THE FREELANCER AND CLIENT’S ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF THE FREEUP NETWORK. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS IS A MATERIAL PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLIENT’S ACCESS AND USE OF THE FREEUP NETWORK.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client acknowledges and agrees to maintain an active email address and phone number and to make such address, phone number and, where necessary or requested, other contact information available to FreeUp and Freelancers. Client gives FreeUp express permission to share any and all contact information in the possession of FreeUp with any Freelancers of Client and FreeUp is authorized to maintain Client’s information in FreeUp’s normal course of business. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">TREATMENT OF ALL USERS. All Users, both Freelancers and Clients, are expected to conduct themselves in a professional, courteous manner at all times. Client and Freelancers acknowledge they understand and agree to conduct themselves in a professional, courteous manner toward all Users. FreeUp does not tolerate unprofessional conduct in any form. This includes without limitation reports of any discrimination, harassment, unlawful or unprofessional conduct towards Freelancers and/or Freelancer Personnel and other Clients. Abusive and disrespectful language is not tolerated in the FreeUp Network. Disrespectful language is defined as: profanity, insults, and cruel or violent language. FreeUp considers the Network to be a place free of discrimination and retaliation of any kind and of equal opportunity to all potential users regardless of gender, sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, color, disability, religion, sexual orientation and sexual preference. Clients and Freelancers understand and acknowledge the continued access and/or use of the FreeUp Network is conditioned on Clients and Freelancers maintaining itself in the set forth manner at all times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FURTHER ASSURANCES. Upon request by FreeUp at any time, Client shall provide business records, including without limitation business licenses, or any other documents related to Client’s business activities through the FreeUp Network. Further, Client agrees to cooperate, including in the form of providing additional requested documents in an expedited manner to FreeUp, upon request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">BENEFITS OF THE FREEUP MARKETPLACE - FREEUP’S OFFERINGS.  Subject to FreeUp’s sole discretion, FreeUp allows Client admitted to the Network access to Freelancers admitted to the FreeUp Network in the United States and/or outside of the United States which may be—subject to Client and Freelancer’s separate, express mutual agreement—able to perform Services in which Client has identified it is in need of. Subject to FreeUp’s sole discretion, FreeUp allows Client access to the FreeUp Network to potentially increase Client’s accessibility to Freelancers potentially capable of providing Services that Client has indicated it is in need of.  Subject to its sole discretion, FreeUp permits Clients to accessfreeup.net (the “Site”) and potential Freelancers on the Site. The Site serves as a platform by which Clients and Freelancers can be introduced and may enter into independent contractor agreements for Services in which Clients are in need of. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Based on Client’s expressed requests, FreeUp makes Client’s requests available to all Freelancers on the FreeUp Network and then may use subjective judgment to assist Clients to connect with single/multiple Freelancers on the Network, if applicable, that have indicated they are looking for new freelancing opportunities and that FreeUp has identified as having a skill set and background that may be in accordance with Client’s request. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FreeUp may work with Client and Freelancer and attempt to assist in resolving any issues that may arise in the event Freelancer and Client are unable to resolve any issues amongst themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth more fully herein, FreeUp may identify a new Freelancer for Client if Client’s current Freelancer is not fulfilling the Services agreed to be performed upon Client’s request and FreeUp’s independent assessment of current Freelancer’s performance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">RIGHT AND OWNERSHIP OF WORK PRODUCT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Unless otherwise agreed to by and between Freelancer and Client in writing, upon Freelancer’s receipt of full payment from Client for the agreed upon services, the Work Product (except for any Background Technology), including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product (except for any Background Technology), will be the sole and exclusive property of Client, and Client will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Freelancer has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Client upon Freelancer’s receipt of payment from Client, Freelancer hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Freelancer retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Client’s ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Freelancer hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product. If payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the assignment described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered and paid for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Work Product” means any tangible or intangible results or deliverables that Freelancer agrees to create for, or actually delivers to, Client as a result of performing the Freelancer Services, including, but not limited to, configurations, computer programs, or other information, or customized hardware, and any intellectual property developed in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Background Technology” means all Inventions developed by Freelancer other than in the course of providing the agreed upon Services to Client under the Service Contract and all Inventions that Freelancer incorporates into Work Product.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PAYMENT OF SERVICES. Client agrees and understands that it will be charged the full amount for all hours billed by Freelancer in providing the agreed to Services for Client as entered into the FreeUp timeclock system.  The billing/invoice period is Wednesday through Tuesday. Clients will be billed for Services rendered by Freelancer every Thursday. Client should receive an invoice via email outlining the hours billed by Freelancer for the prior billing/invoice period.  Invoices for the previous billing/invoice period will be submitted to Client on Thursday as well, however, invoices may not be provided prior to Client being charged for the billing period.  Client understands and agrees that this payment, billing and invoice arrangement is applicable to Client regardless of the payment method selected. Client expressly agrees to these payment terms and methodology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client is responsible for full payment of all billed hours for Services provided regardless of whether the Freelancers provide Services to Client directly or a third party engaging in business with Client. In the event a Client has a relationship with a third party by which Services are rendered by Freelancer to such party through Freelancer’s engagement with Client, Client is fully responsible for all hours billed for Services provided to Client, up to and until any third party accesses the FreeUp Network independently.  This includes payments of all fees originating exclusively from Client’s bank account(s) (ACH) and/or credit card(s).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freelancers account for the time spent rendering Services to Client through use of the FreeUp timeclock system. While Freelancers may provide Client with their own invoices, Client is responsible for the time Freelancer accounts for in the FreeUp timeclock system.  Client acknowledges that the FreeUp Network does not use or offer screen capture or screenshot software. Client agrees that the lack of screen capture or screenshot software is not a valid reason for disputing an invoice of billed time for Services.  Client has access to FreeUp’s timeclock system within its FreeUp Account to view billed time at any time. Client can view the FreeUp timeclock by logging into its FreeUp Account on the FreeUp Site.  A video on how to use the timeclock can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8UfX8IEJQk&amp;feature=youtu.be"><span class="s2">//www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8UfX8IEJQk&amp;feature=youtu.be</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All transactions are final.  Client shall review all invoices upon receipt.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client shall bring any questions or concerns pertaining to billing/invoices to the attention of Freelancer and, if necessary FreeUp, within seven (7) days from the end of the billing period.  After this period, and except as set forth herein, any disputes for refunds are between Freelancer and Client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IMPORTANT NOTE: This subsection applies to a Client that found FreeUp outside of Upwork.com.  If Client found FreeUp through Upwork.com, ask for FreeUp’s Upwork Client Agreement - Terms of Use. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client has three (3) options to pay Freelancers for Services rendered.  Client only needs to select ONE option. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">ACH/Bank account on file (Debited weekly)</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Credit Card on file (Charged weekly)</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Retainer (For international Clients only; amount paid upfront for future work)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please Note: Client agrees to maintain a current and satisfactory payment method (satisfactory payment methods set forth below) associated with Client’s FreeUp Account.  Where there is not a current and satisfactory payment method associated with Client’s FreeUp account, i.e., Client is not able to be charged or full payment is not able to be processed (or covered) for all then current invoices related to Freelancers’ Services to Client, FreeUp may recommend Freelancers temporarily pause agreed to Services for Client until a current and satisfactory payment method is provided to FreeUp or the applicable payment processor. Client understands and agrees to these provisions and releases FreeUp and any Freelancers from any liability, claims, disputes or damages in law or equity (collectively, “Claims”) including without limitation any Claims for tortious interference as a result of any temporary pause, delay or termination of Freelancers’ Services related to payment method submission requirements set forth herein and in the Other Terms of Use.  Client understands, acknowledges and agrees to permit FreeUp to seek Client’s contact information and any information relating to payment method submission from Freelancers, if any, to assist Client and Freelancers to satisfy the payment method requirements and to resume Services. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Explained below</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(View all options here: <a href="https://freeup.net/payments/"><span class="s2">//freeup.net/payments/</span></a>):</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">           (i) ACH (Preferred Option) – ACH transaction is the preferred payment method.  FreeUp strongly prefers this option. Savings are then able to be passed onto Users by offering lower Services Fees for accessing and use of the FreeUp Network.  Client can keep its bank account information secure with FreeUp.  Client’s bank account is debited every Thursday for the invoice(s) owed.  See the ACH Agreement for more information.  Set up is fast, easy and secure using Paysimple. NO MINIMUM REQUIRED.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (a)        By enrolling in the ACH payment program, Client agrees to the Client ACH Agreement &amp; Authorization Form, <a href="https://freeup.net/client-ach-authorization-form/"><span class="s2">//FreeUp.net/client-ach-authorization-form/</span></a>.  This allows payments for Services rendered by Freelancers as provided in weekly invoices to be debited from Client’s account.  By submitting banking information, you are agreeing to the ACH Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (b)        $10 may be debited from your bank account to complete the sync.  FreeUp will credit Client’s first invoices from FreeUp account the full $10.00 and Client’s bank information will be stored going forward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">           (ii) Credit Card – Payment of weekly invoices for Services rendered by Freelancers are distributed to FreeUp and then to Freelancers using Client’s credit card. The Client credit card is kept in FreeUp’s system and invoices are automatically charged each week. NO MINIMUM REQUIRED.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (a)        Enroll in the credit card payment program by adding your credit card at https://dashboard.freeeup.com/billing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (b)        Client authorizes Stripe, Bluesnap, Armatic Inc. and any other payment processor (“Payment Processor”) and FreeUp to charge Client’s credit card automatically for all current, past and future Services rendered. Subject to the Other Terms of Use, at FreeUp’s discretion it may choose in the future to switch payment processors from Stripe/Bluesnap/Armatic to another provider upon prior written notice. Client shall indemnify Payment Processor on behalf of FreeUp and its parent, subsidiaries, predecessors, affiliates, members, directors, officers, insurers, employees and agents, for any claim, demand, loss, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, penalties, fines or interest) resulting from any charge or debit to Client’s credit card.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client consents to FreeUp’s Payment Processor storing Client’s credit card(s) on an ongoing basis for the purpose of rendering payments to Freelancers contracted with Client for Services provided to Client, including Service Fees. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (c)        If Client’s credit card is cancelled or full payment is unable to be processed a new credit card must be provided right away.  Client agrees that an updated, valid, and functional credit card must be provided within 48 hours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (d)       Client’s access to and/or use of the FreeUp Network, and Freelancer’s Services, may be suspended or paused if a credit card gets declined and until it is updated and processing can be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (e)        By providing FreeUp and/or its Payment Processor your credit card you are accepting the FreeUp Credit Card Terms which include:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Client authorizes FreeUp LLC to charge Client’s credit card automatically for all payment of all Freelancer’s invoices for current and future Services rendered by Freelancers and submitted to FreeUp at all times during which Client has access to or use of the FreeUp Network. </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Client understands and acknowledges that Client is solely and exclusively responsible for all transaction, credit card, chargeback or other fees.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Client’s credit card will be retained for ongoing recurring payments of weekly invoices for payment of invoices for Services rendered by Freelancer and submitted to FreeUp.  Credit cards are normally charged on Thursday.                                                          </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Backup credit cards/payment methods will be automatically charged if Client’s primary credit card is declined, fails, or full payment is unable to be processed after 24 hours and no other form of payment has been made by Client. Backup credit cards/payment methods will be automatically charged if Client’s primary payment method is retained and the retainer is exhausted (regardless of the reason) or if Client’s primary payment method is ACH and the ACH is returned, declined, fails, or full payment is unable to be processed and after 24 hours no other form of payment has been made by Client. Client authorizes the secondary payment method to be charged without advanced notice of the secondary payment method being charged. Client can contact accounting@freeup.net to add or remove backup payment methods.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (f)        Client agrees and acknowledges that it shall promptly contact FreeUp if there is a concern and/or dispute arising out of or relating to credit card charges and/or attempts to make payment on invoices for Services rendered by Freelancer and submitted to FreeUp, and attempt to resolve any concern and/or dispute, including without limitation through full satisfaction of all Notice and Cure/Dispute Resolution between Client and Freelancer and, if applicable, Notice and Cure/Dispute Resolution between Client and FreeUp, and all other obligations as set forth in the Agreement and Other Terms of Use before seeking a chargeback, contacting its bank or taking any other action.</span></p>

Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers on the FreeUp Network are Independent Contractors with respect to Client and should be treated by Client--under all definitions—as Independent Contractors.  Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers are merely users on the FreeUp Network, accessing a Site by which they are seeking potential freelance Clients. Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers are not employees of the FreeUp Network for any purposes whatsoever. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client understands and acknowledges that a Freelancer has no right or authority, expressed or implied, to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of FreeUp, unless expressly directed or authorized by FreeUp in writing.  Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers have no right or authority to assume or create any obligation(s) of any kind, express or implied, on behalf of FreeUp or to make any representation or warranty regarding FreeUp unless expressly directed or authorized by FreeUp in writing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LIMITED USE OF FREELANCERS.  Client agrees to make no attempt to hire, pay, recruit, solicit, hire, contract with or compensate a Freelancer (all references to Freelancer in this section include Freelancer Personnel) outside of FreeUp that they were introduced to, or contracted with, during any time in which Client is accessing or using the FreeUp Network and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Client’s access to or usage of the FreeUp Network, regardless of the reason. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client shall not recommend, urge or encourage any other User on the FreeUp Network or any third party to not access the FreeUp Network or to do business with any Freelancer they were introduced to, or contracted with, during any time Client is accessing or using the FreeUp Network. This expressly prohibits Client from doing any of the acts set forth in this section through any third party or any recommendation to other parties without recommending access through FreeUp.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client agrees to promptly notify FreeUp in the event that Client learns or obtains any knowledge that any other Client, User or Freelancer on the FreeUp Network attempts to, or actually does, conduct business outside of the FreeUp Network in violation of this section.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the event a Freelancer is hired, contracted, or compensation is paid to Freelancer (outside of FreeUp) by Client or any other party for the benefit of Client in violation of this section, Client acknowledges that there is substantial cost to FreeUp in the pre-vetting of Freelancers for admission to the FreeUp Network and maintaining the FreeUp Network to FreeUp’s standards, both of which are for the benefit of Client.  Accordingly, Client agrees and acknowledges it shall pay to FreeUp the stipulated sum of $5,000.00 and 25% of Freelancer’s total earnings from Client, regardless of whether compensation is paid directly to Freelancer or through an entity for Freelancer’s benefit, for forty-eight (48) months from the date of any breach of Client’s obligations under this section.  Client agrees that the total stipulated sum is a good faith estimate that is a fair and reasonable amount to compensate FreeUp for its lost profits in the form of lost Services Fees.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">          It is not a violation of this section if:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(a)       The Freelancer was not introduced to or interviewed with Client; or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(b)       Freelancer previously provided services to Client prior to Client’s use and/or access to the FreeUp Network. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Provided that Client has not violated the above provisions in this section, Client can seek to buyout a Freelancer for Client to access the Freelancer outside of the FreeUp Network.  The buyout amount is a minimum of $5,000.00 USD for Freelancers located outside the U.S. and $10,000 for Freelancers located inside the U.S., but shall be negotiated with FreeUp directly and is subject to a separate, written agreement.  Any potential buyout is expressly conditioned upon and subject to Freelancer’s express written agreement.  A buyout contemplates only the right to engage Freelancer directly, outside the FreeUp Network.  A buyout does not provide the Freelancer the right or consent to drop or cease performing Services for other Clients accessing the FreeUp Network in which Freelancer has previously agreed to render Services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">USER SATISFACTION.  While Client and Freelancer are responsible for determining the manner and method of any onboarding, if applicable, related to the scope of Services agreed upon, Client understands and acknowledges that Freelancers are encouraged to bill for all time incurred in providing Services to Clients.  This includes any onboarding time.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FreeUp will be responsible for replacement costs for the <i>actual</i> number of hours Client and the former Freelancer billed for onboarding if the former Freelancer becomes unavailable or ceases performing Services for Client absent any fault attributed to Client.  For example, if Client and the former Freelancer billed 5 hours onboarding for the Services agreed to, the FreeUp Network will cover up to 5 hours of onboarding for the replacement Freelancer.  This is applicable for up to 100 onboarding hours, provided that is the number of hours Client and the former Freelancer actually billed onboarding for Services to be provided. Any actual onboarding of the former Freelancer exceeding 100 hours is not covered by the FreeUp Network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (a)        This policy and provisions are expressly conditioned on the former Freelancer becoming unavailable and/or ceasing to perform Services for Client and the unavailability and/or ceasing of Services not being the fault of, or attributable to, Client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (b)        Onboarding/Replacement are limited to Client introducing the Freelancer to its business processes specific to the Service Freelancer is engaged to perform as agreed to by all parties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (c)        FreeUp Network will only pay the replacement costs in the form of a credit on future invoices (FreeUp will make a payment to offset the former Freelancer’s actual onboarding hours) if Client engages a new Freelancer accessing the FreeUp Network.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                       (d)       This does not apply if Client terminates the Freelancer or pauses work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">BILLABLE HOURS. Once Client and Freelancer agree to Services (and Client notifies FreeUp of this agreement so that Freelancer can be added to Client’s timeclock), Freelancers are encouraged to bill for all time incurred in rendering agreed upon Services to Client.  Subject to the Freelancer’s independent business discretion, Freelancers are encouraged to discuss minimum billing of 30 minutes for Services. This may include without limitation all phone calls, onboarding, research, work, consults, emails and time Freelancer spends with Client or at Client’s place of business.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client understands that Freelancers set their own rates, therefore, Freelancers’ rates may vary depending on skills, experience, location, material necessary to render Services and the scope of Services sought by Client. Rates for Services are set by Freelancers.  The total hourly rate includes Freelancer’s agreed upon hourly rate and Service Fees. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">           (i)        Freelancers agree to interview with Clients in the event that a Freelancer is interested in the type of Services sought by Client.  In most instances, Freelancers are encouraged to keep any interviews and introduction to less than 15 minutes. Client has the option of this introduction/interview at their discretion. Upon mutual agreement of Freelancer and Client to contract to perform Services, Client must confirm the hire inside the FreeUp software or notify the FreeUp Network confirming the hire so that the Freelancer can be added to Client’s FreeUp timeclock.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freelancers are encouraged to obtain prior, written approval from Client of hours that Freelancer, in their business judgment, believes will be required to provide any agreed to Services.  Client is encouraged to request an estimate of the number of hours and delivery dates that Freelancer, in their business judgment, believes will be required and achievable to provide any agreed to Services and to reach an agreement with Freelancer on the number of hours in writing and prior to Services being commenced. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Client is encouraged to have a continuing dialogue with Freelancer regarding the progress of Services and the current billing for hours incurred in rendering Services.  Client is not responsible for billed hours exceeding any prior, written approvals within the same scope of Services agreed to so long as the Client files a dispute within six (6) days from the close of the billing/invoice period in which the disputed hours were billed. This does not apply if the Freelancer gets prior approval to exceed any previously approved time restrictions. Client understands that each Freelancer has independent discretion on how (the manner and method) they perform Services and limiting hours may impact performance and results. Client cannot require Freelancer to perform agreed to Services in a time period less than Freelancer’s estimate of the length of time such Services will take to complete, without Freelancer’s express consent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            (ii)        After meeting a Freelancer, Client has the option to interview a Freelancer for 10 to 15 minutes. This 10 to 15 minute interview is free. During the interview, Client should ask Freelancer about their background, skills, experience and other questions regarding the Freelancer. Freelancer is discouraged from reviewing Client’s account(s), providing any consultation, and/or beginning onboarding or commencing performance of any Services until Client confirms in their FreeUp account to hire Freelancer or informs FreeUp of its desire to hire the Freelancer.  Freelancer is then encouraged to bill for a discovery phase if necessary to be able to present Client with estimates and delivery dates.</span></p>
<p class="p1">FIXED PRICING. Under the Fixed Price Structures, the Client funds the project through FreeUp. In other words, the Client is billed the full fixed-price amount upfront by FreeUp. Thereafter, the Freelancer’s fees for the Services are released as agreed upon by Freelancer and Client under one of the fixed price options, below. Client and Freelancer come to an agreement on the Services to be provided and the Fixed Price Amount which shall include FreeUp’s 20% Service Fee.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Binding Arbitration </i></b>(Step 4): If a dispute between Client and Freelancer remains unresolved at the conclusion of the mediation process, either the Client or Freelancer may submit the dispute for resolution by final binding confidential arbitration through the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted under the applicable Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the AAA then in effect. These Rules are incorporated by reference into this Procedure and include (but are not limited to) the procedures for the joint selection of an impartial arbitrator and for the hearing of evidence before the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to allow for appropriate discovery and exchange of information before a hearing, including, but not limited to, production of documents, information requests, depositions and subpoenas. <i>Client shall provide FreeUp thirty (30) days advance written notice of Freelancer’s intent to commence any arbitration proceeding against any Client.

The arbitrator shall have the power to award all remedies that could be awarded by a court or administrative agency in accordance with the governing and applicable substantive law.</span></p>
