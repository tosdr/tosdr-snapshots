Remind&#x27;s mechanisms and policies for compliance with COPPA meet or exceed the requirements of the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation for the protection of the Personal Data of children.</p><ul role="list"><li>For children under 13 using Remind’s messaging or communications Services we may collect a child’s name (first and last name), date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child’s parent’s email address. We collect these in order to notify the parent that we may contact the child for the purpose of providing the Services for which the child’s teacher, Organizer (as described below) or school administrator has signed up to use. For children under 13 using Remind’s tutoring Services we may additionally collect a child’s voice recording. We collect these in order to provide one-to-one, live tutoring sessions, but all of these elements of children’s personal data are deleted within 60 days. Note that if the Remind account of a child under 13 is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not sent or received a message through the Remind Services in that time), Remind’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child’s account. While we delete the account in these situations, some of the child’s data may persist in the files of Remind’s agents or service providers for some period of time until it is removed from their systems as well.</li><li>We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 but only in support of the learning environment. For Remind to collect this type of personal information, a student’s school, district or teacher must agree to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services, or Remind must obtain that consent. The student’s school, district or teacher may disclose that personal information to us for a legitimate educational interest.</li><li>If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are responsible for complying with COPPA in cooperation with Remind, meaning you must obtain consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services or work with Remind to ensure Remind has obtained all necessary consents. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your school or district to use the Services. You also represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school or district.
