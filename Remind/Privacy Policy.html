COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent and provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (&quot;under-13 users&quot;). Remind typically relies on a teacher, school, or school district to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to under-13 users. Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an under-13 user&#x27;s name (first and last name), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the under-13 user&#x27;s parent&#x27;s (or legal guardian&#x27;s) email address in order to provide notice to the child&#x27;s parent or guardian that we may contact the under-13 user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services. For Remind Tutoring, in addition to the information we typically collect, we will also collect a child&#x27;s voice recording in order to provide live tutoring sessions. If Remind does not receive the parent&#x27;s email address within a reasonable time period, the under-13 user will not be able to send or receive any messages and his/her Personal Information will be deleted. If an under-13 user&#x27;s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not sent or received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind&#x27;s policy is to delete the Personal Information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an under-13 user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an under-13 user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it. If you believe that an under-13 user may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at rmd.me/help.</p><p>In order for an under-13 user to gain access to additional features or services, Remind may employ one or more methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission for verifying parental consent.</p><p>While COPPA requires Remind to follow these procedures for under-13 users in the United States, Remind employs the same process to obtain consent for all users under 13 years old.<br/></p></div></div><div class="c-terms-section_right cc-privacy"><div class="c-title-wrapper-terms cc-terms-subtitle"><h3 class="c-text-1-2 cc-600">What this is saying</h3></div><div class="c-terms-rich-right w-richtext"><p>Remind collects limited information from children under-13, and we rely on a teacher, school, or district to get permission from each child&#x27;s parent when collecting this information.

We can then provide you with Remind content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Remind. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.</p><h3>Analytics and research</h3><p>To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.</p><p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer or to share information about our services to you as you interact online across the internet. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Remind by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</p><p>Google Analytics will not collect visitation information and will not associate it with Google information from accounts of signed-in users who have consented to this association for the purpose of ads personalization.</p><p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services&#x27; features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by anyone other than Remind is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over those cookies.<br/></p></div></div><div class="c-terms-section_right cc-privacy"><div class="c-title-wrapper-terms cc-terms-subtitle"><h3 class="c-text-1-2 cc-600">What this is saying</h3></div><div class="c-terms-rich-right w-richtext"><p>Cookies are bits of information that tell us you&#x27;ve visited Remind before and help the browser remember things about you (such as your language setting).

Remind shares your Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below.</p><h3>Agents and third party service providers</h3><p>Advertising is not permitted on the Services, and we do not share information for third-party advertising. However, we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and help us provide certain features of our Services, and may need to share your information with those companies in order to provide our Services to you. We do not permit any of these companies to use your personal information for any purpose that is inconsistent with your use of Remind, or to ensure high quality services for Remind for your benefit, or to protect your personal information. Some examples of services for which we use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, providing user services, and searching for any security vulnerabilities. These agents may use Personal Information we share with them, for example, to assist us, to provide their services to you and/or us, and to measure and improve the performance of their services. Please see <a href="https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/203025679-How-is-my-information-used-in-order-for-Remind-to-operate-the-service">here</a> for further information about the agents we use as part of the Services (including any of their specific terms or policies that are applicable and that may govern use of your information). Remind has reviewed the privacy policies and practices of these agents and third party service providers in order to verify that they are capable of complying with Remind&#x27;s policies and practices, including those related to the collection, use, transfer, confidentiality, security and integrity of user data. As a condition of contracting with Remind, those agents and third-party service providers committed, in writing, to providing at least equivalent privacy and security for your data as does Remind. Finally, these companies are prohibited from accessing your personal information to: (i) create a profile of you for their use; (ii) enhance their data; or (iii) engage in social advertising or targeted advertising.</p><p>Additional Information for EU, EEA or UK Individuals Regarding Transfers to Third Parties Governed by GDPR</p><p>If you are from the EU, EEA or UK and one of our agents or third-party service providers fails to uphold these standards with respect to your Personal Information that we transferred to that agent or provider on your behalf, that agent or third-party service provider may be liable for any injury as required by GDPR.</p><p>Additional Information for EU, EEA, UK and Swiss Individuals Regarding Transfers to Third Parties Governed by Data Privacy Frameworks.<br/></p><p>Remind’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles.
