Account Funding, Orders and Withdrawals</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Withdrawable Credits/Winnings</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As detailed in Section 8, when there is a Winning Ticket with a prize value less than or equal to the In-Store Redemption Threshold, the User will be credited with Withdrawable Credits that may be converted on a 1:1 ratio to U.S. dollars and transferred to a User's eligible bank account.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>2. Non-withdrawable Credits</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Users may also have Non-Withdrawable Credits, which are Jackpocket Credits that may be spent on new Ticket orders using the Application, but which may not be converted to United States dollars or transferred to a User's eligible bank account. Any credits given to a User for any reason other than for a Winning Ticket will be Non-Withdrawable credits. This includes Account Funding, referrals, promotions, contests, compensation, and refunds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>3. Promo Codes</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackpocket may from time to time offer promo codes to be used in conjunction with the order of Tickets on the Application. Promo codes are valid for a limited time only and promo code discounts apply only to the qualifying items described in each promo code offer. Promo code offers will not be valid until applied to a qualifying item in your cart and promo code discounts will not apply until your order is complete. Each promo code is limited to one use per User and may not be combined with any other promotions. Jackpocket has no obligation for payment of any tax in conjunction with the distribution or use of any promo code, and Users are required to pay any applicable sales tax related to the use of any promo code. Jackpocket, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to accept, refuse, limit, modify or cancel any promo code at any time for any reason without prior notice to you. Promo codes are void where prohibited by law and only good while supplies last.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>4. Referral Program</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackpocket implements referral programs from time to time, where Users can refer new Users in exchange for Non-Withdrawable Credits. Any User that is referred must be a real and unique person who consents to such referral and uniquely opens their account and cannot have previously used the Application. Any such new User must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in these Terms of Service and must not have had an Account suspended or terminated by Jackpocket. Any attempt by a User to use the referral program for fraud or other misuse is subject to suspension or termination and shall not have any right to receive Non-Withdrawable Credits for such referrals. For more information about the referral program, please refer to the page entitled <a href="https://support.jackpocket.com/hc/en-us">https://jackpocket.com/faq</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>5. Order of Tickets</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">If a User makes a new order for Tickets, Jackpocket will first apply any Non-Withdrawable Credits to the cost of the order. Next it will use Withdrawable Credits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>6. Refunds and Cancellations</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">All sales of single-play Tickets and Autoplay Tickets through the Application are final and are ineligible for refund or cancellation at any time. Jackpocket is expressly not responsible for any refunds on any orders placed from your Account, including but not limited to any orders you may claim were placed inadvertently or by mistake/accident. Please review your orders before you place them. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your Tickets may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future Ticket orders made with those credit card or bank accounts and/or via any Account associated with those credit card or bank accounts, and your account is subject to suspension and/or cancellation. We may also prohibit you from using the Application for a period of time. Users of Accounts for which suspension escalates to account cancellation may be subject to forfeiture of prizes awarded for Winning Tickets to the appropriate Regulator and may be permanently prohibited from using this Application in any capacity. All remaining unplayed Jackpocket Credits will be forfeited to Jackpocket upon account cancellation. You shall have no recourse and Jackpocket shall have no liability as a result of any such cancellation. In the event of any Account suspension or cancellation, all provisions of these Terms of Service relating to User warranties, confidentiality obligations, proprietary rights, and limitation of liability shall remain effective despite such suspension or cancellation. For specific suspension or cancellation questions, please email to <a href="mailto:support@Jackpocket.com">support@Jackpocket.com</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Withdrawable Credits may be withdrawn from an Account at any time. Withdrawable Credits can be withdrawn to a bank account and will usually take 3-5 business days to complete but may take longer due to unusual circumstances. If you do not receive your funds within 5 business days of your withdrawal request, please submit a claim to <a href="mailto:support@Jackpocket.com">support@Jackpocket.com</a> for additional assistance. In the event of the death of a Jackpocket User, all available Withdrawable Credits will be paid in accordance with these Terms of Service, to the Executor or similarly functioning representative under his/her last will and testament or, if there is no will, in accordance with the laws of the state of his/her legal residence. Jackpocket may, in its sole discretion, require proof and documentation to establish that the User is deceased and the individual or entity claiming the Withdrawable Credits is entitled to them before paying such Withdrawable Credits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>7. Chargebacks/Insufficient Fund Charges</strong></p>

Additionally, Jackpocket may charge you a fee in the event Jackpocket incurs any such bank or legal fees. You will be notified by e-mail of any chargebacks or fees and we may deduct same from your Account if your Account has sufficient Withdrawable Credits to cover these charges. If it does not, we will not allow further orders until these charges are paid with a valid form of payment. In Jackpocket's discretion, we may suspend or terminate your Account for overcharges or insufficient fund charges or notifications. Additionally, Jackpocket may withhold any present or future Withdrawable Credits in the event Jackpocket incurs any bank or legal fees associated with disputed charges and chargebacks or insufficient funds related to your Account.</p>

Jackpocket is a software developer that provides downloadable mobile applications to Users. Via the Application, Users can order new Tickets from the retailer, determine whether their Tickets qualify for dollar winnings, view their dollar winnings, and use Jackpocket Credits to order new tickets. Jackpocket has an agreement with the retailer granting Jackpocket the right to act as the retailer's agent for payment of debts owed to the retailer by players playing the Lottery through purchases of Tickets offered by the retailer.</p>

<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">When ordering a Ticket through Jackpocket, you are placing an order for a Ticket and not purchasing a Ticket directly.

<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Jackpocket will order your Ticket(s) from a licensed Lottery retailer in time for the Designated Drawing and will upload an image of your Ticket(s) to your Account. We abide by all state regulations to ensure that your request will be processed in time. No customer request for courier service and no receipt or acknowledgment of any such request constitutes evidence of a validly issued Ticket. A Ticket, in order to be a validly issued Ticket, shall be generated by a Lottery terminal authorized by the applicable Regulator. A Ticket is not deemed validly issued when a request for order is made of a courier service, when such a request is acknowledged or when a courier customer makes a payment to a courier service. If there is anything incorrect with your Tickets please email us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@jackpocket.com">support@jackpocket.com</a>. <strong>We will do our best to resolve your issue. Our mode of resolution is in Jackpocket's sole discretion. We will only refund the cost of the ticket in the event the error is caused by Jackpocket</strong>.</p>

Please be warned that ordering New Jersey Lottery tickets through a courier service not licensed by the New Jersey Lottery may expose you to fraud or other illegal activity.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">Although Jackpocket is licensed by the New Jersey Lottery, it is a separate legal entity and is not a part of the New Jersey Lottery, and the New Jersey Lottery does not guarantee, nor have any liability, for courier customer activities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr"><strong>Avoid Lottery Scams</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">This is a warning to all consumers about scammers who are sending false announcements regarding lottery prizes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">As part of the scam, an individual is contacted by phone, email, text message, or a letter from a scammer who is claiming that the recipient has won a prize with a state lottery. Unless you hear from Jackpocket directly, this is a fraudulent claim and there is no such prize. Federal law prohibits the sale or mailing of lottery tickets across state lines. You may only order lottery tickets or set up a subscription in the state you are physically located. Never respond to these communications and never provide information or send money to a scammer.</p>

<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Although Jackpocket has your contact information and knows that you have won, the New Jersey Lottery does NOT know who the winners are until they come forward with a winning ticket.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr">k.<strong> New York Lottery</strong>: For those New York residents/visitors ordering tickets for the New York Lottery games, we are required to disclose the following terms of service to you prior to the creation of an Account and before the placement of any order:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Receipt is not a Ticket</span>. No interactive customer order constitutes evidence of a validly issued lottery ticket. A ticket, in order to be a validly issued ticket, shall be generated as set forth in 9 § 5004.9(a), (d),(p).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ticket Issuance</span>. A draw game ticket is deemed validly issued at the time such ticket is generated by a lottery terminal authorized by the commission or when a registered ticketless transaction is affected and not when a request for order is made of a digital courier service or a ticket order is placed with an interactive sales agent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bet Ticket Responsibility</span>. Lottery tickets are bearer instruments. As such, the New York State Gaming Commission shall not be responsible for: (i) lost or stolen bet tickets; (ii) bet tickets claimed by a customer in error for a lower prize at a lottery sales agent; (iii) bet tickets that are not intact; (iv) bet tickets that are mutilated, altered, reconstituted, counterfeit in whole or in part, or tampered with in any manner, or mis-cut; or (v) bet tickets that have not been issued in an authorized manner, or are mis-registered, defective, or printed or produced in error.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr">By creating an account using the digital network of an interactive sales agent or of a digital courier service to place an order for lottery tickets, an interactive customer agrees:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1) to be bound by the commission's regulations;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">2) to release and hold harmless the interactive sales agent or digital courier service licensee, the State, and the commission from any liability related to an order for tickets placed through the digital network that is not completed before the drawing cutoff and never results in the generation of the tickets ordered through the digital network; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3) that, in the event a dispute occurs as to whether a ticket generated to complete an order placed through a digital network would have been a winning ticket had the ticket purchase occurred and no prize is paid, the commission may, at the commission's option, replace the ticket with a ticket equal in value to the price paid for the ticket that is the subject of the dispute, which remedy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the claimant against the commission</p>

<p dir="ltr">In connection with a Ticket redemption, Jackpocket transmits winnings to the User. You consent to Jackpocket storing any Ticket on your behalf.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once the drawing and prize results are in, Jackpocket will notify you in the Application and email you to let you know if your Ticket is a Winning Ticket. If it is a Winning Ticket and the prize value is less than or equal to the In-Store Redemption Threshold, Jackpocket will automatically credit your Account for the full prize value, as further described in Section (1) below. If a Winning Ticket has a prize value worth more than the In-Store Redemption Threshold, Jackpocket will arrange for delivery or pickup of the Winning Ticket to the User or to the Regulator, as further described in Section (2) below.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prize claims made through this Application are subject to the prize payout rules and regulations set forth by the Regulator. Jackpocket may provide the Regulator with any User Personal Information as requested by the Regulator, including to process prize claims. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the full name, address and phone number listed in your Account.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>1. Winning Tickets with prizes totaling less than or equal to the In-store Redemption Threshold.</strong> By using the Application you authorize Jackpocket to store and claim Winning Tickets with prize totals that are less than or equal to the In-Store Redemption Threshold in the Jurisdiction of purchase on your behalf at an authorized lottery retailer as soon as drawing results are posted. <strong>Neither Jackpocket nor the authorized retailers from which Jackpocket collects these prizes will withhold any applicable taxes on your behalf</strong>. Jackpocket will deposit the full prize value into your Jackpocket account in the form of Withdrawable Credits. These Withdrawable Credits may be converted to U.S. dollars and transferred to an eligible checking or savings account in accordance with these Terms of Service. Users may also keep the Withdrawable Credits and use them towards future orders.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">For New Jersey Customers, if you desire to opt-out of authorizing Jackpocket to claim these types of Winning Tickets, you can do so by contacting <a href="mailto:support@jackpocket.com">support@jackpocket.com</a>, specifying whether you want the Winning Tickets to be delivered (a) via a nationally recognized courier or mail service at Jackpocket’s expense, or (b) by hand at our processing location.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">For non-New York customers, if the official prize for the Winning Ticket is a free Ticket for a separate drawing, then Jackpocket may either provide the User with the new Ticket OR credit the User with a Non-Withdrawable Credit equal to the purchase value that the new Ticket would cost if purchased.&nbsp; For New York customers, if the official prize for the Winning Ticket is a free Ticket for a separate drawing, then Jackpocket will provide the User with the new Ticket.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr"><strong>You are ultimately responsible for paying any tax liability associated with claims made through this Application for Winning Tickets with prizes that are less than or equal to the In-Store Redemption Threshold in the state of purchase</strong>. The In-Store Redemption Threshold varies by Jurisdiction, but is typically around $600. Check your Regulator's official website for more information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">Payouts for these prizes will be facilitated via Dwolla and will require the User to cooperate with all necessary Know Your Customer ("KYC") regulatory requirements.

Claims for Winning Tickets with prizes totaling more than the In-Store Redemption Threshold and up to $10,000 will, at your option, be delivered (a) via a nationally recognized courier or mail service at Jackpocket’s expense, or (b) by hand at our processing location. For non-New York customers claiming Winning Tickets worth more than $10,000, the customer will be required to pick up the ticket in person, subject to the in-person requirements set forth in the next paragraph. For New York customers claiming Winning Tickets worth more than $10,000, the customer will still have the option for hand delivery or a nationally recognized courier or mail service. If permitted in your jurisdiction, you agree to allow Jackpocket to send your Winning Ticket, including any required claim information, directly to the Regulator, allowing you to receive a check or other form or method of payment from such Regulator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">JACKPOCKET STRONGLY RECOMMENDS TO NEW YORK WINNERS THAT THEY REQUEST HAND DELIVERY IN PERSON AT THE JACKPOCKET PROCESSING CENTER OF A WINNING TICKET WORTH MORE THAN $10,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">IN THE EVENT YOU ELECT TO RECEIVE DELIVERY VIA A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COURIER OR MAIL SERVICE, JACKPOCKET SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR LACK OF DELIVERY, INCORRECT DELIVERY OR MISPLACEMENT OF ANY WINNING TICKET, ONCE SUCH TICKETS ARE PROVIDED BY JACKPOCKET TO THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COURIER OR MAIL SERVICE. ANY AMOUNT PAID BY JACKPOCKET IN RELATION TO ANY SUCH WINNING TICKET SHALL NOT BE: (I) AN ADMISSION OF LIABILITY, (II) A REQUIREMENT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS, OR (III) CONSIDERED A WAIVER OF ANY OF JACKPOCKET’S RIGHTS IN THIS TERMS OF SERVICE.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">Winning Tickets greater than the In-Store Redemption Threshold are subject to approval by the Regulator and must be claimed directly from the Regulator either by mail or in person. Claiming rules vary by Jurisdiction. Check your Jurisdiction for more details. The Regulator may withhold taxes from prize distributions for Winning Tickets with claimed prizes totaling more than the In-Store Redemption Threshold. Jackpocket will not be liable for verifying the appropriateness or accuracy of taxes withheld from Users' claims, and Users are solely responsible for handling individual tax situations directly with the applicable Jurisdiction. Jackpocket will not be liable for any unclaimed prizes associated with Winning Tickets ordered through this Application for any reason. You authorize Jackpocket to store any such Winning Tickets until delivery or pick up, as applicable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">Jackpocket requires, and you agree to present a government-issued identification in order to pick up any Winning Ticket associated with your Account.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">In the event that Jackpocket mails you the Winning Ticket, Jackpocket will be responsible for paying for the shipping costs and Jackpocket is released from any liability and responsibility as soon as the packaged Winning Ticket is put into the possession of the mail courier. Prior to or upon shipping, Jackpocket will provide you with an email containing the tracking information for your Winning Ticket. <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">In the event </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">you do not receive your Winning Ticket, you </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">must notify Jackpocket within fifteen (15) </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">days following receipt of the email contai</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">ning the tracking information so that </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Jackpocket may notify the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">courier or mail service. </span>You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your mailing address.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;" dir="ltr">For winning and claiming of Pool Tickets ordered as part of a Lottery Pool, see Section 9 below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" role="presentation" dir="ltr"><strong>3. Prohibition on Claiming Winning Tickets.</strong> You are prohibited from claiming, or attempting to claim, any Winning Tickets in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Section 8. In the event you claim, or attempt to claim, any Winning Ticket in a manner that is inconsistent with this Section, you agree that Jackpocket will have no liability to you with respect to such Winning Ticket, including, without limitation, the obligation to deposit any Withdrawable Credits into your Account associated with such Winning Ticket. Additionally, in the event that you and Jackpocket both claim the prize for any Winning Ticket, Jackpocket has the right to immediately remove any associated Withdrawable Credits from your Account and suspend or terminate your Account. You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Jackpocket for any claims, losses, expenses and all other liabilities Jackpocket incurs as a result of your failure to comply with these Terms of Service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument.</strong> Note that your ticket is held in trust by courier and ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your winning ticket, do not lose your ticket or allow others to possess your ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer’s name on the back of the ticket following the ticket being deemed a winning ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer’s possession.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="[&amp;_a]:font-semibold [&amp;_a]:text-primary [&amp;_ul]:mb-4 [&amp;_ul]:ml-5 [&amp;_ul]:list-disc [&amp;_h1]:mb-[16px] [&amp;_h1]:font-primary [&amp;_h1]:text-[36px] [&amp;_h1]:leading-[43px] [&amp;_h1]:md:text-[42px] [&amp;_h1]:md:leading-[50px] [&amp;_p]:mb-4 [&amp;_p]:text-[16px] [&amp;_p]:leading-[22px] [&amp;_th]:border [&amp;_th]:border-dark [&amp;_tr]:border [&amp;_tr]:border-dark [&amp;_td]:border [&amp;_td]:border-dark [&amp;_td]:text-[16px] [&amp;_td]:leading-[24px] tos m-auto w-full max-w-[600px] px-5"><p dir="ltr"><strong>9.

<p dir="ltr">Users may elect to utilize this Application to generate and/or order pseudo-random plays.

Solely with regard to scratch off orders, to the extent there is any contradiction between the terms of this Section 12 and the terms of the remainder of this Terms of Service, the terms of this Section 12 shall prevail.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have your scratch off tickets physically delivered to your location or delivered to you within the Application.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For physical delivery, you agree that you are ordering the scratch off tickets at cost through Jackpocket and that the mailing of the tickets is a separate transaction, which includes a separate shipping fee to be charged to your account. All scratch off tickets are purchased through a licensed retailer at the actual cost of the tickets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Upon placing an order for scratch off tickets, you will receive an email from Jackpocket confirming the order.

</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Let's Try to Work Things Out. We want to address your concerns without litigation. Before filing a claim against Jackpocket, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@jackpocket.com">support@jackpocket.com</a>. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 45 days of submission, you or Jackpocket may bring a formal arbitration proceeding as described below.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">We Both Agree to Arbitrate. You and Jackpocket agree to resolve through final and binding arbitration any claims relating to these Terms of Service, the Application, and any Tickets, prizes or other services offered on or through the Application, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. The arbitration shall be held in the state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in New York, New York, and you and Jackpocket agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any or state or federal court in New York, New York to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the aware entered by the arbitrator.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by sending a letter to Jackpocket that must be postmarked within 30 days of your first acceptance of these Terms of Service. The letter must specify your first and last names, Account ID, mailing address, and explain that you are opting out of this arbitration provision. The letter should be sent to Jackpocket Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 100 Park Ave, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10017</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5276 (referred to as the "JAMS Rules") and under the rules set forth in these Terms of Service. We may also mutually agree to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based on written submissions.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Arbitration and Attorney's Fees. Jackpocket will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $25,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless Jackpocket is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $25,000, the JAMS Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Jackpocket and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Jackpocket and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jackpocket and you agree not to seek any attorneys' fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose. Jackpocket and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Jackpocket and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Jackpocket and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If Jackpocket is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to Jackpocket.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Jackpocket agree that in the event that there are twenty-five (25) or more individual claims of a substantially similar nature filed against Jackpocket by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 claims per batch (or, if between twenty-five (25) and ninety-nine (99) individual claims are filed, a single batch of all those claims, and, to the extent there are less than 100 claims remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). All parties agree that claims are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Jackpocket. You and Jackpocket agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of claims, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.&nbsp; This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Severability; Waiver of Jury Trial. If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect. In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, Jackpocket and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury. The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of Jackpocket to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Application, and/or the provision of services and/or technology on or through the Application.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Jackpocket may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, New York, provided the informal dispute resolution described above was unsuccessful. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Jackpocket is committed to ensuring the lottery does not turn from a game of fun into a financial issue. Jackpocket warns that for some users, gambling of any kind can be a problem and therefore, we offer the following tools and resources to encourage healthy playing behavior.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Set User Limits</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackpocket enforces spending and funding limits in order to protect users from abusive play. You have the option to lower these limits. Once you set a new limit, it cannot be edited for seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Exclusion</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you wish to exclude yourself from play, you may apply a self-exclusion to your account at any time. A self-exclusion will suspend you from playing on Jackpocket for a specified period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">You decide how long to apply the self-exclusion.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">We ensure you are no longer able to buy more credits or make plays during this specified period.</p>

<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Any winnings from outstanding orders will be given to you.</p>

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5276 (referred to as the \"JAMS Rules\") and under the rules set forth in these Terms of Service. We may also mutually agree to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based on written submissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n\u003cp role=\"presentation\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eArbitration and Attorney's Fees. Jackpocket will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $25,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless Jackpocket is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $25,000, the JAMS Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Jackpocket and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Jackpocket and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jackpocket and you agree not to seek any attorneys' fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose. Jackpocket and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Jackpocket and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Jackpocket and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If Jackpocket is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to Jackpocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBatch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Jackpocket agree that in the event that there are twenty-five (25) or more individual claims of a substantially similar nature filed against Jackpocket by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 claims per batch (or, if between twenty-five (25) and ninety-nine (99) individual claims are filed, a single batch of all those claims, and, to the extent there are less than 100 claims remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). All parties agree that claims are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Jackpocket. You and Jackpocket agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of claims, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.\u0026nbsp; This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n\u003cp role=\"presentation\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSeverability; Waiver of Jury Trial.

In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, Jackpocket and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury. The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of Jackpocket to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Application, and/or the provision of services and/or technology on or through the Application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n\u003cp role=\"presentation\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
