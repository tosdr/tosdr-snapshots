<h3>Colorado residents' privacy rights</h3>
<p>As a Colorado resident, you may exercise the rights listed below using our online webform to authenticate and submit your request at:&nbsp;<a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/048df61e-d7fa-4291-a10d-715edb5fcb76/6df02ee3-20aa-48da-b971-5654d25c8d38">CPA Online Webform</a>. The link will take you to an interactive webform that you can complete and submit to make a request. We will then use the information in the webform, and potentially additional information that we request from you, to verify your identity. These rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request for reasons permitted by law, including our inability to verify your identity. If we deny your request, we will tell you why we did so. If we deny you request or you are otherwise unsatisfied with our response to your request, you can exercise your right to appeal through the webform. We will never discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. If you have any questions about submitting requests to exercise your rights, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@jackpocket.com">support@jackpocket.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Right to opt-out</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You, or an authorized agent using the webform on your behalf, can opt out of the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data or for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer (as such terms are defined in the CPA).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We do not engage in any such processing of personal data. Therefore, there is no processing from which to opt-out, though the webform does still give you the ability to opt-out of such processing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should we ever begin processing your personal data for any of the above-listed reasons from which you have a right to opt-out, we will seek your consent before doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Right of access and to data portability</strong></p>
<p>You can ask us for confirmation whether we are processing your personal data and to access any such personal data. When exercising your right to access your personal data, you also have the right to obtain such personal data in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible and to the extent disclosing such personal data does not disclose any of our trade secrets, readily usable format. You may only exercise this right to data portability two times per calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Right to correction</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You can ask us to correct inaccuracies in your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Right to deletion</strong></p>
<p>You can ask us to delete the personal data of yours that we have.</p>
<h3>California residents&rsquo; privacy rights</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Right to request the deletion of personal information</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You can ask us to delete the personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. We will also notify any service providers and third parties with whom we have shared your personal information of your request. If you are using Paysafe with our Services, and you desire to have your personal information deleted from Paysafe, you must contact Paysafe directly to make such a request. Please note that due to applicable laws and regulations, you will be unable to use some of our Services if your personal information is deleted, including, but not limited to, ordering lottery tickets or playing casino games. As noted above, your deletion request is subject to certain exceptions which we may rely on where it is necessary for us to:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between you and us;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to ask us not to sell your personal information</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell your personal information. However, like many companies, we may use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies about your online activity. This is called interest-based advertising. The CCPA&rsquo;s statutory definition of the term &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is broad and may include interest-based advertising. You can get more information and opt-out of the use of cookies on our Services for interest-based advertising purposes by setting your preferences on the Apps or our Websites. You will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt-out. This feature may use a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you may need to re-set your settings.</p>
<p><strong>Right to nondiscrimination</strong></p>
<p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by the CCPA.</p>
<p><strong>How to exercise your rights</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You may submit requests to exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em><strong>Right to request the access and deletion of your personal information</strong></em>.&nbsp;If you are a California resident, you may submit a request to exercise the access and deletion rights of your personal information over the past 12 months by using our online webform to validate and submit your request at:&nbsp;<a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/048df61e-d7fa-4291-a10d-715edb5fcb76/e03d430c-5779-4f72-9fcd-f4d82785861a">CCPA Online Webform</a>.&nbsp; You may also exercise these access and deletion rights by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacyrequests@jackpocket.com">privacyrequests@jackpocket.com</a>. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice in a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. <span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law. We will need to verify your identity to process your access and deletion rights and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into your Jackpocket account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent&rsquo;s identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>
<p><strong>Shine the Light</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding Jackpocket&rsquo;s disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident&rsquo;s personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties&rsquo; and affiliates&rsquo; direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. We do not currently share personal information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties&rsquo; or affiliates&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. However, if we do so in the future, we intend to provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out at the time Jackpocket offers that choice, Jackpocket will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address:&nbsp;privacyrequests@jackpocket.com.&nbsp; You must put the statement &ldquo;Your California Privacy Rights&rdquo; in the subject field of your e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>How we respond to Do Not Track signals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how companies respond to "Do Not Track" browser settings. Jackpocket does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
<h3>Children Under the Age of 13</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on or through our Services. If it is discovered that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13, this information will be deleted. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at&nbsp;privacyrequests@jackpocket.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Transactions through our Services are limited to those meeting the age requirements in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The security of your personal information is extremely important. We maintain commercially reasonable technical, administrative, physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information provided to us, including encryption of your social security number, passwords and Payment Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, no communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Although we take care to protect your personal information, including a secure method of transfer for communications containing your Account Data or account number and robust encryption for all other communications, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide to us, so you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h3>Your Responsibilities&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The security of your information and account with us is also dependent on you. Please keep any account information, including access to your computer or mobile device secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, accuracy and completeness of your account information. We also recommend that you log out of your account when you are done using our Services, to help prevent another party from accessing your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, you must notify us immediately at&nbsp;privacyrequests@jackpocket.com.</p>
<h3>Changes and Updates</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy may be periodically revised, and this will be reflected by the &ldquo;Last update&rdquo; date at the top. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. If a revision to this Privacy Policy, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you by contacting you through the email address associated with your account and/or we may provide notice to you within the app itself where we may require you to acknowledge such changes. For non-material changes, where your acknowledgement is not required, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the Policy as amended. Each time you use the Services, the version of our Privacy Policy then posted will apply to that use, so it is your responsibility to check for updates each time you access the Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
