<p>These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”) are entered into between illumin, an Ontario corporation with offices at 70 University Ave, Suite 1200 Toronto, ON M5J 2M4 Canada and the entity specified in the applicable Insertion Order (the “IO”, and together with the Terms and Conditions, the “Agreement”) with offices at the address specified in the IO. illumin reserves the right to update and change these Terms and Conditions from time to time without notice to Advertiser.</p>
<h4>1. Definitions</h4>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:</p>
<p>1.1 “Ad” means any advertisement (including, without limitation, all logos, trademarks, creative materials, graphic images and copy therein) provided to illumin, directly or indirectly, by Advertiser, including without limitation banner advertisements, text advertisements and video advertisements (as such terms are understood in the online advertising industry) and advertisements received from Contracted Clients.</p>
<p>1.2 “Ad Exchange” shall mean any exchange where Ad Inventory can be purchased can be purchased through an Auction.</p>
<p>1.3 “Ad Inventory” shall mean any digital advertising inventory made available for sale through an Ad Exchange, including, but not limited to, web display, mobile, application and/or widget-based advertising inventory.</p>
<p>1.4 “Advertiser” shall mean the Advertiser set forth in the IO and shall, for purposes of Advertiser’s obligations under these Terms and Conditions, include any Contracted Client. The obligations of Advertiser and a Contracted Client under this Agreement shall be joint and several.</p>
<p>1.5 “Auction” means the real-time bidding process for Ad Inventory offered through Ad Exchanges.</p>
<p>1.6 “Campaign” means the advertisement campaign to be operated by Advertiser through the Platform.</p>
<p>1.7 “Platform” means the advertising machine learning advertising platform developed and owned by illumin.<br />
For clarity, all capitalized terms used in these Terms and Conditions but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the IO.</p>
<h4>2. License</h4>
<p>2.1 illumin hereby grants to Advertiser a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for purposes of conducting Campaigns during the Term in accordance with this Agreement. As between Advertiser and illumin, Advertiser acknowledges that illumin is the owner of all intellectual property rights in and to the Platform including all content thereon (other than the Ads) and, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, Advertiser shall not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing that will in any way impair the rights of illumin in and to the Platform. Nothing in this Agreement grants, nor shall Advertiser acquire hereby, any right, title or interest in or to the Platform or any goodwill associated with the Platform, other than those rights expressly granted hereunder. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights in the Platform granted to Advertiser hereunder shall automatically revert to illumin, and Advertiser shall have no further rights in the Platform.</p>
<p>2.2 illumin will provide Platform and sales training as well as support over the phone and WebEx as needed by Advertiser. An aggregate of thirty (30) hours of such training and support will be provided to Advertiser during any twelve consecutive months at no additional charge. If Advertiser requests more than 30 hours of training and support, Advertiser will pay illumin for consulting services at a rate of one-hundred dollars ($100) net per hour. If Advertiser requests in person training, Advertiser will reimburse illumin for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.</p>
<p>2.3 Advertiser’s use of the Platform shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances as well as any written policies or procedures that illumin may provide to Advertiser from time to time in connection with Advertiser’s use of the Platform. illumin reserves the right to monitor the Platform and Advertiser’s use of the Platform from time to time in its sole discretion.</p>
<h4>3. Sales agency</h4>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, illumin hereby grants Advertiser the limited, non-transferrable right (the “Selling Rights”) to act as the sales representative for the Platform (the “Sales Agency Services”) and to provide advertising services to third parties through the Platform (“Advertiser Services”). Exercise of these rights entitle Advertiser:</p>
<p>3.1 to advertise the existence of the Platform and the Advertiser Services;</p>
<p>3.2 to enter into and execute agreements (in such form as illumin may approve from time to time) in respect of the Advertiser Services (the “Advertiser Agreements”). For purposes of this Agreement, upon entering into an Advertiser Agreement, a third party shall be a “Contracted Client”;</p>
<p>3.3 to process all payments from Contracted Clients received in connection with the Advertiser Services (the “Payment Processing”);</p>
<p>3.4 to carry out such other duties and obligations as are specifically authorized by this Agreement.</p>
<p>Exercise of the Selling Rights shall be at Advertiser’s sole cost and expense and shall require Advertiser to provide to illumin such content and information about the Contracted Client and the Advertiser Services to be provided to such Contracted Client, as illumin may request.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, Advertiser shall not permit any Contracted Client to directly use or access the Platform without the written consent of illumin. Rather, Advertiser shall only have the right to use the Platform on behalf of, and for the Contracted Client’s benefit.</p>
<p>Advertiser shall submit to illumin for review any and all advertisements and/or marketing materials (collectively, “Marketing Materials”) to be used by Advertiser in connection with the Sales Agency Services and Advertiser Services. illumin shall have the right to approve or reject the Marketing Materials in its sole discretion. Advertiser shall not make any representations, warranties, statements or claims about the Platform, except as approved by illumin in its sole discretion.</p>
<h4>4. Obligations of parties</h4>
<p>Advertiser hereby grants to illumin a worldwide, royalty free, sub-licensable, non-exclusive right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, publicly and digitally display and perform, transmit and broadcast (collectively, “Use”) the Ads (and any trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, URLs or other proprietary rights of Advertiser therein) in connection with the Campaign.</p>
<p>Advertiser represents and warrants to illumin that each Ad (and any and all content therein) and the distribution thereof in accordance with this Agreement:</p>
<p>4.1 complies, as applicable, with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less (US), and/or the IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less and Late Creative Policy (Canada);</p>
<p>4.2 does not infringe the patents, copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, rights of privacy, moral rights, music performance or other music-related rights, or any other right of any third party;</p>
<p>4.3 does not violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation regarding the creation and marketing of online materials including, without limitation, those governing false and/or deceptive advertising;</p>
<p>4.4 is true, accurate and complete;</p>
<p>4.5 is not unlawful, defamatory or libelous;</p>
<p>4.6 is not pornographic or obscene; and</p>
<p>4.7 does not contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines.</p>
<p>4.8 Advertiser further represents and warrants that:</p>
<p>4.8.1 Prior to delivery to illumin, Advertiser will have obtained all consents, releases, waivers and rights (including, without limitation, all rights in copyright, moral rights, trade-mark and trade name rights and other intellectual property rights) necessary for the grant to illumin, and exploitation by illumin, of the rights and licenses granted to illumin in the Ads pursuant to this Agreement; illumin reserves, in its sole discretion, the right (but not the obligation) to: (i) review any Ads used by Advertiser through the Platform prior to Use; and/or (ii) to reject or refuse to serve any Ad that is, in its sole discretion, objectionable or which may expose illumin, its suppliers and each of their affiliates, or its other clients to any harm or liability of any type.</p>
<p>4.8.2 Advertiser has paid, or will have paid prior to use thereof, to the proper person, firm or corporation when due and payable, all residual, re-use or similar payments, all step-up fees, all music synchronization fees or royalties, all mechanical reproduction fees or royalties, all performance rights fees or royalties and all license payments and all other amounts payable to third parties as a result of, or in connection with, the Use of the Ads hereunder.</p>
<p>4.8.3 Advertiser represents and warrants that it is in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAA OBA Principles”) and the Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAAC OBA Principles”), including the provision of appropriate notice and choice of online behavioral advertising. Advertiser represents and warrants that any websites where data is collected for online behavioral advertising provides users notice that third parties will collect data for purposes of serving targeted ads and provide a link to a means by which users may opt out of such targeted ads, such as www.aboutads.info or www.youradchoices.ca. For Advertiser’s convenience, we offer the following sample privacy disclosure, but strongly encourage Advertiser to work with counsel to ensure that these disclosures accurately represent Advertiser’s practices as legal requirements may change and/or be subject to differing legal interpretations: “We use a third-party service provider to serve ads and/or collect data on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website.  They may collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services to tailor advertising messages on this website and other sites.  The information collected by these third-parties may include your devices IP address, user agent and other device level pseudonymous information. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to understand your choices about how to control how this information is used, please click here.”</p>
<p>4.9 illumin represents that in providing the Services, it shall adhere to applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable privacy law and Data Protection Laws and that the Platform shall operate as described in illumin’s privacy policy located <a href="https://illumin.com/legal/corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, illumin reserves the right to run campaigns on the platform of its choosing at its sole discretion.</p>
<h4>5. Billing type</h4>
<p>Advertiser agrees that it shall pay to illumin all amounts owing to illumin in accordance with the Billing Type selected by Advertiser in the Platform for a Campaign, and subject to the Monthly Minimum Commitment (as set forth in the IO), if any. For purposes of this Agreement:</p>
<p>“Dynamic Campaign” means that illumin will invoice Advertiser on a monthly basis for all Ad Inventory purchased by Advertiser pursuant to a Campaign, plus a percentage as set forth in the Platform.</p>
<p>“Fixed CPM Campaign” – means that illumin will invoice Advertiser on a monthly basis for the total number of impressions (per thousand) delivered pursuant to a Campaign at the rate for such impressions set forth by the Advertiser on the Platform.</p>
<h4>6. Payment</h4>

<li>9.1 illumin may, subject to this Section 9, store and process the relevant Personal Data in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.</li>
<li>9.2 Given that the Services involve the storage and/or Processing of Personal Data which transfers such Personal Data out of the European Economic Area or Switzerland to a jurisdiction that does not have adequate Data Protection Laws, and the Data Protection Laws apply to the transfers of such data (“Transferred Personal Data”), the parties agree that the EU Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 and available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj (as amended or updated from time to time) (“Standard Contractual Clauses”) will apply and such Standard Contractual Clauses shall be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this DPA. Purely for the purposes of the descriptions in the Standard Contractual Clauses and only as between Buyer and illumin, the parties agree that: (a) Roles: the parties agree that illumin is a “data importer” and Buyer is the “data exporter” under the Standard Contractual Clauses. (b) Governing Law and Supervisory Authority: The Standard Contractual Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established and enforced by the Supervisory Authority of such EU Member State; (c) Sub-Processors: the parties select general written authorization for Sub-processors; (d) Redress: The parties elect to omit the optional text; and (e) Annex I, II and III are provided at the end of this DPA as Appendix A and to the extent that there’s a conflict as between the DPA and the Appendix A, the Appendix A shall govern.</li>
<li>9.3  The parties further agree that if Transferred Personal Data includes UK Personal Data, and the Data Protection Laws apply to the transfers of such data, both parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers reflecting the roles of the parties as described in the DPA in the form approved by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office and currently available at https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/4019483/international-data-transfer-addendum.pdf (as amended or updated from time to time) (“UK Standard Contractual Clauses”) shall be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this DPA. For the purposes of the UK Standard Contractual Clauses, Appendix A of these Terms shall take the place of Annex 1, Annex II and Annex III respectively of the UK Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
<li>9.4  If the Standard Contractual Clauses or any other model clause transfer agreement are deemed invalid by a governmental entity with jurisdiction over Transferred Personal Data (e.g., the EU Court of Justice) or if such governmental entity imposes additional rules and/or restrictions regarding such Transferred Personal Data, the parties agree to work in good faith to find an alternative and/or modified transfer mechanism.</li>
<li>9.5 To the extent Buyer is the recipient of Transferred Personal Data from illumin as part of the Services, Buyer will provide at least the same level of protection for the information as is available under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>10. Liability</h4>
<ul>
<li>10.1 Both parties agree that their respective liability under this DPA shall be apportioned according to each parties’ respective responsibility for the harm (if any) caused by each respective party.</li>
<li>10.2 Liability Cap Exclusions. Nothing in this Section 10 will affect the remaining terms of the Agreement relating to liability (including any specific exclusions from any limitation of liability).</li>
</ul>
<h4>11. Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
<li>11.1 This DPA will take effect on the date it is executed by Buyer and illumin at the bottom of this Agreement (the “Effective Date”) and will remain in effect until, and automatically expire upon, the deletion of all Personal Data by illumin or Buyer through the Services as described in this DPA.</li>
<li>11.2 Nothing in this DPA shall impact Buyer’s intellectual property rights with respect to Personal Data provided by Buyer under the Agreement except to the extent required by applicable law.</li>
<li>11.3 Nothing in this DPA shall confer any benefits or rights on any person or entity other than the parties to this DPA.</li>
<li>11.4 This DPA may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed shall constitute a duplicate original, but all the counterparts shall together constitute the one Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annex 2 Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter in accordance with Clauses 4(d) and 5(c) (or document/legislation)</h4>
<p>Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter</p>
<p>Measures with which Personal Data can be processed while denying physical access to IT systems for unauthorized persons (access control):</p>
<p>All of the data exporter’s third-party data centers have strict policies for authorization of access into the facilities.   Each data center vendor has appropriate policies required by external audits.  All of the data exporter’s internal personnel are vetted prior to allowing access to data centers.</p>
<p>Measures to hinder unauthorized persons from using IT systems and procedures (access control):</p>
<p>All systems level access is based on directory services and role-based security.  Additional measures are in place such as VPN and other security measures prior to system level access being available, as described below.  All end user level access to illumin’s systems is based on role-based security.  Shared accounts are not allowed.</p>
<p>The data exporter undertakes the following actions, among others, to ensure that persons authorized to use the illumin Platform or access data processing infrastructure can only access the data underlying their access authorization and that stored data or data undergoing processing cannot be read, copied, altered, or removed without authorization.</p>
<p>The data exporter’s employees access infrastructure components with unique accounts that require strong passwords.  Remote administration is available only via public key cryptography and password-based authentication is not permitted.  Access groups have been established to restrict access to only to specific areas that are required for employee responsibilities.</p>
<p>Customers of the data exporter may be granted access to the illumin console. Access to the illumin console is limited via a username and a password to the customer’s authorized persons and additionally to equivalently authorized employees of the data exporter.  Logical infrastructure configuration prevents the access of one customer’s data by another customer.</p>
<p>Measures to enable persons authorized to use IT procedures to gain exclusive access to the Personal Data that are subject to their access authorization (access control):</p>
<p>The data exporter employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. The data exporter requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need-to-know basis; and must be in accordance with the data exporter’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.</p>
<p>In addition, the data exporter has implemented several security related policies that govern the use of illumin technology and data including rules around acceptable use, data classification, information security, and passwords.  The data exporter’s information security officer is Rachel Kapcan.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, amended or removed by unauthorized persons when the data is transmitted electronically, or when it is being transported, or when it is being stored on data carriers, but which allow checks to be made of the destinations targeted when transferring Personal Data using data transmission equipment (routing controls):</p>
<p>Data is encrypted by measures such as SSL.  Personal data shall not be transferred outside the scope as authorized under these Clauses, or as otherwise authorized by the data importer.</p>
<p>Measures that allow retrospective checks to be made on whether Personal Data has been entered into, amended or removed from IT systems, and by whom (input controls):</p>
<p>All data processed in illumin Platform by an end user of the platform (e.g., CL personnel) is done on a permissions-based model, all user accounts are enabled/disabled in accordance with the security policy.  All accounts are individual. Shared accounts are not allowed. Audit Trail is kept for user actions and is logged.</p>
<p>Email and corporate systems access is granted based on directory services and role-based security.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure that Personal Data to be processed on CONTROLLER’s behalf is only processed in accordance with CONTROLLER’s directives (performance controls):</p>
<p>The data importer is a user of the illumin Platform, therefore setting up of data collection mechanisms, collection of data, verifying data integrity sit with the data importer. The personal data shall only be processed in the manner authorized under these Clauses and all sub processors shall only be employed in compliance with the provisions of these Clauses.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure that Personal Data is protected against incidental damage or loss (availability controls):</p>
<p>Data is kept in a storage framework with at least three copies natively made and stored. Additionally, the data exporter replicates data between data centers for disaster recovery with ability to restore if needed, although the data exporter will not replicate lat/long or other data points which might be considered sensitive in the EU.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure that the different purposes for processing data can be identified – especially for PROCESSOR’s different controllers – and that data to be processed is processed separately from each other (separation controls):</p>
<p>illumin stores data in a multi-tenant environment on servers owned by illumin. The Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple data centers. illumin logically isolates data on a per end user basis at the application layer. illumin logically separates Customer’s data, including data from different end users, from each other, and data for an authenticated end user will not be displayed to another end user (unless the former end user or administrator allows the data to be shared). A central authentication system is used across all Services to increase uniform security of data.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure availability and resiliency for data and technical operations:</p>
<p>illumin stores data and operates servers in datacenters with robust and redundant power and data storage mechanisms. All deployments are configured with repeatable operating templates, for rapid deployment to a DR region when necessary. All networks are protected by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other industry best practice security measures.</p>
<p>Measures for regular testing, assessment and evaluation:</p>
<p>illumin regularly reviews system activity rated by security threat level by our intrusion detection platform. illumin regularly runs external network scans to ensure operating systems, libraries, and all used software is patched against vulnerabilities. All platform configurations are catalogued within version control and issued via peer-reviewed pull requests to ensure multiple reviewers of each security related change.</p>
<p>Measures for pseudonymization of data:</p>
<p>illumin works with upstream data controllers to ensure no PII enters our system.</p>
<h4>Annex III – Sub-processors</h4>
<p>A list of Sub-processors will be made available by illumin.</p>
