Unless stipulated otherwise, the Usage Rights are limited to the respective Scope of Use designated by the User (cf. Section 2.3.2 below), are granted on a non-exclusive basis, are unlimited in terms of territory, may be transferred or sublicensed by Vorwerk to third parties to the extent necessary to operate Cookidoo® (especially to affiliated companies of Vorwerk), and are free of charge. They are unlimited in terms of time and are thus not terminated together with a termination of the Cookidoo® Subscription, unless stipulated to the contrary hereinafter.</p><p><b>2.3.2</b> Unless stipulated otherwise and within the limits of the respective Scope of Use as defined below, the Usage Rights include in particular the right to reproduce, to distribute, to make publicly available, to broadcast, to edit the Customer Recipe for technical or editorial reasons and to reproduce it by means of visual and audio media. Should new technical possibilities for the use of the Customer Recipes become known, the Usage Rights shall extend to those as well. If the Customer Recipe contains the name or other personal data of the User, the Usage Rights shall also cover these. The scope of Usage Rights relates to the scope of use of the User (in the following “<b>Scope of Use</b>”):<br />(i) When a User adds a Customer Recipe to the Cookidoo® account, the Usage Rights cover the User’s Cookidoo® account to which the Customer Recipe may be stored (reproduced), distributed, made available, broadcast etc. To this extent exclusively, the Usage Rights shall terminate when the Cookidoo® Subscription of the User terminates.<br />(ii) When a User shares a Customer Recipe (Customer Recipe Sharing), the Usage Rights cover also the Cookidoo® accounts of the respective users the Customer Recipe was shared with. Moreover, the User grants the respective other users Usage Rights to the Customer Recipe to the extent set out in Section 1.3 above. The term of these Usage Rights is independent from the Cookidoo® Subscription of the User; thus, Vorwerk may continue to provide access to Customer Recipes to the recipients of such Customer Recipes also after a termination of the User’s Cookidoo® Subscription.<br />(iii) Depending on technical and legal feasibility, when a User publishes a Customer Recipe to all other users on Cookidoo® (Customer Recipe Publishing), Section (ii) applies accordingly, however covering the Cookidoo® accounts of all other existing and future users. In addition, Vorwerk shall be entitled to use such a Customer Recipe for promotion of, and advertising for, Cookidoo® and grant respective licenses to third persons, e.g., advertising agencies, for these purposes.</p><h3 id="tos_p_02_04.00.00">2.4 The User’s Warranty and Liability with Regard to Customer Recipes</h3><p><b>2.4.1</b> The User warrants to have the necessary rights to grant the Usage Rights according to Section 2.3 above and that such grant of rights does neither violate applicable law nor infringe the rights of third parties, especially copyrights.

Vorwerk offers the User to pay by credit or debit card (Mastercard or Visa) or by additional payment methods if listed on Cookidoo®.</p><p><b>3.2.5</b> Vorwerk reserves the right to offer a possibility to pay for subscriptions through prepaid vouchers. Prepaid vouchers are vouchers customers may buy e.g. from Vorwerk or from distributors. Customers may redeem vouchers on the local Cookidoo® website of the country in which they purchased the vouchers. If no local Cookidoo® website exists for that country, customers may redeem the prepaid vouchers on the international Cookidoo® website. The sale of such prepaid vouchers may be subject to terms and conditions of the respective seller.</p><h3 id="tos_p_03_03.00.00">3.3 Provision of the Services</h3><p><b>3.3.1</b> In case of a Paid Subscription, the Cookidoo® Subscription will be activated after payment by the User.

In the event of a conflict between the additional conditions and these Terms of Use, the additional conditions shall prevail.</p><p><b>3.3.4</b> For certain Cookidoo® features, Vorwerk relies on specific partners and third-party providers (“<b>Partners</b>”). Thus, Vorwerk cannot provide these features without the respective Partner. This may lead to Vorwerk being unable to provide the respective features, if a Partner’s services are not available<br />(i) temporarily, especially due to downtime, technical issues or force majeure; or<br />(ii) permanently, especially due to a Partner discontinuing its services.</p><p><b>3.3.5</b> Against the background set out in Section 3.3.4, Vorwerk reserves the right to discontinue temporarily or permanently the affected features in case of Section 3.3.4 sentence 3.</p><h3 id="tos_p_03_04.00.00">3.4 Term and Termination</h3><p><b>3.4.1</b> The User may use the subscribed Content during the term of the Cookidoo® Subscription unless the Cookidoo® account of the User has been disabled according to the Sections 4.2.5, 4.2.9, 4.2.10, 4.2.12 and 4.2.13 of these Terms of Use. After the termination of the Cookidoo® Subscription, the subscribed Content will no longer be available to the User.</p><p><b>3.4.2</b> In case of a Paid Subscription, the Cookidoo® Subscription has a minimum term of one year, beginning with its activation, unless agreed otherwise. Vorwerk reserves the right to offer additionally a minimum term of 30 days, or other minimum terms as agreed otherwise. In such case, the User is free to choose between the offered minimum terms.</p><p><b>3.4.3</b> Unless agreed otherwise, a Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the respective minimum term for further terms of the same duration as the minimum term each, provided that neither Party terminates the Paid Subscription pursuant to Section 3.4.7. The User will receive a reminder email about the impending renewal one week prior to the renewal of a 30-days subscription (if any) or 30 days prior to the renewal of the annual subscription. In this reminder email, Vorwerk will inform the User once again, inter alia, about the consequence of not terminating the current Paid Subscription prior to its renewal.</p><p><b>3.4.4</b> The renewal of the Paid Subscription pursuant to Section 3.4.3 does not entail an additional right of withdrawal. The right of withdrawal referred to in Section 5.2 only applies to the initial conclusion of the contract.</p><p><b>3.4.5</b> A Free Subscription ends at the end of the specified period if no Paid Subscription has been agreed. Otherwise, a Free Subscription is followed by a Paid Subscription.

In particular, the User has to make sure that Customer Recipes do not violate the terms of use of any third-party website;<br />(vi) sales and demonstration offers or hidden advertisement for any service or product. In particular, it is not allowed to link to external internet pages for this purpose;<br />(vii) recipes containing ingredients or instructions which may cause harm or damage to the User, other users, to the Thermomix® Cooking Appliances or to third parties’ health or property;<br />(viii) unrelated content (e.g. recipes containing content other than for cooking recipes for food and beverages for human consumption (containing instructions and tips on ingredients and their preparation) plus a photo of the respective dish);<br />(ix) content containing instructions on circumventing, for example, security and safety measures as well as the proper sales channels, or on the prohibited sharing of accounts, references to pricing errors or the like or links to external recipes.<br />(x) content that promotes sexually explicit material, violence or any illegal activity;<br />(xi) content that violates applicable law, e.g., terrorist content, content in violation of consumer or youth protection law, copyright infringements, unlawful non-consensual sharing of private images;<br />(xii) content that violates these Terms of Use;<br />(xiii) links leading to content described in the foregoing.</p><h3 id="tos_p_04_02.00.00">4.2 Moderation tools and procedures</h3><p><b>4.2.1</b> To enforce the rules under Section 4.1, Vorwerk may take moderation measures as described in the following.</p><p><b>4.2.2</b> Immediately after publication, content may be automatically rule-based checked by smart filters. Those smart filters aim to detect Prohibited Content. Where the filters detect content that constitute a very high threat or an obvious violation, the respective content may disappear. In case content uploaded by the same User is repeatedly deleted, the User may be automatically blocked after a prior warning. Besides the foregoing, the content may be manually reviewed by a Vorwerk moderator to ensure a user-friendly environment.</p><p><b>4.2.3</b> Content will also be manually reviewed by a Vorwerk moderator if the content was reported via the flag feature or other reporting tool(s) by a User (“<b>Notifier</b>”). After submitting the report, the Notifier will receive a confirmation of receipt of the report if the report contains electronic contact information, and the content will not be visible to the Notifier anymore but might still be displayed to other Users until it is removed due to content moderation. In case the Notifier has reported content that is considered illegal content, he/she will be notified of Vorwerk’s decision in respect of the information to which the report relates and Vorwerk will provide information on the possibilities for redress in respect of that decision.</p><p><b>4.2.4</b> Moderators may, but are not required to, also manually look for Prohibited Content.</p><p><b>4.2.5</b> Vorwerk strives to create a user-friendly environment on Cookidoo®. Therefore, Vorwerk may take appropriate action against Prohibited Content. Those include:<br />(i) removing content;<br />(ii) temporarily blocking Users from one or more features or the Service (time-out);<br />(iii) permanently blocking Users from one or more features or the Service (ban).</p><p><b>4.2.6</b> Vorwerk decides whether a content belongs to those prohibited under Section 4.1 free from arbitrariness and objectively on the basis of the information then available to Vorwerk.</p><p><b>4.2.7</b> The action Vorwerk takes against Prohibited Content depends primarily on the nature (e.g. criminal offense), severity (e.g. threats of death or violence), frequency (in relation to the total number of individual pieces of information and in relation to a given time frame), its consequences (e.g. if another User was harmed or disturbed, how many other Users and if marginalized groups were affected) as well as the intention of the acting User, if possible to identify. Vorwerk will act in an objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner, with due regard to the rights and legitimate interests of all parties involved.</p><p><b>4.2.8</b> However, if Vorwerk identifies Prohibited Content, it will be deleted in any case, as this is the only way Vorwerk can ensure that other Users cannot perceive Prohibited Content.</p><p><b>4.2.9</b> In the event of serious or multiple violations of applicable laws or these Terms of Use, Vorwerk may also impose a time-out (usually for several days) after a prior warning, the length of which depends on the severity and frequency of violations. Depending on the criteria just mentioned, the time-out may relate to only one or more features or to the Cookidoo® Service as a whole.</p><p><b>4.2.10</b> A permanent blocking (incl. the blocking of any subsequent registration or Cookidoo® account) is the exceptional case and only comes into consideration after a prior warning and in the case of particularly serious or frequent violations (e.g. if Users are using a spam bot submitting a multitude of Customer Recipes containing advertisement within a few seconds). Depending on the criteria just mentioned, such permanent blocking may relate to only one or more features or to the Cookidoo® Service as a whole.</p><p><b>4.2.11</b> When Vorwerk takes the foregoing measures, Vorwerk will always explain the decision to the User concerned (“<b>Statement Of Reasons</b>”), if Vorwerk knows the relevant electronic contact details. Vorwerk will explain which restriction Vorwerk imposes, the facts and circumstances relied on in taking the decision, where applicable information on the use made of automated means in taking the decision, a reference to the legal ground relied on or to the contractual ground relied on and Vorwerk will inform the User about the possibilities for redress available in respect of the decisions.</p><p><b>4.2.12</b> Vorwerk may also impose a time-out on a User, for a reasonable period of time and after having issued a prior warning, if a User frequently submits reports or complaints that are manifestly unfounded through the flag feature mentioned under Section 4.2.3. Vorwerk’s decision on the suspension depends on the nature (e.g. notices without relation to Prohibited Content or content moderation decisions), severity (e.g. harassment, defamation), frequency (in relation to the total number of reports and complaints and in relation to a given time frame), its consequences (e.g. disruption of services and Vorwerk employees, content moderation decisions at the expense of third parties) as well as the intention of the acting User, if possible to identify.</p><p><b>4.2.13</b> Please note that Vorwerk may also take measures against Users or content violating applicable law upon the receipt of an order to act against a User or one or more specific items of illegal Content, issued by the relevant national judicial or administrative authorities, on the basis of the applicable law. In this case, Vorwerk will not send the User concerned a Statement Of Reasons written by us as explained in Section 4.2.11, but inform the User concerned of the order received and the effect given to it. The User affected will also receive a Statement Of Reasons written by the relevant national judicial or administrative authorities and will be informed about the possibilities for redress and a description of the territorial scope of the order.</p><p><b>4.2.14</b> Where Vorwerk becomes aware of any information giving rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of a person or persons has taken place, is taking place or is likely to take place, Vorwerk will promptly inform respective law enforcement or judicial authorities of Vorwerk’s suspicion and provide all relevant information available.</p><h2 id="tos_p_05_00.00.00">5 Legally Mandatory Information</h2><h3 id="tos_p_05_01.00.00">5.1 Further Information</h3><p><b>5.1.1</b> The following information and stipulations are mandatory under applicable laws in some countries.</p><p><b>5.1.2</b> Vorwerk’s offers are legally binding.</p><p><b>5.1.3</b> The exclusive language available for the conclusion of the agreement is English.</p><p><b>5.1.4</b> The essential contract data, such as term of the agreement and remuneration, will be stored by Vorwerk in electronic form and made accessible to the User through Cookidoo®.

California users are also entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</p><p><b>6.3.2</b> The User acknowledges that these Terms of Use are a contract between The User and Vorwerk, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by The User and Vorwerk, and it governs The User’s use of the Services.</p><p><b>6.3.3</b> Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate“ pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA“). The User and Vorwerk expressly agree and intend that this Section satisfy the “writing“ requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. For purposes of this Section, “Claims“ means collectively, and without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Services, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) The User’s use of the Services.</p><p><b>6.3.4</b> If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Services, or these Terms of Use, other than as may be provided herein, then The User and Vorwerk agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. Vorwerk’s notice to The User will be sent based on the most recent contact information that The User provided Vorwerk. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, Vorwerk has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, The User and Vorwerk will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either The User or Vorwerk to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which The User and Vorwerk, in each of the parties' sole discretion, are not satisfied.</p><p><b>6.3.5</b> If The User and Vorwerk cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then The User agree that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to The User’s use of the Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below. However, The User and Vorwerk agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between The User and Vorwerk regarding these Terms of Use, the Services, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THE USER’S ACCOUNT OR THE SERVICE.</p><p><b>6.3.6</b> To begin an arbitration proceeding, The User must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing The User’s claim to Vorwerk as stated herein. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS's rules. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) as is mutually agreed upon. The User can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS: 800.352.5267 and https://www.jamsadr.com.</p><p><b>6.3.7</b> The User and Vorwerk will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Vorwerk to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Vorwerk will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Arbitration rules may permit Vorwerk to recover attorneys' fees. Vorwerk will not seek to recover attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p><p><b>6.3.8</b> Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, The User or Vorwerk may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights). The User or Vorwerk may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to The User or to a particular Claim, either as a result of The User’s decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, The User agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in Los Angeles County, California.
