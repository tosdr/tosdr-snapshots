            A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your
            computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this
            Service easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and
            preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an
            online store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever
            you return to our Service, so you do not need to reenter your
            identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to
            accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies
            or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult
            your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you
            choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some
            parts of this Service will not function properly or may perform
            considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to
            set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty downloading
            tablatures, watching videos or utilizing the Community Forums. Some of our
            web pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel
            GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access
            cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page,
            including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear
            GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on
            a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet
            browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are
            so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is
            better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in
            our email products in order to determine information about the opening and
            reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve
            ads on our web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner
            advertisements. Clear GIFs set by Ultimate Guitar generally are not used to
            collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our users,
            though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular
            actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous
            statistics about web Service or email product usage.
