            Service
            via the iOS platform, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase</p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">3.2 Your subscription will continue automatically at the fee rate applicable to the
            Service, which you have
            selected unless terminated by Ultimate Guitar or until you notify Ultimate Guitar of your decision to cancel
            your subscription to the Service via your account portal. See the Section entitled "Termination /
            Cancellation" for cancellation instructions. All subscriptions require a commitment for a minimum period(s)
            of time ("Service Level Period") and, consequently, cannot be cancelled until the end of the Service Level
            Period. You may, at any time during your subscription period, set your account to cancel, or select another
            monthly, quarterly , semiannual, or annual subscription plan into which to renew, effective at the end of
            your then-current plan. At the end of your monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription period(s),
            your subscription will automatically renew (the &ldquo;Renewal Date&rdquo;) and you will be billed for a
            monthly, quarterly, semiannual, annual or biennial subscription respectively at your then-current plan
            level, unless you elect to terminate the Service pursuant to Section 4 at the rates in effect when the
            charges were incurred. All fees and charges are nonrefundable. You will receive an email notice
            approximately 30 days prior to the Renewal Date. The notice will let you know that your current subscription
            term is about to end and the Renewal Date when your subscription will be renewed and your account charged.
            All notices regarding your subscription will be sent to your last email of record. Please keep a record of
            when your subscription term ends and the next Renewal Date. You are responsible for timely canceling your
            subscription regardless of whether you receive any notice from us. Monthly or yearly subscriptions
            automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the&nbsp;current
            period. The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You&nbsp;can
            manage your subscription - change or cancel auto-renewal - in your Account Settings after
            purchase</p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">3.3 If, when registering, you signed up for a subscription with a "Trial Period," you
            will be allowed a
            period during which you can try out the Service. Only one Trial Period is permitted per person. Certain
            Content may not be available for access during your Trial Period. The Trial Period will expire upon the last
            day of the number of days indicated in the Trial Period offer concerned ("Expiration of the Trial Period").
            (Please refer to the confirmation provided on the site and via email for the specific terms of your Trial
            Period). If you terminate the Service prior to the Expiration of the Trial Period, you will not have any
            further obligation with respect to the version of the Service to which you have committed and any remaining
            Trial Period credits will expire. If you do not terminate and do nothing, at the Expiration of the Trial
            Period, you will be automatically subscribed to the UG Pro Service and billed based on the payment plan
            selected when you registered (or as you may have updated through the "Your Account" section of the Service).
            By signing up to a Trial Period, you understand and agree that: (i) you will be required to provide billing
            payment method upon registration; (ii) Ultimate Guitar will obtain a pre-authorization for the fee amount
            that you will be charged at the Expiration of the Trial Period. It is possible that some financial
            institutions may perceive these requested amounts as actual pending charges. These are not actual charges
            however, and you are solely responsible for any rules that your credit card company applies to them, such as
            overdraft fees.&nbsp;A purchased subscription activates immediately and eliminates any unused portion of a
            free trial period</p>

            VISA, MasterCard,
            American Express and Discover), or any other methods of payment as Ultimate Guitar may accept from time to
            time. If Ultimate Guitar does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay
            all amounts due upon demand by Ultimate Guitar. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your
            designated card in connection with the Service, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement
            to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ULTIMATE GUITAR, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
            PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.&nbsp;If
            you want to designate a different credit card or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration
            date, or if you believe someone has accessed the Service using your IDs without your authorization, you must
            contact Ultimate Guitar immediately at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8abada8a8b7aaac98adb4acb1b5b9acbdf5bfadb1acb9aaf6bbb7b5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="780b0d0808170a0c380d140c1115190c1d551f0d110c190a561b1715">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>

            and payable. Unless you notify Ultimate Guitar of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first
            appear on your account statement, they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution
            of inquiries made by your card issuer. You release Ultimate Guitar from all liabilities and claim of loss

        <p class="ug-news-text">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ULTIMATE GUITAR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR

        <p class="ug-news-text">If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn&rsquo;t

            Guitar&rsquo;s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material
            contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Ultimate Guitar isn&rsquo;t liable for damages
            that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability
            won&rsquo;t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal
            injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something
            we have specifically promised to you.

        <h2 class="ug-news-h3">10. INDEMNITY</h2>
        <p class="ug-news-text">

            reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees' and other reasonable costs of litigation or proceedings) arising
            from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner related to any claim or action based upon (a) your breach
            of, or failure to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) your use of the Service,
            and/or (c) the use of the Service by any other person using your IDs. We may, in our discretion, participate
            in the defense of any such claim or action and any negotiations for its settlement or compromise. No
            settlement which may adversely affect our rights or obligations shall be made without our prior written
            approval. We reserve the right, at our own expense and on notice to you, to assume exclusive defense and
            control of any such claim or action and then your corresponding indemnification obligation will
            end.</p>

            its conflict of laws
            principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes
            arising from or in connection with this agreement is San Francisco County, California, or the United States
            District Court for the Northern District of California and our dispute will be determined under California
            law. If you are a consumer in the EEA, this won&rsquo;t deprive you of any protection you have under the law
            of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.
