categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.</p>

processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>6.13. You have the right to request not to be a subject to a decision based solely on automated
processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly
affects you. However, there are exclusions of this right. Such exclusions include when the decision:
