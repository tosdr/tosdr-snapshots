            Subscription or paid service data:
          </p>
          <p>
            When you choose any subscription or paid service provided as part of our Gaana Services, we or our payment
            gateway provider may collect your purchase, address or billing information, including your credit card

            Cookies
          </p>
          <p>
            To improve the responsiveness of the Sites for our Users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools
            to
            collect Information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to
            understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer or device. Unless you voluntarily
            identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if
            we
            assign a cookie to your computer or device. The only personal information a cookie can contain is
            information
            you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or device. Our advertisers and network partners
            may
            also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads etc.), a process that we do not
            control. We receive and store certain types of Information whenever you interact with us via Site or Gaana
            Service though your computer/laptop/netbook or mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device etc.

            Opting out
          </p>
          <p>
            If a User opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the User's browser is
            overwritten
            with the phrase "OPT OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be
            associated
            with a particular browser.

            number,
            including your IP address, when you visit our site, application or service. Your IP address is a number that
            lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the pages you view. We

            We may use "clear GIFs" (Web Beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our Users in an anonymous
            manner,
            without personally identifying the User. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users
            to
            track which emails are opened by recipients. We use this information to inter-alia deliver our web pages to

          towards helping us gain understanding of our users' demographics and interests. The reports are anonymous and
          cannot be associated with any individual personally identifiable information that you may have shared with us.
          You can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the
          Ads Settings options provided by Google.</p>

          personally identifiable information) about your visits to this and other websites or application, in order to
          provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

      <li><strong class="heading">ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
        <p>When you use the Gaana Services or Sites (or any of its sub sites), we make good faith efforts to provide
          you, as and when requested by you, with access to your personal information and shall further ensure that any
          personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be
          corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal information or sensitive
          personal data or information to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual
          users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
          processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
          systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
          impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is
          not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this
          service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we
          maintain certain services, and due to the requirements under applicable laws for retaining and preserving
          information after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are
          deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>

      <li><strong class="heading">INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>
        <p> We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
          disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
          processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to
          guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All information gathered on Site is
          securely stored within the Company controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a
          firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our
          security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database,
          nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over
          the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to
