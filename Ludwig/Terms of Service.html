<li>In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
<li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
</ul>

<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
<h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
<p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>

<p>Prices on this Website are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>including all applicable fees, taxes and costs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="offers-and-discounts">Offers and discounts</h3>
<p>The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products. Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of this Website.</p>

<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>

<p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>

<p>Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3 id="coupons">Coupons</h3>
<p>Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.</p>

<p>If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Owner can legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights and interests.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the provisions below, any additional or diverging rules applicable to using the Coupon displayed in the corresponding information page or on the Coupon itself shall always prevail.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, these rules apply to the use of Coupons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each Coupon is only valid when used in the manner and within the timeframe specified on the website and/or the Coupon;</li>
<li>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>
<li>Unless otherwise stated, single-use Coupons may only be used once per purchase and therefore may only be applied a single time even in cases involving installment-based purchases;</li>
<li>A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;</li>
<li>The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer. After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</li>
<li>The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;</li>
<li>The Coupon is intended solely for non–commercial use. Any reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Coupon.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="methods-of-payment">Methods of payment</h3>
<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>

<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Website.</p>
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Website does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>

<p>If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the User.</p>
<h3 id="authorization-for-future-paypal-payment">Authorization for future PayPal payment</h3>
<p>If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, this Website will store an identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize this Website to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.</p>

<p>This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal.</p>
<h3 id="purchase-via-app-store">Purchase via app store</h3>
<p>This Website or specific Products available for sale on this Website must be purchased via a third-party app store. To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as &quot;Apple App Store&quot; or &quot;Google Play&quot;), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>

<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>
<h3 id="retention-of-usage-rights">Retention of usage rights</h3>
<p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>
<h3 id="contractual-right-of-cancellation">Contractual right of cancellation</h3>

<h4 id="termination-of-open-ended-subscriptions">Termination of open-ended subscriptions</h4>
<p><strong>Open-ended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside this Application.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Terminations shall take effect 7 days after the notice of termination has been received by the Owner.</strong></p>
<h4 id="terms-and-conditions-applying-to-extra-features">Terms and conditions applying to extra features</h4>
<p>Users that have an active subscription may purchase single extra add-ons or features, described in the relevant section of this Website.<br/>
Unless otherwise specified, such extras are subject to the same terms applicable to the main Product, including all provisions of this document.</p>

<h2 id="user-rights">User rights</h2><h3 id="right-of-withdrawal">Right of withdrawal</h3>
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
<h4 id="who-the-right-of-withdrawal-applies-to">Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h4>
<p>The right of withdrawal is a right designed for European Consumers in the case of distance contracts (because the User is not able to see or try the Products before closing the contract). Withdrawal from the contract terminates the obligation of the contracting parties to perform the contract.</p>

<p><strong>On this Website the right of withdrawal applies to all Users, without prejudice to any more specific rights available to Users based on applicable law and/or this document</strong>.</p>

<p>Unless any exception mentioned below applies, if any, Users have a right to withdraw from the contract within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<h4 id="exercising-the-right-of-withdrawal">Exercising the right of withdrawal</h4>
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>

<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>

<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="effects-of-withdrawal">Effects of withdrawal</h4>
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>

<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>

<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-purchase-of-services">…on the purchase of services</h5>
<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
<h4 id="exceptions-from-the-right-of-withdrawal">Exceptions from the right of withdrawal</h4>
<p>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the provision of services, after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with their acknowledgement that their right of withdrawal is lost once the contract has been fully performed;</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="contractual-withdrawal-period-extension">Contractual withdrawal period extension </h4>
<p>In addition, and without prejudice to the statutory right of withdrawal or any other statutory rights, including guarantee rights, the Owner grants Users a contractual right to withdraw from the contract within 15 days. Users can therefore withdraw from the contract even once the statutory withdrawal period has expired.</p>

<p>The contractual extension of the withdrawal period is subject to the same conditions stated for the statutory right of withdrawal, including those for determining the beginning and the end of the withdrawal period.</p>


<h2 id="liability-and-indemnification">Liability and indemnification</h2><h4 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h4>
<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand ⁠— including but not limited to lawyer&#x27;s fees and costs ⁠— made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
<h4 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).</p>

<p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as this Website has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>

<p>Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.</p>
<p>In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:</p>
<ul>
<li>any losses that are not the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;</li>
</ul>

<li>any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.);</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>damages or losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of this Website due to acts of force majeure, or unforeseen and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the will and beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or electrical lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission, unavailability of websites, strikes, natural disasters, viruses and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products, third-party services or applications;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>any damage, prejudice or loss occurring due to viruses or other malware contained in or connected to files available for download from the internet or via this Website. Users are responsible for implementing sufficient security measures – such as anti-viruses and firewalls to prevent any such infection or attack and for securing backup copies of all data or information exchanged via or uploaded to this Website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:</p>
<p>In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.</p>
