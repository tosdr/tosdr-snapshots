However, you can still use Google Analytics if you are covered by HIPAA. Just don't send PHI to GA4. This article explains how to avoid a HIPAA privacy rule violation when using Google Analytics","content":"Healthcare organizations rely on web analytics tools to gather insights into website performance and user behavior. Google Analytics is one of the most popular tools for this purpose. However, when it comes to handling Protected Health Information (\"PHI\"), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") sets stringent privacy and security standards that Google Analytics does not meet. Despite this, it is possible to use Google Analytics in a HIPAA-compliant manner by anonymizing the data and not sending PHI to Google Analytics.\n\n## Using Google Analytics 4 with Google Tag Manager in a HIPAA-Compliant Way\nTo ensure HIPAA compliance when using [Google Analytics 4](/services/ga4) (GA4) with Google Tag Manager (GTM), follow these steps:\n\n1. Data Layer Configuration: Set up a data layer in GTM to control and manage the information sent to GA4. This prevents PHI from being accidentally transmitted.\n2. Anonymize IP Addresses: Enable IP anonymization in GA4 settings to mask the last part of visitors' IP addresses.\n3. Disable Data Sharing: Turn off all data sharing settings in GA4 to prevent Google from accessing your data for its purposes.\n4. Avoid Collecting PHI: Do not track or collect any information that could be classified as PHI, such as names, email addresses, or medical record numbers.\n5. Enable 'Restricted Data Processing': Use this setting in GA4 to limit how data is processed and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.\n6. User Consent: Implement user consent mechanisms on your website to comply with various privacy laws and ensure that users agree to your data collection practices.\n7. Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of your tracking tags and triggers in GTM to ensure that no PHI is being captured or sent to GA4.\n\n## HIPAA-Compliant Analytics Alternatives: Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki\nFor healthcare organizations seeking alternatives to Google Analytics that are HIPAA-compliant, tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki offer a powerful combination for monitoring and analyzing data while adhering to HIPAA regulations. Using the Grafana stack, [Fruition's Cloud hosting](/services/hosting) is setup with HIPAA compliant analytics and logging! \n\nAt Fruition, we utilized the following setup on hardening infrastructure to provide HIPAA compliant website analytics for our healthcare clients: \n1. Grafana: An open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application that allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics. Grafana can be configured to use data that has been properly secured and anonymized.\n2. Prometheus: An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database, and modern alerting approach. Prometheus is set up within a HIPAA-compliant infrastructure to monitor system performance without handling PHI.\n3. Loki: A horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate, as it does not index the contents of logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.\n\n### When integrating these tools:\n\n1. Ensure Data Encryption: Data in transit and at rest should be encrypted to protect any sensitive information.\n2. Access Control: Implement strong access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the monitoring and analytics tools.\n3. Logging and Auditing: Maintain comprehensive logs of access and changes to monitoring systems to ensure traceability and accountability.\n4. Data Anonymization: Ensure that any data processed by these tools is anonymized and does not contain PHI.\n5. Compliance Documentation: Keep thorough documentation of your compliance measures, data flows, and data handling procedures.\n\nBy taking these steps and utilizing HIPAA-compliant tools, healthcare organizations can gather valuable insights from their data analytics practices while maintaining the privacy and security of patient information as mandated by HIPAA.\n\n## Fruition's HIPAA Compliant Analytics \nFruition hosts many healthcare organizations websites and other applications. We have Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki setup so the sites we host are compliant from day one (including the staging environments). \n\n## HIPAA Covered Entities Can Use Google Analytics, Just Don't Send PHI to Google\nWhile Google Analytics is not HIPAA-compliant out of the box, with careful configuration and data handling practices, it can be used in a manner that respects patient privacy. Alternatively, using tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki can offer a more straightforward path to HIPAA-compliant analytics. The key to success lies in a thorough understanding of HIPAA requirements and diligent management of data flows and analytics processes.\n### \n\nAdditional Research: \n[HIPAA and Online Tracking Guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/hipaa-online-tracking/index.html)\n\n[Google Analytics Data Privacy and Security](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13297105?hl=en)","slug":"hipaa-google-analytics","createdAt":"2024-04-10T19:03:18.400Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-23T14:22:42.092Z","publishedAt":"2024-04-10T19:06:59.032Z","createdOverrideDate":null,"isFeatured":false,"readingTime":9,"image":{"data":{"id":1040,"attributes":{"name":"ga-hipaa-privacy.png","alternativeText":"HIPAA Compliance with Google Analytics and HIPAA-Compliant Alternatives","caption":null,"width":2424,"height":1440,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/large_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967.png","hash":"large_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967","mime":"image/png","name":"large_ga-hipaa-privacy.png","path":null,"size":142.83,"width":1000,"height":594},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/small_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967.png","hash":"small_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967","mime":"image/png","name":"small_ga-hipaa-privacy.png","path":null,"size":50.85,"width":500,"height":297},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/medium_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967.png","hash":"medium_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_ga-hipaa-privacy.png","path":null,"size":91.79,"width":750,"height":446},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/thumbnail_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967.png","hash":"thumbnail_ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_ga-hipaa-privacy.png","path":null,"size":18.39,"width":245,"height":146}},"hash":"ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":71.19,"url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/ga_hipaa_privacy_3c2abd5967.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-04-11T15:03:30.201Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-23T14:22:37.114Z"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"name":"Brad Anderson","email":"brad@fruition.net","createdAt":"2023-03-10T01:20:04.925Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-07T15:29:05.286Z","teamUrl":"brad-anderson","role":"Founder","picture":{"data":{"id":946,"attributes":{"name":"Headshot-Brad-Anderson-min.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":334,"height":337,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/thumbnail_Headshot_Brad_Anderson_min_85f3782a9c.png","hash":"thumbnail_Headshot_Brad_Anderson_min_85f3782a9c","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_Headshot-Brad-Anderson-min.png","path":null,"size":36.21,"width":155,"height":156}},"hash":"Headshot_Brad_Anderson_min_85f3782a9c","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":39.7,"url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/Headshot_Brad_Anderson_min_85f3782a9c.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-03-06T20:49:30.998Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-06T20:49:30.998Z","related":{"data":[{"id":1,"attributes":{"__type":"api::team-member.team-member","name":"Brad Anderson","createdAt":"2023-04-05T04:43:00.458Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-06T20:51:00.164Z","publishedAt":"2023-04-05T04:45:06.611Z","slug":"brad-anderson","position":"CTO / Founder","biography":"## Founder of Fruition\nBrad Anderson is Fruition's founder and former CEO of Fruition.

This law is aimed at ensuring that state and local government websites meet the requisite accessibility standards. This summary encapsulates the salient points of the law and the necessary steps government organizations should take to comply with its provisions.\n\nThe law mandates that all state agencies and political subdivisions make their websites accessible to individuals with disabilities, making sure that every Coloradan, regardless of their physical abilities, can access information and services provided by the government. The law takes its cue from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a set of international standards widely recognized in the digital industry. It requires all state and local government sites to meet as a minimum standard of accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA, helping to ensure that digital content is accessible to all.\n\nAll State agencies and local governments must be compliant with state standards by July 1, 2024. However, a recent extension provides a one-year grace period until July 1, 2025, for agencies who can demonstrate good faith efforts toward compliance.\n\n**Steps To Meeting ADA Standards**\n\nColorado state and local government organizations need to take several critical steps:\n\n1. **Conduct an Audit:** State and local government organizations should conduct an audit of their current websites and digital platforms to evaluate the level of accessibility. This audit should be thorough and cover all aspects of the site, including images, text, forms, and multimedia content.\n \n2. **Identify and Plan:** Based on the audit, organizations should identify areas that need improvement and develop a plan to address the identified shortcomings. The plan should be comprehensive, detailing the changes to be made, the timeline for these changes, and the person or team responsible for implementation.\n \n3. **Implement the Plan:** Organizations need to implement the plan. This may necessitate hiring or consulting with experts in digital accessibility and training staff on how to create and maintain accessible digital content.\n\n4. **Monitor and Maintain:** Once the plan has been implemented, accessibility compliance work has only just begun. It is crucial to monitor and maintain the accessibility of the site on an ongoing basis. Changes in content, technology, and user needs will necessitate ongoing adjustments. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure continued compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nThe Accessibility Law for Colorado State and Local Government is a vital step towards digital inclusion for all Colorado citizens. Government organizations should take active steps not just to comply with the law but also to ensure that their services are accessible to all Coloradans, affirming their commitment to equality and inclusivity.\n\n**How Can Fruition Assist its Partners with Meeting Accessibility (ADA) Compliance Requirements?**\n\nFruition has extensive experience helping our clients’ websites meet Accessibility (ADA) Compliance requirements and is positioned to assist Colorado State and Local Government partners in meeting and exceeding these standards.\n\nOur services are designed to bring your website's code and theme layer into compliance with ADA WCAG 2.2 AA requirements. We can work with you to determine the necessary effort to strive towards accessibility compliance, regardless of whether your website is in the building stage, newly launched, or already existing. While we do not provide legal advice, our services are tailored to align your digital presence with the highest standards of accessibility and inclusivity.\n\n**Fruition Offers Two Levels of Accessibility Services for New and Existing Websites:**\n\n**Accessibility Services For New Websites**\n\n- **Basic Service:** Automated Scans and Remediation. As part of a new website build project, we will conduct automated scans and tests for compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility using third-party software. All issues revealed by the scans that violate WCAG 2.2 A \u0026 AA best practices will be remediated by our team before site launch. This service focuses on code, templates, and assets that are controllable within the building of the website but does not include UI/Design accessibility testing, or testing of third-party embeds, migrated content, or PDFs. It's important to note that the basic service approach does not guarantee that a website will be ADA-compliant at launch.\n\n- **Premium Service:** Manual Review/Live User Testing and Remediations. Automated ADA compliance scans generally flag only 25% to 30% of the WCAG 2.2 A \u0026 AA guidelines. The remaining guidelines can only be tested via manual user testing using various screen readers and other accessibility tools. Premium service includes a manual review of a specified number of templates/components, review, feedback, verification, and consulting during Design, Development, and QA, and user testing upon completion of the site. Additionally, we provide conformance documentation and an Accessibility Statement.\n\n**Accessibility Services For Existing Websites**\nIn addition to the New Website Build ADA compliance services, Fruition also offers Accessibility (ADA) Compliance services for existing websites, and/or post-launch to ensure your website remains compliant as your website evolves along with the ever-changing ADA standards. As your site is frequently updated with new content, images, alt-tags, menu, and link structures, it's important to maintain compliance.\n\n- **Basic Service:** Automated ADA Scans. We recognize that ADA compliance is not a one-off task but an ongoing effort. We offer weekly, monthly, or quarterly Automated ADA scans as part of an ongoing engagement. The process includes an automated scan of the website to assess HTML pages, analysis of scan results, prioritizing remediations based on impact, and re-scanning to ensure the remediations are working. Again, automated scans will not ensure ADA compliance but will allow you to address readily identifiable gaps and work toward compliance.\n\n- **Premium Service:** Manual Review ADA Audit. Recommended on a quarterly or bi-annual basis. As automated ADA compliance scans generally flag only 25% to 30% of the WCAG 2.2 A \u0026 AA guidelines, this service manually tests the remaining guidelines using various screen readers and other accessibility tools. The Manual Review Audit includes initial conformance documentation, proactive accessibility statement, automated and manual testing to WCAG 2.2AA, identification of issues, estimation of efforts to complete prioritized remediations, final round of automated \u0026 manual testing, QA review of remediated code implementation, meetings to review results, and final conformance documentation.\n\nAlongside any effort you elect to undertake with Fruition with respect to ADA Compliance, we also recommend training your internal team members on ADA best practices for website management, designating an ADA officer responsible for managing ongoing efforts, and maintaining an ADA policy on your website.\n\nFruition understands the importance of ADA compliance and is committed to helping your organization meet and exceed the standards set by HB21-1110, ensuring a truly inclusive digital environment for all users.\n\nIf you need support in getting your site ADA compliant, Fruition is here to help.

Here we'll delve into seven foundational best practices that daily users of GA4 should implement immediately.\n\n## 1. Review how (and why) you're tracking data before switching to GA4\nTo optimize analytics performance, focus on key questions about how users are interacting with your site:\n\n1. Is our website attracting visitors that match our target audiences and markets?\n2. Where do our visitors originate?\n3. How are users engaging with our website?\n4. Is our website successful at converting visitors into leads?\n\n## 2. Ensure your data is flowing smoothly\nUnderstanding the basics of GA4 functions is crucial, starting with setting up your Google Analytics Accounts, initiating a data stream, confirming the data flow, and regularly monitoring your analytics to identify patterns and trends.\n\n## 3. Set up internal filtering\nFilter out internal traffic, including data from your marketing team, main office employees, contractors, etc., to get an accurate representation of your actual user base.\n\n## 4. Understand the difference between event types \nIn GA4's tracking system, there are four broad categories of events you should be aware of:\n\n1. Automatically Collected Events\n2. Enhanced Measurement Events\n3. Recommended Events\n4. Custom Events\n\n## 5. Learn the basics of Google Tag Manager \u0026 Google Looker Studio\nGoogle Tag Manager (GTM) is for collecting data, GA4 is for storing data and basic analysis, and Looker Studio is for presenting that data to key stakeholders. Utilizing these tools to their full potential improves data collection accuracy and analytics reporting.\n\n## 6. Integrate with Google Search Console \u0026 Google Ads\nIntegration with other data sources enhances the depth and accuracy of the data you collect on GA4. Equally, it helps in more precise ad targeting and comprehensive data collection.\n\n## 7. Leverage GA4 data to improve your user experience\nThe primary reason for tracking data is to improve the user experience for those visiting your site. GA4 provides the ability to make informed decisions about refining digital strategies effectively.\n\nIn the realm of digital analytics, there's a significant power in knowledge. Using GA4 is not just about accumulating traffic data but understanding how your users interact with your website and improving the overall experience.","slug":"7-google-analytics-4-ga4-best-practices-for-optimizing","createdAt":"2023-12-13T03:08:05.643Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-23T14:25:42.012Z","publishedAt":"2023-12-13T03:08:05.492Z","createdOverrideDate":null,"isFeatured":null,"readingTime":null,"image":{"data":{"id":643,"attributes":{"name":"2023-12-12T22:47:21.055Z_480.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":2424,"height":1440,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/large_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39.png","hash":"large_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39","mime":"image/png","name":"large_2023-12-12T22:47:21.055Z_480.png","path":null,"size":278.05,"width":1000,"height":594},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/small_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39.png","hash":"small_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39","mime":"image/png","name":"small_2023-12-12T22:47:21.055Z_480.png","path":null,"size":74.34,"width":500,"height":297},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/medium_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39.png","hash":"medium_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_2023-12-12T22:47:21.055Z_480.png","path":null,"size":149.89,"width":750,"height":446},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/thumbnail_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39.png","hash":"thumbnail_2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_2023-12-12T22:47:21.055Z_480.png","path":null,"size":23.81,"width":245,"height":146}},"hash":"2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":317.8,"url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/2023_12_12_T22_47_21_055_Z_480_d511e8db39.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-12-13T03:08:04.836Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-23T14:25:37.734Z"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":17,"attributes":{"name":"Amber Blacharski","email":"amber.blarcharski+blog@fruition.net","createdAt":"2023-05-07T11:36:40.237Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-07T15:26:41.709Z","teamUrl":"amber-blacharski","role":"Email Marketing Specialist","picture":{"data":{"id":944,"attributes":{"name":"Headshot-Amber-Blacharski-min.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":334,"height":337,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/thumbnail_Headshot_Amber_Blacharski_min_16f5ab3cc8.png","hash":"thumbnail_Headshot_Amber_Blacharski_min_16f5ab3cc8","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_Headshot-Amber-Blacharski-min.png","path":null,"size":35.7,"width":155,"height":156}},"hash":"Headshot_Amber_Blacharski_min_16f5ab3cc8","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":34.45,"url":"https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/cdn.fruition.net/Headshot_Amber_Blacharski_min_16f5ab3cc8.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-03-06T20:49:18.135Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-06T20:49:18.135Z","related":{"data":[{"id":17,"attributes":{"__type":"api::writer.writer","name":"Amber Blacharski","email":"amber.blarcharski+blog@fruition.net","createdAt":"2023-05-07T11:36:40.237Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-07T15:26:41.709Z","teamUrl":"amber-blacharski","role":"Email Marketing Specialist"}}]}}}}}}}}}]}}]}},{"id":31,"attributes":{"title":"Frontend Javascript developer / Integrations ","slug":"frontend-javascript-developer-integrations-nextjs-strapi-stripe-apps","createdAt":"2023-05-31T17:15:20.231Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-31T17:15:29.579Z","publishedAt":"2023-05-31T17:15:29.423Z","seo":{"id":63,"metaTitle":"Frontend Javascript developer / Integrations ","metaDescription":"Fruition is hiring a frontend javascript developer to deliver high quality code.

OVERVIEW\nThis Hosting Service Level Agreement (the “SLA”) governs the use of all Hosting Services provided by Fruition to Client. The terms and conditions of the Master Services Agreement between Fruition and Client are incorporated herein as if fully set forth below. The terms “we,” “us” or “our” shall refer to Fruition. The terms “you,” “your,” “User,” or “customer” shall refer to Client. Other defined terms will have the meaning given to them in the Master Services Agreement, or as set out in Paragraph 2 below. Nothing in this SLA shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits. This SLA will control in the event of any conflict between this SLA and the Master Services Agreement and/or any terms and conditions of any Third-Party Provider.\n\n## 2. DEFINITIONS\n“Cloud Agnostic” means Hosting Services that are compatible with many types of cloud hosting platforms and/or Cloud Hosting Environments.\n\n“Cloud Hosting Environment” is the procurement of remote/virtual hosting resources from a Third-Party Provider to host data, services and/or solutions.\n\n“Fruition Cloud Hosting Services” are the Hosting Services provided by Fruition to Client.\n\n“Third-Party Provider” means any third-party Cloud Hosting Environment provider that we may contract with from time to time.\n\n## 3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES\nFruition provides Clients with Drupal and/or WordPress specific, tuned, cloud deployment and hosting. Fruition Cloud Hosting Services are Cloud Agnostic and Fruition will select, in its sole discretion, the Cloud Hosting Environment for Client’s hosting workload. Cloud Hosting Environments include, but may not be limited to, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Vercel, Netlify and other distributed hosting cloud service providers. Your use of Fruition Cloud Hosting Services is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Cloud Hosting Environment, which are incorporated herein as if fully set forth below. This SLA will control in the event of any conflict between this SLA and any terms and conditions of any Third-Party Provider.\n\n**Google Cloud Terms and Conditions:**\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/terms/\nhttps://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms\n\n**Amazon AWS Terms and Conditions:**\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/\n\n**Microsoft Azure Terms and Conditions:**\nhttp://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/Downloader.aspx?DocumentId=15056\n\n**Digital Ocean Terms and Conditions:**\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/legal\n\nFruition will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Fruition Cloud Hosting Services twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, except for: (i) periodic maintenance procedures or updates which we may undertake from time to time, and (ii) causes beyond our reasonable control, for example, an act of God, an act of government, Third-Party Provider failure or delay, hostile network attacks, network congestion, or other failures. Unavailability of Fruition Cloud Hosting Services does not constitute a breach of this SLA.\n\nCloudflare is often used for ddos and Web Application Firewall (WAF). You agree to Cloudflare’s Terms and Conditions even if you do not set up the account and agree to their terms and conditions during the setup process. Cloudflare’s Terms and Conditions are available at: https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/\n\nFruition provides Distributed Denial of Service (“DDOS”) protection as a complimentary service up to 500 mbs. Over that amount DDOS fees or forced outages may occur. Higher level DDOS protection is available but not guaranteed to protect all down time. DDOS service is not guaranteed and we may blackhole targeted IPs or suspend targeted service if attack traffic bypasses Fruition’s mitigation facilities. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate services that are frequent targets of DDOS attacks.\n\nFruition Cloud Hosting Services are designed to host most organizations websites, and thus we offer unlimited bandwidth. This means that we do not set a limit on the amount of bandwidth, websites or disk space you may use in the operation of your website, provided it complies with this SLA. In the event the bandwidth, number of websites or disk space usage of your website presents a risk to the stability, performance or up-time of your website, data storage, networking or other infrastructure, you may be required to increase resources or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is utilizing.\n\nSSH or SFTP access is not possible with Fruition Cloud Hosting Services. Access to repositories is possible as is Client access for Client driven deployments.\n\n## 4. HOSTING MIGRATION, BACKUP, TERMINATION\n**Hosting Migration.** If your website is hosted by a third-party, we may, at your request, and upon payment of the applicable Service Fee, attempt to assist you in moving hosting of your website to us (“Hosting Migration”). Fruition does not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete a Hosting Migration. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make us unable to assist you in the transfer of data from a third-party host. You are solely responsible for reviewing the functionality and accuracy of migrated content in its new location following a Hosting Migration. If you are satisfied with the data migration, you will need to update the DNS record for the domain name in order to publish the website in its new location. We do not perform an archive backup of your data from the legacy hosting provider. We recommend that you backup your third-party hosted website before Hosting Migration to ensure that no data is lost. You agree not to make any changes or revisions to your website during Hosting Migration. By requesting a Hosting Migration, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to provide us with access to your third-party hosting account and allow us to migrate the data at the third-party host to us. You agree that you retain sole contractual and any other legal or fiduciary responsibilities related to your third-party hosting account. You agree that we are not liable for any delay in website resolution or loss of data related to your Hosting Migration.\n\n**Backups.** File and database backups are performed no less than every 24 hours to a different data center than the one in which your website is hosted. You acknowledge and agree that as a normal course of business, it may be necessary for us to migrate your site to new datacenters. As a result, even if you have a dedicated IP, you may be assigned a different IP address. We do not warrant that you will be able to consistently maintain your given IP address.\n\n**Termination.** You acknowledge and agree that upon expiration or termination of your Fruition Cloud Hosting Services, you must discontinue use of Fruition Cloud Hosting Services and relinquish use of the IP addresses assigned to you in connection with Fruition Cloud Hosting Services, including (if applicable) pointing the domain name system (“DNS”) for your domain name(s) away from our servers. Prior to termination of Fruition Cloud Hosting Services, you are responsible for moving your website and/or server content. We will not transfer or FTP your website and/or server content to another provider. If you fail to move your website and/or server content prior to cancellation, then all such content will be deleted and we will not be able to provide a copy of such content. Fruition may terminate Fruition Cloud Hosting Services at any time without notice for failure to comply with this SLA or the applicable payment terms for Fruition Cloud Hosting Services.\n\n## 5.

We completed a discovery project that included user surveys, user interviews, and interviews with key stakeholders on the airport team. Being a smaller fish in a big pond, Ontario faces the challenges of competing in a market with a few whales, and we wanted to understand how we might best use the website to meet Ontario’s growth goals in the coming years. From here, we conducted a site content audit, an information architecture planning exercise, a technical audit, and finally, designed wireframes. This work allowed us to complete the rest of the migration planning and helped us better understand the components and templates that would need to be designed to power the new website.\n\n## Design System\nComing fresh off some fun brand work that Ontario completed, our team was very excited to incorporate this into the new website design. Our design process generally starts with moodboards and homepage concepts to explore the visual direction we might want to take. We had a blast with the bright blues, pinks, and deep purples we could incorporate into the site. These colors are also included in a nice gradient overlay throughout the site, including on the homepage, over a fantastic video the Ontario team produced.\n\n## Flight Data Integration\nOne of the fun technical challenges we were able to solve with this project was improving the integration of flight data into the new website. Previously, flight data was stored on a third-party system and delivered via an iFrame with minimal customization available. As a part of the new site, we integrated with the flight data provider’s API to pull, store, and deliver up-to-date flight information for travelers."}]}},{"id":38,"attributes":{"title":"Fru AI Workflows","slug":"fru-ai","createdAt":"2023-11-30T06:42:39.177Z","updatedAt":"2023-11-30T17:54:08.476Z","publishedAt":"2023-11-30T06:43:23.503Z","seo":{"id":69,"metaTitle":"Fru AI Workflows: Transforming Your Processes with AI Automation","metaDescription":"Unlock the potential of AI automation for workflow management.

Fruition excels at complex projects that require high functioning teams that require full-stack development, digital marketing and devops support. \n\n## Build, Grow and Protect®\nFruition’s deep domain expertise includes [health care](/services/healthcare-marketing), [travel \u0026 tourism](/services/travel-and-tourism-marketing), e-commerce and business-to-business ([B2B](/services/business-to-business)). We also have a very strong [government services](/services/government) team. Fruition generates hundreds of millions of dollars in sales within these verticals (and others) every year. Fruition provides consulting, tactical execution and builds transformational digital products (software) for our clients. This translates into significant enterprise value for our clients and for Fruition.\n\n## Join Fruition\nFruition’s hiring process is lead by the business unit leaders and others on the team. Even with a tight job market, we won't sacrifice our values when we're hiring. We want the right people to join the team to help us and our clients continue to gain momentum. Our hiring process is designed to ensure a good fit for the candidate, for Fruition, and for our clients. We do not want a candidate joining the team if it isn’t a good fit. While the process is hard, it is also fair. We do not play games. We mean this literally as well. We’re not going to give you a silly puzzle to solve that will have no correlation with the work that you’ll be doing. \n\nThe goal of our hiring process is to find and foster a great culture and talent fit. If you’re interested in open digital positions in Denver check out our [careers](/careers) page. Logistically, you will have at least four interviews before you receive an offer to join the team. You’ll need a unanimous sign-off from at least four teammates and from the CEO before an offer is presented to you.\n\n### Onboarding Process\nFruition’s onboarding process ensures that all Fruition team members experience the same initial training and introduction to the company. This enables them to quickly become effective and efficient and to understand what it takes to become successful at Fruition through the proper behaviors (kicking ass) and skill set (always be improving).\n\n### Org Chart for Fruition\nHaving a “flat” org chart sounds great until you don’t know who can answer a question for you or help you with a difficult situation. With proper training and a servant-first leadership style, a proper org chart brings clarity to the team.\n\n## Fruition's Culture Deck\nOver the years we've defined what we want from our culture and what we don't want. We've put some structure to this in our [culture deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16UeQ1wB6grayKJ20_8xlCzGrmT7gocIpJ_Wd3aXWRHA/edit?usp=sharing). \n\n## Fundamentals of Performance at Fruition\n1. **We demand exceptional work at all times**\nCruising by and just doing enough won't cut it. Your teammates will know, clients will know, and no one, including yourself, won't be happy.\n\n2. **We own the 20 sq. ft. of space around us**\nWe ruthlessly protect our 20 sq. ft. of space. Meaning we all own the 20 sq. ft. around us. In that 20 sq. ft., we do not tolerate any Blaming, Complaining or Defending (“BCD”). Present solutions, not problems.\n\n3. **Acronyms to know**\n- WTWON™: What to Work on Next™ (a part of Fruition Tools) uses machine learning to improve the work flow of advanced digital marketing individuals and teams.\n- **GSD: Get Sh*t Done**\n- **GAS: Give A Sh*t**\n- **LAST: Listen. Solve. Acknowledge. Thank.**\n- **No BCD: No Blaming, Complaining or Defending.** Look for solutions, not excuses.\n\n4. **Clarity**\nLeaders clearly state what each team member must do to excel, how they are measured and how they can improve in near real time. Annual reviews are not tolerated, because they are slow and miss the teaching opportunity. We all demand a high level of performance of each other. If the performance is not delivered, leaders must make intelligent and deliberate changes to meet Fruition’s stated goals related to exceptional client delivery, as well as client and Fruition growth.  \n\n### Words we care about\n- **Accountability:** Fruition does not have single contributors; the success of an individual, a client, a project, a campaign is determined by the collective team. Individual accountability is a necessity. Accountability is the obligation of an individual to account for activities, accept responsibility for them and disclose results in a transparent manner.\n- **Clarity:** We’ve outgrown games. Clarity cultivates understanding, creates accountability and unites purpose. With our clients and among ourselves, we make it a point to be overly transparent. This fosters efficiency, trust and authenticity, and it ultimately leads to on-time, on-target launches. Confusion is a choice; when something is unclear, ask for clarity.\n- **Agility:** Our world, clients and industry are constantly changing. This requires us to be innovative, fluid and flexible to respond rapidly to changes in our internal and external environments without loosing momentum, vision or clarity.\n- **Fun:** We do work hard, but we also like to have fun — with each other and with our clients. Fun is not ping pong tables in the office. Ping pong tables are a distraction. Fun is seeing a client beat their competitors or exceed one of their target KPIs. Here’s an example of fun: “Without Fruition, we would have been down year over year. Instead, we grew 30% this year, and our profit increased 15%.” That is what fun looks like at Fruition.\n- **Trust:** We believe in each other and trust each other. We value collaboration, we welcome new ideas from our teammates and clients, and we reward great work.\n\n## Delivering exceptional work for clients\nWe treat our clients with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. We get the same in return.  We are always accountable to our clients. If we make a mistake or break something, we own it. If we do something great, we share in the success. \n\n## Communication with clients\nClients deserve timely and **proactive communication**. The cadence of communications with clients is critical. We err on the side of oversharing and over communicating.\n\nCommunication should be thorough. Goals are well defined. Progress toward those goals is documented and shared. If there are issues preventing work from being accomplished, that is to be communicated with a louder voice until the blocker is removed. Communication must not be held back — if something is wrong, we communicate it. \n\nClients shall never hear “we’re at an all-day meeting and can’t get back to you today” or “someone will get back to you in 24-to-48 hours.” Clients do not care what we are doing; they want to know that we are there for them and that if we don’t have an answer, we’ll work expeditiously to get them one.\n\n## Career Progression\nIt takes years to be an expert in the very technical work that we do at Fruition. The 10,000-hour rule is a baseline. Fruition developed a career matrix that helps team members understand where they are at and guide them within their career.\n\n## Fruition’s Business Units\nFruition is organized into 3 business units:\n- **Build** - Development (programmers, developers, engineers, design, web admin)\n- **Grow** -Digital Marketing (SEO, Paid Media, Social Media \u0026 Email Marketing)\n- **Protect** - Data, AI, and hosting. \n\n## Fruition’s Growth Goal\nA fundamental building block of meeting Fruition’s growth is delivering an exceptional client experience and developing innovative software delivered as a service to clients.\n- Annual **revenue growth of 20%** is one key metric that stays consistent year after year. To achieve this we know we have to do an amazing job for our existing clients while also welcoming new clients into our ecosystem. \n\n## Accountability\nAccountability builds trust. When you fail to deliver, or someone has to ask you to deliver what is expected more than once, that trust is erroded. \n\n## Processes\nFruition’s project management processes are documented in our dev and marketing docs. These are our operating procedures with a ting of culture thrown in. \n\nFruition builds software to run many of its processes including our own SEO management tool (https://tools.fruition.net). How to use the tool, including Fruition’s Google Penalty Checker, is documented in Confluence.\n\nFruition’s team member onboarding process is confluence.\n\n## Next steps to work with or to join Fruition\n- If you’re interested in joining Fruition check out our [careers](/careers) page. \n- If you’re interested in having Fruition do work for you [contact](/contact) us.

Fruition's Google penalty checker is the fastest way, and with a high degree of statistical confidence to detect algorithmic penalties. Using statistical analysis Fruition's Google Penalty Checker provides a clear understanding into which Google updates have the most significant impact on your website. Then, Google Penalty Checker's recommendation engine tells you What To Work On Next™ (\"WTWON\") to boost your traffic, and to recover from a Google hit, while also maintaining long-term website health.\n\n## Sign up for the Google Penalty Checker\nWe created the Google Penalty Checker to prove sites weren't penalized\nSince 2008, our in-house math and statistics team leveraged our SEO knowledge and straight-up text book statistics to determine which Google algorithm changes impacted your website. We created this to prove, with a high degree of statistical confidence, that sites weren't penalized.\n\n## Why we created the Google penalty checker\nWe have a client that thought they were penalized (specifically their in-house seo analyst thought they were). We disagreed. We were certain that the dip in organic traffic that we were seeing was primarily seasonality and an adjustment made with the sites content because of a tweak in their business model. We told the client we'd prove it with statistics. We built out that model first in R and then later in python. \n\nUsing the first model we were able to show with a high degree of confidence that the site wasn't penalized and the seo analyst agreed. It was a win win. Because we were able to focus on the right SEO efforts with less guess work. That is how Fruition's Google Penalty Checker was created. And yes, the original client that we created GPC for is still a client going strong after 20 years!\n\n## Use GPC to understand which Google algorithm updates impacted your website\nSite traffic is affected by site downtime, changing seasons, and other factors. GPC cuts through the noise to help you better understand your site’s health. By combining data from hundreds of thousands of other websites, GPC can determine when an algorithm has affected your site.\n\n## How do you sign up for GPC?\nBecause of Google's rate limiting, Fruition's Google Penalty Checker tool is only available to existing clients. Contact us and we'll get you setup. \n\n## How do you manually check for Google Penalties?\nIf you don't want to use Fruition's Google Penalty Checker tool then you can use the following steps to help narrow down if your site was penalized.\n1. Dig into Google Analytics.\nIf you notice a sudden drop in organic traffic, which is probably why you're reading this blog post, this could be a sign that you have been penalized by Google. Do a comparison of Google organic traffic from about two days before the known Google update and two days after with a range of at least 21 days. Sometimes Google updates roll out in waves so you may need to compare a larger time period. This will help you narrow down if there was an organic drop or not.\n1 a. Compare individual pages\nUsing the same time period above compare the organic performance of individual pages. This will help you understand which pages have drops. You can then compare the pages that improved or stayed strong with the ones that dropped. If you're getting less organic traffic across all of your pages you might have a bigger technical problem.\n2. Check your website's rankings\nChecking rankings in Google Search Console is a way to cross reference your organic visits. However, with so much SEO personalization going on with individual keyword positions along with localization it's difficult to check individual keyword rankings with a high degree of confidence. However, if you notice your website has dropped in rankings for keywords that you previously ranked well for, this could be a sign of a penalty.\n3. Look for new messages in Google Search Console.\nThis should probably be number one on the list but it's a pretty boring recommendation. If you see any new messages from Google, it may contain information on a penalty or other issue. If you have received a manual penalty from Google, it will be listed in the Manual Actions section of your Search Console account. If you're not setup in Google Search Console you can contact as and we'll help you get setup. This is what the message looks like. google penalty notice\n\n4. Check if any pages or content have been removed from Google.\nIf you find any pages or content have been removed from Google's index, this could be a sign of a penalty or an issue with your site. \n\nEnsure that pages or sites aren't noindexed. We've even seen websites hacked and the only change was noindexing the site! You can use a Chrome extension that we developed to called Noindex Alerter. The extension creates a Google Chrome Notification if you visit a website that is issuing a noindex directive through an X-Robots-Tag, a robots.txt disallow, and or a meta tag noindex. This extension is meant for QA'ing websites and not for using for regular browsing. You can easily turn it on and off. We encourage our team to use it after"},{"id":30,"__component":"blocks.faq","sectionTitle":"Google Penalty FAQs","sectionContent":"We've seen it all when it comes to Google knocking down businesses online. From manual beat downs, to coordinated social driven SEO attacks, to algorithmic adjustments that crush a site. ","ctaReference":null,"contactForm":null,"faqs":{"data":[{"id":23,"attributes":{"question":"How do I get my website to rank higher in Google?","answer":"To get your website to rank higher in Google, a number of different SEO strategies can be employed, and these different approaches should all be pursued in combination for best results. First, you should ensure that there are no immediate severe issues like manual penalties or delisting; these can be checked through tools like Google Safe Browsing and Google Search Console. If nothing requires fixing, then SEO involves improving your site in a number of areas: content quality, technical SEO, and offsite SEO. Content quality involves the material posted on your site: ensuring that it is original rather than copied from elsewhere, valuable and relevant to your visitors, and contains your targeted keywords. Technical SEO involves ensuring that your site is functioning properly: that your pages load quickly and are accessible from different platforms including mobile devices, that your navigation links are functional and not broken, and that Google’s crawlers aren’t blocked by your robots.txt file. Offsite SEO involves acquiring natural backlinks from other high-authority sites relevant to your industry and obtaining positive reviews from customers.","createdAt":"2023-09-08T20:24:37.805Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:09:49.460Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-08T20:24:45.624Z","category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","createdAt":"2023-03-10T01:20:02.464Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:20:01.609Z"}}}}},{"id":24,"attributes":{"question":"How do we increase Google organic search traffic?","answer":"You can increase Google organic search traffic to your site by following good SEO practices. Here are five basic SEO tips. One, have a strategy to generate natural backlinks from high-quality, high-authority sites relevant to your industry. (Do not pay for links, as this is a spammy practice that is penalized by Google). Two, create unique and original website content. Sites hosting unique content are more likely considered high-quality by Google than ones which simply recycle material that is readily available elsewhere. (Of course, it should also be useful and relevant to your users). Three, make sure your site is mobile-friendly. As mobile devices are responsible for an increasing number of searches, Google is increasingly prioritizing it as a ranking factor. Mobile-friendliness includes such factors as having responsive design to display on different screen sizes and loading quickly even for less-powerful computers. Four, include relevant keywords in your content to optimize it for search. Including long-tail keywords in your content can target more specific queries, while placing keywords in important positions like titles elevates their importance. Five, make sure your site is secured by an SSL certificate. Security is a Google ranking factor, with https sites ranking higher than http ones. Beyond these five tips, further information on how to improve your website to meet Google’s standards can be found in Google’s webmaster guidelines.","createdAt":"2023-09-08T20:25:05.113Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:04:58.772Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-08T20:25:14.706Z","category":{"data":{"id":16,"attributes":{"name":"Website Penalities","slug":"website-penalties","createdAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z"}}}}},{"id":95,"attributes":{"question":"What is blacklist SEO attack?","answer":"A blacklist SEO attack is when a malicious actor hacks a website to subvert it for their own ends. This might involve phishing to collect personal information such as passwords or bank account details from visitors, or installing malware on the computers of visitors, or redirecting visitors to their own websites. In order to protect users, Google places warnings on such compromised pages, advising visitors not to proceed. You can check whether your website’s URL has been blacklisted using such Google Safe Browsing. If it has, you can request Google restore it by re-securing it and removing any malware (either yourself or with the help of a professional service) and then submitting your website for reassessment on Google Search Console.

However, such backlinks must be built and acquired naturally; paying for backlinks is against Google’s webmaster guidelines and may result in your site being penalized.

Unlike positive keywords, which trigger your site to be delivered to a searcher when they match the users query, negative keywords cause your site to not be delivered to searches which include those keywords. For instance, if you are selling Apple computer products, adding “fruit” as a negative keyword to your ads will prevent them from being delivered to searchers looking for the food rather than the electronics brand. The reason you may wish to do this when paying for Google Ads is that you are charged for clicks, meaning that every result delivered by mistake to a searcher it’s not relevant to costs you money. The use of negative keywords in SEO for organic search results is a more difficult matter, as you can include positive keywords in your content, but there is no way to make a list of negative keywords. The most you can do is to deliberately avoid including any phrases you deem to be negative keywords in the content on your site. The impact of this is much less significant than it is for paid advertisements, as you do not pay a cost for mistaken organic clicks, but it may improve certain metrics like conversion rate by reducing the amount of mistaken traffic to your site.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:33:55.083Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:05:26.408Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:33:59.976Z","category":{"data":{"id":16,"attributes":{"name":"Website Penalities","slug":"website-penalties","createdAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z"}}}}},{"id":100,"attributes":{"question":"What is offsite SEO?","answer":"Offsite SEO factors are anything that contributes to how your website is ranked by Google that is not hosted on your website itself.

Applying to resource pages means submitting your site to curated lists of high-quality links relevant to your industry. Broken link building means finding pages about subjects relevant to your business which have broken links and contacting their site owners offering to let them redirect the links from the now-missing page to a page offering similar content on your own site. Skyscraper link building refers to finding successful content, creating similar but even better content on your own site, and then promoting that page to those who linked to the original content. Finally, reporters often include a links to sources that provide them with information for news pieces, which can be a valuable source of high-authority backlinks from widely-viewed pages.

Site search will cause Google to look at only pages on that specific domain; for further specificity, enclosing the keywords in quotation marks will cause Google to search only for exact word-for-word matches. This will show all pages on the site on which the keywords appear. To look for all occurrences of a keyword on one specific page, open the page in HTML by right-clicking on a blank part of the page and selecting “View page source”, then hold Ctrl+F (Windows) or Command+F (Mac) and type the keyword you are looking for. This will highlight each occurrence of the word in the page’s source code, as well as displaying a counter of how many times the word appears on the page overall and arrows allowing you to jump between occurrences.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:41:24.459Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T17:41:34.370Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:41:33.898Z","category":{"data":null}}},{"id":108,"attributes":{"question":"How does YouTube rank videos?","answer":"YouTube ranks its videos based on several factors including relevant keywords, user engagement, tagging, categorization, and hash tagging. Relevant keywords refers to terms relevant to a user’s search which are included in the video’s title and description; the better a match to the terms the user is searching for, the more highly it will rank. Engagement refers to how long viewers watch your video; people watching it all the way through indicates to YouTube that they find it useful and it is a good result to display to searchers, while people immediately abandoning it indicates that it is not what they were looking for and should not be ranked as highly. Tagging refers to how the video is tagged; such tags not only inform users what the video is about, but also helps YouTube’s algorithm understand the content and context of the video. While good tags can boost a video’s visibility, irrelevant or inaccurate ones can result in it being penalized. Categorization refers to choosing a category for a video so YouTube can group it with similar content; this influences which playlists and recommendations it ends up in. Hash tagging refers to using hashtags in a video’s description to increase its discoverability.

If nothing requires fixing, then SEO involves improving your site in a number of areas: content quality, technical SEO, and offsite SEO. Content quality involves the material posted on your site: ensuring that it is original rather than copied from elsewhere, valuable and relevant to your visitors, and contains your targeted keywords. Technical SEO involves ensuring that your site is functioning properly: that your pages load quickly and are accessible from different platforms including mobile devices, that your navigation links are functional and not broken, and that Google’s crawlers aren’t blocked by your robots.txt file.

Here are five basic SEO tips. One, have a strategy to generate natural backlinks from high-quality, high-authority sites relevant to your industry. (Do not pay for links, as this is a spammy practice that is penalized by Google). Two, create unique and original website content. Sites hosting unique content are more likely considered high-quality by Google than ones which simply recycle material that is readily available elsewhere. (Of course, it should also be useful and relevant to your users). Three, make sure your site is mobile-friendly. As mobile devices are responsible for an increasing number of searches, Google is increasingly prioritizing it as a ranking factor. Mobile-friendliness includes such factors as having responsive design to display on different screen sizes and loading quickly even for less-powerful computers. Four, include relevant keywords in your content to optimize it for search. Including long-tail keywords in your content can target more specific queries, while placing keywords in important positions like titles elevates their importance. Five, make sure your site is secured by an SSL certificate. Security is a Google ranking factor, with https sites ranking higher than http ones. Beyond these five tips, further information on how to improve your website to meet Google’s standards can be found in Google’s webmaster guidelines.","createdAt":"2023-09-08T20:25:05.113Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:04:58.772Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-08T20:25:14.706Z","category":{"data":{"id":16,"attributes":{"name":"Website Penalities","slug":"website-penalties","createdAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z"}}}}},{"id":101,"attributes":{"question":"How many clicks should I be getting from organic search?","answer":"Typically, the amount of clicks one should be receiving from organic search is measured not in terms of absolute number of clicks, but rather in click-through rate (CTR): the percentage of people who see your site in the search results that click on it.

However, due to advances in machine learning and natural language processing, stop words no longer pose as much of a problem to modern search engines, and Google’s John Mueller has stated that site owners should write naturally without worrying about stop words.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:43:25.499Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:19:34.036Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:43:29.718Z","category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","createdAt":"2023-03-10T01:20:02.464Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:20:01.609Z"}}}}},{"id":110,"attributes":{"question":"Does the level of confidence between the geography of the user and the page matter for SEO?","answer":"\"Yes, the level of confidence between the geography of the user and the page can matter for SEO, as search engines like Google aim to provide users with the most relevant and useful search results based on their location.

Make sure to include accurate and up-to-date information, such as your business address, phone number, and hours of operation.\n\nOnline reviews: Encourage customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google Maps or Yelp, as this can help improve your local search rankings.\n\nLocal backlinks: Acquiring backlinks from other local websites can help signal to search engines that your content is relevant to users in that area.\n\nSchema markup: Implementing structured data markup, such as LocalBusiness schema, can help search engines understand your business's location and other details.\n\nWhile the geography of the user and the page does matter for SEO, it is essential to strike a balance between localized content and broader, more general content to ensure your website appeals to both local and non-local users.\"","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:44:12.596Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:19:24.706Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:44:28.595Z","category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","createdAt":"2023-03-10T01:20:02.464Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:20:01.609Z"}}}}},{"id":111,"attributes":{"question":"Does continuous time spent on site matter?","answer":"Yes, the user-averaged active continuous time spent by a user (in seconds) on host pages after clicking on a query from a search engine.","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:45:00.572Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:07:22.498Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:45:08.170Z","category":{"data":{"id":16,"attributes":{"name":"Website Penalities","slug":"website-penalties","createdAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z"}}}}},{"id":97,"attributes":{"question":"Do user interactions on a page matter?","answer":"The average number of active actions (clicks, keystrokes) for users when the user is continuously on the host pages after clicking on a request from a search engine (the factor depends on the pair (request,domAttr)).","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:33:09.889Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:09:24.829Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:33:15.491Z","category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","createdAt":"2023-03-10T01:20:02.464Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:20:01.609Z"}}}}},{"id":102,"attributes":{"question":"Do the number of visits to a site that are not from links matter?","answer":"Yes, percentage of visits to the site not by links (typed by hand or from bookmarks","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:35:03.282Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T18:10:36.287Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:35:09.603Z","category":{"data":{"id":16,"attributes":{"name":"Website Penalities","slug":"website-penalties","createdAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T18:34:49.056Z"}}}}},{"id":112,"attributes":{"question":"What happens if I get a burst of clicks from search in a short period of time?","answer":"URL feature computed from rapid clicks spy_log counters with decay of 3 days, URL feature computed from rapid clicks spy_log counters with decay of 14 days","createdAt":"2023-09-09T17:46:40.714Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-09T17:46:45.854Z","publishedAt":"2023-09-09T17:46:45.709Z","category":{"data":null}}}]}},{"id":51,"__component":"blocks.long-form-content","htmlAndMarkupContent":"## ChartGPT Ranking Factors \n- ChatGPT Bing \u0026 Bard, search engine rankings are derived by the best answer that OpenAI, Bing, or Google determines.
