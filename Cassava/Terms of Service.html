    <div class="block">
      When we say "platform" in this document, we are referring to your integration wtih Cassava which includes Slack and Microsoft Teams.

      We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our <a href="https://gocassava.com/blog">company blog</a> and/or the dashboard.

      When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. <b>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</b>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about <a href="https://gocassava.com/about">who we are</a>, and keeping an open mind to your feedback.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. Cassava cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (even by others who have their own logins under your account).
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

In the case of Microsoft Teams you can install our app directly via the App directory without invoking OAuth. Email based registration is also possible via a Magic Link.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.

      <h1 class="title is-4 is-spaced">Payment, refunds, upgrading and downgrading terms</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          When you register with Cassava, you are automatically enrolled in our free plan. We do not ask for your credit card and we do not sell your data. Accounts on the free plan with extended periods of no publishing activity are subject to closure at our discretion.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          At anytime you may choose to upgrade from the free plan to a paid one. When you do so directly on Cassava, we will request your credit card and other billing information and charge you immediately. Your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade and recurrs monthly. Payments are made via <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>. You can refer to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information. Subscriptions which are purchased via our external partner platforms are managed therein.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle and the change is prorated. Downgrading your plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. Cassava does not accept any liability for such loss.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. The subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each term for a term of equal length, without prior notice, unless and until canceled by you, or it is terminated by us. The subscription must be canceled before it renews to avoid billing of the next term’s subscription fees.
          <br />
          <br />
          For those who transact via the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace you can find more information at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/refund-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refund policies for Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace</a>.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation of a paid subscription. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account under your Billing Information section of the website. We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation button.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          If you cancel your subscription before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. Your access remains as is until the end of the current billing cycle. No partial refunds are given.

        <div class="block">
          We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services.

          We design our services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback.

          We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free services.
