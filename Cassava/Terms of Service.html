    </div>

    <div class="block">
      If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.

      <h1 class="title is-4 is-spaced">Payment, refunds, upgrading and downgrading terms</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          When you register with Cassava, you are automatically enrolled in our free plan. We do not ask for your credit card and we do not sell your data. Accounts on the free plan with extended periods of no publishing activity are subject to closure at our discretion.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          At anytime you may choose to upgrade from the free plan to a paid one. When you do so directly on Cassava, we will request your credit card and other billing information and charge you immediately. Your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade and recurrs monthly. Payments are made via <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>. You can refer to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information. Subscriptions which are purchased via our external partner platforms are managed therein.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle and the change is prorated. Downgrading your plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. Cassava does not accept any liability for such loss.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. The subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each term for a term of equal length, without prior notice, unless and until canceled by you, or it is terminated by us. The subscription must be canceled before it renews to avoid billing of the next term’s subscription fees.
          <br />
          <br />
          For those who transact via the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace you can find more information at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/refund-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refund policies for Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace</a>.

        <div class="block">
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation of a paid subscription. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account under your Billing Information section of the website. We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation button.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          If you cancel your subscription before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. Your access remains as is until the end of the current billing cycle. No partial refunds are given.
