    <h2 class="subtitle is-6"><em>Last updated: June 17, 2024</em></h2>

    <div class="block">
      The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise to never sell your data.
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      When we say "company", "we", "our, "us", "Cassava", "application", "bot", "service" or "services" in this document, we are referring to Cassavarose LLC.
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      When we say "platform" in this document, we are referring to your integrations wtih Cassava which includes Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Webex.
    </div>

    <!-- section -->

    <div class="block">
      <h1 class="title is-4 is-spaced">What we collect and why</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need and that we will solely process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection, data privacy and security standards. We only share information with them that is required for the services offered.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          Here’s what all this means in practice:
        </div>
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h1 class="title is-5 is-spaced">Identity & Access</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          When you register for an account with Cassava, we request access to your platform and identity via OAuth or via direct installation by means of the App directory. Your platform provides one or more tokens to facilitate this process.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          As part of registration, we obtain the bare minimum information regarding your account to allow us to authenticate and authorize your use of Cassava. We collect your platform id, platform name, platform tokens, and scopes during authentication. During authorization we also collect your name, platform user id, user tokens, scopes, profile photo where available, as well as your locale and timezone when provided.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          At any time you can invite members of your platform to collaborate on your Cassava Experiences, and in doing so we ask them to identify themselves by signing in to the platform. People outside your organization can also be invited to collaborate by providing a personal email address in exchange for a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-passwordless-authentication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Link</a> token.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          The purpose of self identification in each case is so that we can authenticate and authorize your use of Cassava. We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission.
        </div>
      </h2>

      <h1 class="title is-5 is-spaced">Billing Information</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
        When you directly purchase a recurring subscription to Cassava on our platform, we ask for your credit card and other billing information, so that we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. We use <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a> as our payment processor and as such your credit card is passed directly to them from your browser and never goes through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number for account history, invoicing, and billing support.

          <b>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug which impacts your use of Cassava</b>. When you reach out to us for assistance in this matter you implicitly grant us the right to review your account to support debugging the issue.

        <div class="block">
          <b>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses</b>. Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <b>To support coaching facilitations</b>. We share limited details of your organization's members with coaches. This allows the coach to identify audience participants.

      <h1 class="title is-4 is-spaced">Your rights with respect to your information</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">
        <div class="block">
          At Cassava, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Cassava recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Know.</b> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right of Access.</b> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Correction.</b> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.</b> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Casava services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Complain.</b> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Restrict Processing.</b> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never will sell your personal data.)
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Object.</b> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Portability.</b> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</b> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <b>Right to Non-Discrimination.</b> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at privacy@gocassava.com. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.
