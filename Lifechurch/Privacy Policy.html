<p>Life.Church launched in 1996 launch in a two-car garage. Since then, we&rsquo;ve become recognized for our use of technology to spread the Gospel. We began using video teaching in our services in 2001, were one of the first churches to offer online church in 2006, launched the Bible App in 2008, and more.</p>

<p>Our place at the forefront of digital ministry is driven by our passion to see technology leveraged to help people find hope, peace, and joy in Christ. The Life.Church app and our websites are tools we offer to serve our attenders by connecting them to one another and equipping them to become fully devoted followers of Christ.</p>

<p>Life.Church is also passionate about serving pastors and church leaders around the world to help build the &ldquo;capital C&rdquo; Church. Through Life.Church Open Network, leaders can download free resources, and trainings to reach more people.</p>

We develop these tools as an act of ministry to serve you, and you have choices in your experience. You choose what you access, what you share, and with whom. Your data is yours. Life.Church does not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.</p>

We create user profiles for offline purposes as well, which include volunteerism and inquiries concerning employment. We may combine the information you provide us for your profile and interactions with our sites with information you provide us through other Life.Church sites, services, and products and inferences we make from the same for our internal development to improve the overall quality of our sites, services, and products. We may also make recommendations to you for other Life.Church services based on the information you provide and we infer.</p>

<p><strong>Your Posts</strong></p>

<p>Our Life.Church sites have a wide array of functionality, including streaming video, creating prayer requests, and identifying and communicating with your Life.Church groups and teams. Some Life.Church sites may also allow you to publish, distribute, and display content to specific individuals or the public. We will refer to how you provide content and information as &ldquo;posted&rdquo; and the content and information posted as &ldquo;user contributions.&rdquo; User contributions may be made on public areas of websites and social media accounts you access through our sites or may otherwise be transmitted to third parties. Your user contributions are processed by us to facilitate your ability to create, use, store, and distribute user contributions as you choose. We will associate your user contributions with your account if you opt not to delete them.</p>

<p>If you disclose personal information, whether through collaborative postings, social media, message boards, or otherwise, this information may be collected and used by others. User contributions are posted and transmitted at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you choose to share your user contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will not view your user contributions, nor do we accept any liability associated with your user contributions.</p>

<p><strong>Giving</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to provide a donation through one of the Life.Church sites, then and only then will you be prompted and required to provide credit card, bank account, and other financial information necessary to process the transaction. We will collect the designation for your donation if you provide one, and personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and/or email address to ensure that your donation is used for the purpose you request and to provide you with an annual giving statement that itemizes your donation(s). We will also contact you periodically to inquire if you would like to give to another program, location, or cause. We may contact you through push notification, email, mail, or in-app messages to share these opportunities.</p>

<p>This information, excluding your financial information, is stored in our CRM system. As of the date of this Policy, we use Stripe to process your online donation payments.

We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.

We use cookies to identify you and log your use. When you access or leave our sites, we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to next. We also get information about your IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, and/or ISP or your mobile carrier.

We do not share any of your personally identifiable information, device identification, or location without your explicit permission. We advertise on third-party sites such as Facebook and Google and use third-party software development kits (&ldquo;SDKs&rdquo;) to attribute a download of a Life.Church application on to the advertisement placed on the third-party site. We do not sell your personal information to any third parties, allow our SDK service providers to sell your personal information to third parties, or use your personal information to solicit the sale of third-party goods or services. We may provide these third parties with aggregate de-identified information concerning ads placed on their sites and downloads that result from those ads.</p>\n\n<p>We use this information to provide a tailored Life.Church site experience for you and to communicate with you more effectively. The information is also collected to determine the aggregate number of unique devices using our sites, track total usage, and analyze usage data to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. We may combine this information with other information to provide you with a better experience and improve the quality of our service. If you do not want us to collect this information, you should cease use of our sites.</p>\n\n<p>We generally maintain the data we collect from cookies for 21 days but may save it for longer when necessary, such as when required by law or for technical reasons. Although most internet browsers accept cookies by default, you can control cookies through your browser settings and similar tools or agree to refuse all cookies altogether. If you refuse to accept cookies, you may prohibit Life.Church from delivering the full capability of our sites, and you may prevent the use of certain features and services that require these technologies.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot regulate other sites, content, or applications of third parties. They may place their cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based, targeted content. We do not control these third parties&rsquo; tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about targeted content, contact the responsible provider directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WiFi and GPS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of our sites use GPS or wireless (&ldquo;WiFi&rdquo;) information to identify when you are near one of our physical locations.

If you provide consent, we use the information to enable push notifications related to interactions with our Life.Church sites and physical locations.</p>\n\n<p>You also have the ability to manually initiate a location search to identify whether you are at one of our physical locations. When using certain Life.Church sites, you can provide us with your location through your browser, zip code, or city, which a third-party search engine will process. We do not store GPS and WiFi information outside of your device. Once your particular session of use of the feature ends, we will cease to have access to your GPS and WiFi location unless you use the feature again.</p>\n\n<p>After your first use of this functionality and consent for us to use your GPS or WiFi location, we will assume we have consent unless you revoke it through your mobile device&rsquo;s settings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Life.Church Content</strong></p>\n\n<p>We collect how you use the content available through our sites and the language you choose to utilize that content.
