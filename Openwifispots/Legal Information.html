    <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
    <br />
    <span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #696969">Effective January 1st 2010<br />
    <br />
    </span>OpenWiFiSpots is an online application that helps people find free wifi hotspots. To accomplish this, people write
    comments and reviews about locations that are posted to OpenWiFiSpots. These
    comments and reviews can then be accessed and read by anyone visiting this site.
    For the purposes of this Privacy notice, a "user" is defined as someone using the
    OpenWiFiSpots Site.<br />
    <br />
    By using OpenWiFiSpots, you permit the collection and use of your personal information,
    although extremely limited in nature as outlined below in our Privacy notice. You
    should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy notice.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br />
    In order for OpenWiFiSpots to work properly we log your browser-type related
    information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br />
    Information such as your full name and any personally identifiable information you
    have included in your comments and reviews may be shown to other users in conjunction
    with comments and reviews you have contributed.<br />
    <br />
    Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and
    timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer OpenWiFiSpots,
    and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition,
    we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics
    in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to
    inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have
    been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising links.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Transfer of Information</strong><br />
    We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information.
    OpenWiFiSpots will disclose information about individual users to governmental
    or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or
    entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further,
    OpenWiFiSpots may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
    action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the
    terms and conditions of this Privacy notice.<br />
    <br />
    We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer
    of ownership of OpenWiFiSpots, such as an acquisition by or merger with another
    company. In such an event, OpenWiFiSpots will notify you before information about
    you is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy notice.<br />
    <br />
    OpenWiFiSpots will notify you when information about you may be provided to third
    parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent
    such information sharing.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Links</strong><br />
    Our Website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation.
    OpenWiFiSpots does not share your personal information with those Websites and
    is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy
    polices on these third party Websites.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br />
    Like most Websites, OpenWiFiSpots requires cookies to function properly. Cookies
    are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique
    user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. You should
    be aware that OpenWiFiSpots cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or
    any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not
    want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure
    in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however,
    you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features available
    on the OpenWiFiSpots site.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Controlling Your Personal Information</strong><br />
    You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information
    (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via comments and reviews, messages, forums, postings,
    or in other areas of the OpenWiFiSpots site, that information, along with any
    substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated
    and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters
    or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of OpenWiFiSpots. Please
    do not post any personal information on the OpenWiFiSpots site or in other areas
    that you expect to keep private.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Third-Party Advertising</strong>
    <br />
    We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information 
    (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to 
    provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=94149" target="_blank">click here.</a><br />
    <br />
    <strong>Security</strong><br />
    OpenWiFiSpots tries very hard to protect our users' information. We use industry
    standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database.
    We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform
    their job function. If you have any questions about the security at our Website,
    please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized
    disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information
    that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
    Privacy notice.<br />
    <br />
    You hereby acknowledge that OpenWiFiSpots is not responsible for any intercepted
    information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims
    arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized
    manner.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Children</strong><br />
    This Website is not directed to children, and OpenWiFiSpots does not knowingly
