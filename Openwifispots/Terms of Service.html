    The Site may automatically produce search results that reference or link to third-party
    sites throughout the World Wide Web. OpenWiFiSpots has no control over these sites
    or the content within them. OpenWiFiSpots cannot guarantee, represent, or warrant
    that the content contained in these sites is accurate, legal, and/or inoffensive.
    OpenWiFiSpots does not endorse the content of any third-party site, nor do we
    warrant that it will not contain viruses or otherwise impact your computer. By using
    the Site to search for or link to another site, you agree and understand that you
    may not make any claim against OpenWiFiSpots for any damages or losses, whatsoever,
    resulting from your use of the Site to obtain search results or to link to another
    site. If you have a problem with a link from the Site, please notify OpenWiFiSpots
    at <a href="mailto:info@openwifispots.com">info@openwifispots.com</a>, and OpenWiFiSpots will investigate your claim and
    take any actions OpenWiFiSpots deems appropriate at our sole discretion.
    <br />
    <br />
    Business listings located on OpenWiFiSpots are selected for display in search
    results based primarily on their content in relation to the user-provided search
    terms. Consequently, both customer and non-customer listings will be included in
    a search results list, and OpenWiFiSpots will not discriminate based on whether
    a business is a customer with regard to placement or inclusion in the business listings.
    OpenWiFiSpots customers do not pay to be included in certain search result listings
    or to retain a specific ranking unless they are specifically participating in various
    advertising programs wich are labeled as such.<br />
    <br />
    OpenWiFiSpots customer listings may be rotated within the search results due to
    a number of factors, none of which are determined by paid inclusion or paid placement.
    Thus, such variable placement of OpenWiFiSpots customers is not intended to displace
    non-customer search results placement or inclusion. Indeed, non-customers with a
    good deal of quality content could appear higher on search result returns than OpenWiFiSpots
    customers.<br />
    <br />
