<h3>9. Notice to EU Residents under the ”GDPR” </h3>

<p>

</p>

<strong>
    Personal Data

<p>
    The GDPR, defines “personal data” as “…any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”

</p>

<p>
    For the purposes of our Privacy Policy, the “data subject” is “you” (“your”, “user”). The personal data we collect may include: the unique User ID we assign you.

</p>

<p>
    We do not directly collect your IP address. We opted to protect our users and use one-way encryption of IP addresses in a way that does not allow for it to be associated with any person nor linked to any other information we may have.
</p>

<p>
    The personal data we collect will only be used and disclosed for the purposes detailed in sections 5 and 6 to this Privacy Policy.

</p>

<p>
    Our basis for processing personal data: GDPR Article 6.1(a): “the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes”; GDPR Article 6.1(b): “processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract”; GDPR Article 6(1)(f): “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party…”
</p>

<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Please note that we can only meet sufficiently verifiable user requests.</span>
    Sufficiently verifiable user requests refer to requests that allow us to reasonably match the information provided by the user making the request with the information already available with us,
    insofar non-pseudonymous Personal Data is available.
</p>

<p>
    In view of the above, and due to opting to use one-way encryption for IPs, in pseudonymous manner, we may not have any personal information of you on record we can provide you with.
</p>

<h3>10. Notice to California Residents under the ”CCPA” </h3>

<p>
    This Section applies to you if you are a natural person who is a California resident, as defined in the California Code of Regulations. This section describes our good faith effort to meet our obligations under the CCPA.

</p>

</p>
<p>

    there is no need for you to opt-out of the potential sale of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Please note that we can only meet sufficiently verifiable user requests.</span>
    Sufficiently verifiable user requests refer to requests that allow us to reasonably match the information provided by the user making the request with the information already available with us,
    insofar non-pseudonymous Personal Data is available.
</p>
<p>
    In view of the above, and due to opting to use one-way encryption for IPs, in pseudonymous manner, we may not have any personal information of you on record we can provide you with.
</p>
