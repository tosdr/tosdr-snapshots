<p>We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to Users via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by us at our discretion.

<h3>8.	Interesting.com's Agent to Receive Notification of Copyright Infringement Claims</h3>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material posted on Internet sites infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that items, information or other materials appearing on the Website infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Interesting.com's Designated Agent a notice requesting that the item, information or material be removed, or access to it blocked.</p>
<p>You can contact Interesting.com's Designated Agent at: Interesting.com, Inc., 282 Katonah Avenue, #1082, Katonah, NY 10536, info-at-wikitree-dot-com (remove the hyphens and convert "at" to "@" and "dot" to ".").</p>
<p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. One place to find more information is the U.S. Copyright Office web site, currently located at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/</a>. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be substantial penalties for false claims.</p>
