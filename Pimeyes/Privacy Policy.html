<p><strong>3. Data collected in PimEyes’ index:</strong></p>
<p>PimEyes, akin to conventional search engines, provides a service to the User by utilising its unique index. Specifically, the search engine indexes &quot;fingerprints&quot; of faces found on the Internet with the sole purpose of facilitating future searches. PimEyes does not engage in targeted searches for any particular individual, but rather indexes images that are openly available on the Internet, along with corresponding data about their respective sources. Notably, PimEyes does not undertake any action to confirm the identities of the persons depicted in the indexed photos, whom this policy refers to as &quot;unidentified entities.&quot;</p>
<p>In pursuit of creating an index that relies on publicly available sources, PimEyes processes the indexed data. The objective is to provide a high-quality service to Users in the future.</p>
<p>When presenting the search results, PimEyes employs a secure on-the-fly process, also known as a proxy, to download and display images from external websites. These images are stored for a temporary period not exceeding 30 calendar days and are instantaneously deleted upon being exhibited.</p>
<p>Data which is processed in the PimEyes index stems from sources that are publicly accessible. During the collection of such data, PimEyes abides by the distinct regulations of each website accessed by PimEyesBot web robots and only downloads data from sites which officially allow data scrapping.</p>
<p>PimEyes presents images from external websites, but the content exhibited therein is not within its purview. Nevertheless, PimEyes exerts every effort to cull explicit or pornographic content or have it obscured.</p>

<h2>SPECIFIC NOTICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
<p>As a California resident, it is important to note that certain legal guidelines, as well as extra consumer rights, are provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). It is essential for individuals to abide by these regulations for the protection of their personal data.</p>
<p><em>Please note, that according to the CCPA:</em></p>
<p>“Personal data” means data that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, for example real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers, but also biometric data.</p>
<p>A California resident, who is a natural person is referred to as a &quot;Consumer&quot;.</p>
<p>A &quot;Household&quot; is a collective, identified by their residential address, of Consumers who reside together and make use of shared devices or services.</p>
<p>Consumer has the following additional rights regarding the Personal data:</p>
<h3>1. Upon a verifiable consumer request :</h3>
<p><strong>a)</strong>  A Consumer has the right, to know what Personal Data is being collected by PimEyes. In order to exercise this right, a Consumer must make a verifiable request and, upon successfully verifying the request, PimEyes will provide the Consumer with the relevant data :</p>
<p>• Categories of Personal data PimEyes has collected about that Consumer,</p>
<p>• Categories of sources from which the Personal data is collected,</p>
<p>• Business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing Personal data,</p>
<p>• Categories of third parties to whom PimEyes discloses Personal data,</p>
<p>• Specific pieces of Personal data PimEyes has collected about that specific Consumer.</p>
<p><em>The data supplied by PimEyes will be restricted to the past twelve months.</em></p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Right to access Personal data;</p>
<p>In order to fulfil this obligation, the Consumer should submit a verifiable request and upon successful verification, PimEyes will promptly disclose and provide the Personal data requested, at no charge to the Consumer. The data may be delivered by mail or electronically and if provided electronically, the data shall be in a portable and to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format, that allows the Consumer to transmit this data to another entity, without hindrance.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Right to request the deletion of Personal data;</p>
<p>To fulfil the right for consumers to delete some or all of their Personal data, after verification of the request, PimEyes will delete the data, with allowances for any exceptions that result from the California Consumer Privacy Act. If an exception applies, FRA informs you about it in writing.</p>
<p>According to CCPA “Verifiable Consumer Request” is a request, that is made by a Consumer, by a Consumer on behalf of the Consumer’s minor child, by a natural person or a person registered with the Secretary of State. Authorised by the Consumer, to act on the Consumer’s behalf, or by a person who has power of attorney or is acting as a conservator for the Consumer, and that PimEyes can verify, using commercially reasonable methods.</p>
<p>PimEyes shall provide the necessary data to a Consumer without any cost within 45 days of effectively receiving a Verifiable Consumer Request. On legitimate grounds, an extension of 45 more days can be allowed with the Consumer being duly notified of the delay during the initial 45-day period. When there is a need to address the complexity and quantity of the requests, the duration to respond to any Verified Consumer Request could potentially be extended by a further 90 days. PimEyes will advise the Consumer of such an expansion and the reasons for such a postponement within 45 days of receipt of the request, all in a professional manner.</p>
<p><strong>Verifiable Consumer Request :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To ensure accurate identification of the Consumer, it is necessary to collect the Consumer's e-mail address, a face photo, and in the event a request is submitted to access their data, a copy of the Consumer's identity document with the appropriate photo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are representing a Consumer, it is in your best interest to provide PimEyes with appropriate documentation verifying your authority to act on behalf of the Consumer. PimEyes has the right to request authorisation from the Consumer before proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you act as a household, PimEyes will require all Consumers constituting the household to submit the request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifiable Consumer Request can be made by sending an email containing, respectively, all necessary elements described above to the following email address: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d626b6b646e684d7d64606874687e236e6260"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c8a7aeaea1abad88b8a1a5adb1adbbe6aba7a5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<h3>2. Right to opt-out the sale of Personal data.</h3>
<p>CCPA provides the Consumers with a right to opt-out the sale of Personal data. PimEyes provides the Users only with the search results, i.e., does not sell and declares that it does not intend to sell Personal data in the future. However, if you don’t want to appear in search results, you have a right to submit a request to exercise the opt-out right to have any and all of your data removed from the PimEyes system. The opt-out form is available here: <a href="https://pimeyes.com/en/opt-out-request-form">opt-out form</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Right to non-discrimination,</h3>
<p>PimEyes does not discriminate against a Consumer, because the Consumer exercised any of the Consumer’s rights under CCPA, including, but not limited to, by:</p>
<p>• Denying goods or services to the Consumer.</p>
<p>• Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</p>
<p>• Providing different level or quality of goods or services to the Consumer</p>
<p>• The Consumer may receive a differing cost or rate for the same goods or services, or they may receive a different quality or standard of them.</p>
<h3>4. Consumers have the right to request the removal of all their data from the PimEyes system, by filling out <a href="https://pimeyes.com/en/opt-out-request-form">opt-out form</a>.</h3>
<p>PimEyes recognises its responsibility as outlined in the California Code of Civil Procedure (CIV § 1798.83) and asserts that they do not transfer or disclose Personal details to third parties for marketing orders. Therefore, PimEyes does not have any specific procedure for processing requests in relation to these matters.</p>
