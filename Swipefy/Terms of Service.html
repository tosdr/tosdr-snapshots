        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
          that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
          the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
          and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app
          itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to
          it, still belong to Swipefy LLC.</p>
        <p>Swipefy LLC is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
          we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
          We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
          paying for.</p>
        <p>The Swipefy app stores and processes personal data
          that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access
          to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process
          of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
          could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
          features and it could mean that the Swipefy app won’t
          work properly or at all.</p>
        <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">AdMob</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>Swipefy LLC will have the right to "ban" (permanently disable login access) any user from the platform at any
          time without prior notice.</p>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Swipefy LLC will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
          or provided by your mobile network provider, but Swipefy LLC cannot take responsibility for the app not
          working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance
          left.</p>
        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
          with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
          for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges.
          In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
          use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you
          are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
          have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Swipefy LLC cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
          need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
          the Service, Swipefy LLC cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to Swipefy LLC’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
          important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we
          do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Swipefy LLC
          accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
          requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
          app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Swipefy LLC
          does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
          Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
          updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
          use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
          termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
          app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
        <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
          periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on
          this page.</p>
        <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2023-06-01</p>
