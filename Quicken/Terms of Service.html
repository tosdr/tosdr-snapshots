The term "<strong><em>Product</em></strong>" includes any Quicken branded software that we offer, as well as any related Products such as third-party software or apps that we make available to members. The term "<strong><em>Services</em></strong>" includes other functionality such as the ability to download data from third parties or the ability to pay bills from within a Product. In some cases, a third-party <strong><em>Supplier</em></strong> (such as a vendor) that is working on our behalf or other third party may provide Products or Services. The terms Product and Services do not apply to Quicken Simplifi or Estate Manager branded products and services which have their own Terms of Use which can be found <a href="https://www.quicken.com/simplifi/terms/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>The Membership Term.</strong> The <strong><em>Membership Term</em></strong> is the amount of time for which you have full rights to use the Products and Services. The Membership Term is generally one (1) year, but we may sometimes offer trial Memberships of shorter duration.

At the end of the Membership Term some features and functionality of our Products and Services will no longer be available to you. However, you will still have access to your data and limited Product functionality as defined under the <strong><em>Quicken Data Access Guarantee</em></strong> (below). </p>
<p><strong>Your Right to Use Products and Services.</strong> Your <strong><em>Membership</em></strong> gives you the right to use Products and Services. The exact combination of Products and Services that you may use will depend upon which Membership plan and platform you choose. Some plans or platforms may offer different functionality than other plans or platforms. The specific features, functionality, or capabilities of any Membership plan may be added to, altered, or removed at any time in response to customer Feedback, business or technology changes, market conditions, and the like. More information on the features available for each Membership plan is available at <a href="https://www.quicken.com/compare" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">quicken.com/compare</a>. </p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR CANADA USERS</strong> </p>
<p>In addition to the terms set forth above, the provisions of this section apply to the purchase of any Membership or Subscription and use of any Product or Service in Canada. </p>
<p>When you license a Product or Service on a subscription basis (referred to as a "<strong><em>Paid Subscription</em></strong>"), the Product or Service becomes immediately available to you once your initial payment is processed. Your Paid Subscription will continue for a period specified at the time of order. The Paid Subscription is paid in full in advance and you will be charged the applicable subscription price stated at the time of purchase as one lump sum, plus applicable taxes. Payments will be billed to you in Canadian dollars. When you purchase a Paid Subscription, it will renew automatically at the end of the applicable subscription period, and we will bill you for an additional subscription term at the then-current price unless the Paid Subscription is cancelled or terminated under this Agreement. If you do not wish your Paid Subscription to auto-renew, you may opt out of auto-renewal at any time before the end of your current subscription period. If you cancel your Paid Subscription within 30 days of the start date of your initial subscription period, you will receive a full refund. If you cancel more than 30 days after the start date of your initial subscription period, you will not be entitled to a refund on any remaining portion of your Paid Subscription and will continue to have access to the Product or Service until the end of your contracted term. Cancellation can be requested at any time by visiting your My Account page or by contacting our Customer Service Centre at 1 (650) 250-1900. If you cancel your Paid Subscription and you later decide to re-subscribe, you will be charged the then-current subscription price. </p>
