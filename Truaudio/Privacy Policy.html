We also may use your User Information to (1) understand how users access and use our Services on an aggregate and individualized basis, to improve the quality and design of our Services or Products, and to create new features, promotions, functionality and services by storing, tracking and analyzing user preferences and trends; (2) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use our Services; (3) provide you with custom, personalized content and information; (4) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; (5) track your use of our Services; (6) provide custom, personalized data analysis; (7) facilitate the provision of the updates to any Services or authenticate our Products; (8) verify compliance with this Policy; (9) manage job applications; and (10) perform other lawful businesses and commercial activities.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How We May Disclose Information. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose the information we collect related to the Services as follows, and BY USE OF THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO SUCH DISCLOSURE:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Usage Data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may provide Usage Data to our customers in connection with the Services which those customers use. For example, our customers may include network providers or operators and we may disclose Usage Data to these customers in connection with the products and devices that are deployed over these customers&rsquo; networks. The treatment of Usage Data by these third-parties is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this one. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those third parties.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Aggregate or De-identified Data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including Usage Data (such as anonymous or aggregate user usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, etc.), with certain third-parties to assist such third-parties in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services and/or functionality with respect to our Services. We may also share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third-parties for marketing, research, or similar purposes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Business Transfers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if substantially all of the assets of one of our business activities are transferred to another company, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may disclose certain User Information to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., with vendors that help us with delivering Products to you, including transaction processing and fraud prevention, vendors that help us maintain our Sites, or analytics providers) and may be located in other countries. These third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents perform technical operations such as database monitoring, data storage and hosting services and customer support software tools. These third parties may access, process or store Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing these services but based on our instructions only. If we receive Personally Identifiable Information subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Other Disclosures</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may also disclose User Information (1) if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is in compliance with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, copyright laws) or in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, search warrant or request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (2) if we believe, in good faith, such action is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or any terms applicable to specific Services, exercise our legal rights, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Services, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users or others; (3) to any parent company, affiliated entity, or other entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, us (in which case, we will require such entities to honor this Policy); or (4) as otherwise described herein.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Public Information. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that if you choose to share information about yourself in any discussion forum or public areas of our Services (such as the Community Forum, Stories, or review boards on the Soundvision Technologies Community) we consider that information to be public information. Any personal information that you include in any content submitted or posted when using the public areas of our Services can be viewed by the general public, so please consider this before submitting any such information or content. You are solely responsible for any information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, you disclose on the discussion or public areas of our Services, and any use of such information by any third-parties regardless of whether you permitted or did not permit such use. We cannot control how others use the information that you post to public areas of our Services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technology. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use cookies, web beacons, local stored objects (LSOs), JavaScript and similar technology in connection with your use of some of our Services, including our Sites and Mobile Apps, to collect Usage Data and other analytics data. We may also permit third-parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect usage and analytics data on our Sites and Mobile Apps. In addition, some of our Services may use analytic software (which may be provided by third-parties) to collect further Usage Data regarding the usage patterns of our users. We may combine Usage Data with the other information we collect (including Personally Identifiable Information), which could enable us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Cookies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them. The &ldquo;Help&rdquo; portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether. Some features of the Services may not function with cookies disabled.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><strong>Cookies are grouped into four categories:</strong></li>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strictly necessary cookies</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some cookies are strictly necessary for you to be able to experience the full functionality of our Sites. For example, these cookies allow you to use the website and log-in to your account as intended. We also use cookies to direct you to the right website based on geography and language and to detect and prevent security threats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance cookies</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Performance cookies tell us about how you use the site and they help us to make it better. For example, these cookies count the number of visitors to our website and see how visitors move around when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users find what they are looking for easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functional cookies</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Functional cookies allow the Sites to remember your preferences, helping you to customize your content on our Sites. This type of cookie enables us to highlight products and services we believe are of interest and relevance to you. This way we can remember you when you return to our site and to give you the best possible user experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting cookies</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Targeting cookies allow us to show more relevant advertising by serving you information, offers and promos that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and apps. These cookies may also be set through our sites by our advertising partners. For more information on third party cookies, please review the Third-Party Tracking Section.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Transfer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most of our Services are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside of the United States, where laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure differ from United States laws, please be advised that your continued use of our Services will be governed by United States law, this Policy, and any other terms applicable to our Services. User Information may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in which you reside (including the United States). If you are located in a country outside the United States and submit User Information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Policy and to the transfer of that User Information to, or storage of that information in, the United States or other locations in which information is stored. Some international users have certain legal rights to access certain Personally Identifiable Information we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment or deletion. Please be advised that because our personnel have a limited ability to identify and access an individual user&rsquo;s Personally Identifiable Information that our customer has submitted to the Services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, we may first refer your request to the customer who submitted your Personally Identifiable Information, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request. If you would like us to delete your Personally Identifiable Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. There may be a brief delay in processing that request, while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. We reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Services, as we may need such information to provide the Services to you. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</span></li>
