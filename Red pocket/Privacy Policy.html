This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how RedPocket, including its parents, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates, (&quot;Company&quot;),will collect, access, use or disclose your Personal Information. It applies to all of our products and services, including our customer portal (collectively, “Services”). It does not apply to third-party or affiliated services, which are governed by separate privacy policies. By using our Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. For more information about our Services, please review our Terms and Conditions which may be found <a href="https://www.redpocket.com/terms_and_conditions">here</a> and our Consumer Broadband Disclosure which may be found <a href="https://www.redpocket.com/openinternet">here</a>.</p><p>We may modify the terms of this policy from time to time, and will notify of any material changes in the manner required by law. Please check this page regularly for updates.</p><h2>What is Customer Proprietary Information?</h2><p>Customer Proprietary Information (Customer PI or Personal Information) includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), and the content of your communications.</p><p>PII is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Personal Information does not include information that is not used to identify you, such as aggregate or anonymous information. Federal and state law require Company to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information.</p><p>CPNI is information related to a subscriber’s use of Company’s network (e.g., broadband traffic statistics, device identifiers, call detail information) and information contained within Company subscribers’ voice-service bills. CPNI does not include directory information such as name, postal address, or telephone number. As Company provides our Services to you, Company obtains information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location and destination of telecommunications services we provide to you, as well as some other information found on your Company bills. This information may constitute CPNI, as defined by federal law. Any CPNI that Company collects from you will be handled in accordance with federal law, the Company’s internal CPNI Policy and this Privacy Policy. Under federal law, you have the right, and Company has the duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.</p><h2>How do we protect information?</h2><p>We implement a variety of reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. Your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p><p></p></div><div class="drop-down-info "><p>Information you provide to us</p><a id="information-we-collect"></a><img src="/_next/static/media/expand_more_light.ff69b20d.svg" class="icon" alt="Expand/Collapse Icon"/></div><div class="interior "><p>We collect the personal information you provide to us when you purchase our products or visit our website.

When you leave our network, you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties. Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your Personal Information and obtaining information from Company, including location information (when applicable). You may also choose to give your Personal Information directly to third parties when using our wireless services or devices. The Personal Information you give to a third party will be subject to that third party’s terms, conditions and policies—not this Privacy Policy. You should always review a third party’s privacy policy and terms of service before providing your Personal Information to them or using their services or products.</p><p><i>Pre Installed third party applications</i> Company has partnered with selected third-party application developers to enhance your RedPocket experience, and their applications may be found on your device that you use with our service. These applications may or may not be branded as Company applications and may be preinstalled on your device when you obtain it from Company or installed on your device via over-the-air download at no cost to you.

Please send us any and all feedback pertaining to privacy or any other issue. Thank you for choosing RedPocket.</p><h3>What if I visit or use a third-party website, application, or service?</h3><p>In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links in our Services. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p><h3>What policies apply to children under the age of 13?</h3><p>If we make available offers and products online where a child informs us that he or she is under the age of 13, we will ask a parent to confirm his/her consent in advance of further collection, use or disclosure of personal information from that child. You should be aware, however, that wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by minors without the knowledge of Company. If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the actual adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.</p><h3>What special rights apply to California consumers?</h3><p>The California “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, entitles California consumers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for that business’ direct marketing purposes. Company may share Personal Information between Company affiliates and marketing agents for marketing purposes. We do not share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their own independent marketing purposes without your consent. California residents may request the categories of Personal Information Company shared with its affiliates during the previous calendar year, if any. To make your request for information or to opt-out of the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, send contact us using the address above or below. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the &quot;Shine the Light&quot; requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="content-wrapper w-100 pb-lg"><div class="powered-by-footer"><hr class="my-md"/><span class="text-xs">Powered
