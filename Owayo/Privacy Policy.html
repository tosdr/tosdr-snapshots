<strong>III. General information concerning data processing</strong><br/>
<strong>1. Scope of the processing of personal data</strong>
<p>
As a rule, we only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The processing of the personal data of our users generally takes place only with their consent. An exception applies in cases where the prior obtaining of consent is not possible for actual reasons and the processing is permitted by statutory regulations.
</p>
<strong>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>
<p>
Should we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a) GDPR forms the legal basis for this.<br/>
When processing personal data which is necessary to fulfil a contract where the contracting party is the data subject, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b) GDPR forms the legal basis for this. This also applies to processing which is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Should processing of personal data be necessary to fulfil a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter c) GDFPR forms the legal basis for this. In case that vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person make the processing of personal data necessary, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter d) GDPR forms the legal basis for this.<br/>
<br/>
Should the processing be necessary in order to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and should the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the data subject not outweigh our legitimate interest, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f) forms the legal basis of the processing.
</p>
<strong>3. Data deletion and duration of the saving</strong>
<p>
The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked, once the purpose of the saving no longer applies. Saving can take place beyond this time, if this was provided for by the European or national legislator in EU directives, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a saving period prescribed by the named norms expires, unless it is necessary to continue saving the data in order to conclude or fulfil a contract.

</p>
<strong>XIII. Google Analytics</strong>
<p>
The body responsible for the processing has integrated the Google Analytics components (with anonymisation function) on this Internet site. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the gathering, collection and evaluation of data concerning the behaviour of visitors to Internet sites. Amongst others, a web analysis service records data concerning from what Internet site a data subject came across an Internet site (so-called referrer), which subpages of the Internet site have been accessed or how often and for what duration a subpage was visited. A web analysis service is primarily used to optimize an Internet site and for a cost-benefit analysis in relation to Internet advertising.<br/>
<br/>
The operating company of the Google Analytics components is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.<br/>
<br/>
The body responsible uses the "_gat._anonymizeIp“ extension for the web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this extension, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymised by Google, should the Internet sites be accessed from a Member State of the European Union or another Member State of the European Economic Area.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the Google Analytics components is to analyse the user traffic on our Internet site. Amongst others, Google uses the data which is acquired in order to evaluate the use of our Internet sites, to compile online reports for us which state the activities on our Internet sites and to provide other services connected to the use of our Internet site.<br/>
<br/>
Google Analytics sets a cookie on the IT system of the data subject. An explanation of what cookies are is provided above. By means of the setting of the cookie, Google is able to analyse the use of our Internet site. By means of each accessing of the individual pages of this Internet site which is operated by the body responsible for the processing and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the IT system of the data subject is automatically instructed by the respective Google Analytics components to transfer data to Google for the purpose of the online analysis. In the course of this technical process, Google is informed of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which enables Google amongst others to trace the origin of the visitors and clicks and to subsequently carry out commission billing.<br/>
<br/>
By means of the cookie, personal information, such as the time of access, the location from which an access originated and the frequency of the visits to our Internet site by the data subject is saved. Each time our Internet sites are visited, this personal data, including your IP address of the Internet connection used by the data subject, is transferred to Google in the USA. This personal data is saved by Google in the USA. Google may pass this personal data gathered through the technical procedure on to third parties in certain cases.<br/>
<br/>
The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our Internet site, as set out above at any time by setting the Internet browser used accordingly and thereby permanently objecting to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google setting a cookie on the IT system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie which has already been set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the data subject has the option to object to the recording of the data generated by Google Analytics which relates to the use of this Internet site and the processing of this data by Google and to prevent such actions. In order to do so, the data subject needs to download and install a browser add on via the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>. This browser add on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information concerning the visits to Internet sites may be transferred to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add on is considered by Google to represent an objection. Should the IT system of the data subject be subsequently deleted, formatted or re-installed, the data subject needs to install the browser add on again in order to de-activate Google Analytics. Should the browser add on be de-installed or de-activated by the data subject or another person under his or her control, it is possible to re-install or re-activate the browser add on.<br/>
<br/>

More information in this respect can be found at: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&status=Active</a><br/>
<br/>
owayo has no influence over the type and scope of the data processed by Twitter, the type of processing and the use or disclosure of this data to third parties. It also has no effective way of monitoring this.<br/>
<br/>
By means of the use of Twitter, your personal data will be recorded, transferred, saved, disclosed and used by Twitter, and will be transferred to the USA, Ireland and any other country in which Twitter is present and saved and used there, regardless of where your place of residence is located.<br/>
<br/>
Thereby Twitter processes your data which is provided voluntarily on the one hand, such as your name and user name, email address, telephone address or the contacts in your address book, should you upload or synchronise this.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Twitter also evaluates the content shared by you as to what topics interest you, saves and processes confidential messages which you send to other users and can determine your location on the basis of GPS date, information concerning cable free networks or via your IP address, in order to provide you with advertising or other content.<br/>
<br/>
For the evaluation, Twitter Inc may use tools such as Twitter or Google Analytics. owayo has no influence over the use of such tools by Twitter Inc and has also not been informed of their potential use. Should such types of tools be used by Twitter Inc for the account of owayo, owayo has neither engaged nor signed off such a service and has not supported this in any other way. In addition, the data gathered during the analysis will not be provided to it. Merely specified non-personal information concerning the tweet activities, such as the number of profile or link clicks by a specified tweet can be viewed by owayo via its account. In addition, owayo has no means of preventing or suspending the use of such tools in its Twitter account.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Twitter is also informed if, for example, you view content even if you have not set up an account. This so-called "log data" may include the IP address, the browser type, the operating system, information concerning the previous website accessed and the sites accessed by you, your location, your mobile phone provider, the end device used by you (including device and application ID), the search terms used by you and cookie information.<br/>

<br/>
As Twitter Inc is a non-european provider which only has a European presence in Ireland, this is not subject to German data protection regulations by its own account. For example, this affects your right to information or the blocking or deletion of data or the option of objecting for the use of data for advertising purposes.<br/>
