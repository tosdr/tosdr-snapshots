<h3>8. Posting Agents</h3>
<p>A &quot;Posting Agent&quot; is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary 
  that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. To 
  moderate demands on CodeCogs's resources, you may not use a Posting 
  Agent to post Content to the Service without express permission or 
  license from CodeCogs. Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not 
  permitted to post Content on behalf of others, to cause Content to 
  be so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting 
  Content on behalf of others, except with express permission or 
  license from CodeCogs.</p>

<h3>9. No Spam Policy</h3>
<p>You understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements to
  CodeCogs email addresses or through CodeCogs computer systems, which is
  expressly prohibited by these TOU, will use or cause to be used servers
  located in California. Any unauthorized use of CodeCogs computer systems
  is a violation of the TOU and certain federal and state laws, including
  without limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. &sect; 1030 et
  seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the
  California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject the
  sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</p>

<h3>11. Limitations of Service</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that CodeCogs may establish limits concerning use of the
  Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained
  by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or
  other Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and the
  frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that CodeCogs
  has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any
  Content maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that
  CodeCogs reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the
  Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that CodeCogs
  shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
  suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>

<h3>12. Access to the Service</h3>
<p>CodeCogs grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access 
  the Service for your own personal use. This license does not include:
  (a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, 
  aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service 
  nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and 
  extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by CodeCogs. 
  A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search 
  engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather 
  information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, 
  provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses 
  using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file. 
&quot;General purpose internet search engine&quot; does not include a website or 
  search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings 
  or in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale, 
  services, or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified 
  ad listing services.</p>
<p>CodeCogs permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink
  on your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use
  is for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in
  personal web blogs or personal online media). If the total number of such
  postings displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100)
  postings, your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOU,
  absent express permission granted by CodeCogs to do so. You may also
  create a hyperlink to the home page of CodeCogs sites so long as the
  link does not portray CodeCogs, its employees, or its affiliates in a
  false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.</p>
<p>CodeCogs offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users
  can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings
  through third party software news aggregators. CodeCogs permits you to
  display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website
  or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for
  personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked
  back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the
  post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS
  feed, proper attribution to 'CodeCogs' as the source, (d) your use or
  display does not suggest that CodeCogs promotes or endorses any third
  party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not
  redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden
  CodeCogs's systems. CodeCogs reserves all rights in the content of
  the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.</p>
<p>Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by
  CodeCogs immediately terminates said permission or license. In order to
  collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the
  the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other
  purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first
  obtain a license from CodeCogs.</p>
<h3>13. Termination of Service</h3>
<p>You agree that CodeCogs, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not
  the obligation) to delete or deactivate your account, block your email or IP
  address, or otherwise terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any
  part thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any
  Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation,
  if CodeCogs believes that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or
  spirit of the TOU. Further, you agree that CodeCogs shall not be liable
  to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
  Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination.
  Sections 2, 4, 6 and 12-18 shall survive termination of the TOU.</p>

<h3>14. Proprietary Rights</h3>
<p>The Service is protected to the maximum extent permitted by copyright laws
  and international treaties. Content displayed on or through the Service is
  protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to
  copyrights laws, and international conventions. Any reproduction,
  modification, creation of derivative works from or redistribution of the
  site or the collective work, and/or copying or reproducing the sites
  or any portion thereof to any other server or location for further
  reproduction or redistribution is prohibited without the express
  written consent of CodeCogs. You further agree not to reproduce, 
  duplicate or copy Content from the Service without the express written 
  consent of CodeCogs, and agree to abide by any and all copyright notices 
  displayed on the Service. You may not decompile or disassemble, reverse 
  engineer or otherwise attempt to discover any source code contained in the 
  Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to reproduce, 
  duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any 
  aspect of the Service. CodeCogs is a registered mark in the U.K. Patent 
  and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Although CodeCogs does not claim ownership of content that its users post,
  by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically
  grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to
  CodeCogs an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide
  license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to
  prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Content,
  and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the

<h3>17. Indemnity</h3>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold CodeCogs, its officers, subsidiaries,
  affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, service
  providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand,
  including reasonable attorney fees and court costs, made by any third party
  due to or arising out of Content you submit, post or make available through
  the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the TOU, your
  breach of any of the representations and warranties herein, or your
  violation of any rights of another.</p>

<h3>18. General Information</h3>
<p>The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and CodeCogs and
  govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you
  and CodeCogs. The TOU and the relationship between you and CodeCogs
  shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
  its conflict of law provisions. You and CodeCogs agree to submit to the
  personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county
  of San Francisco, California. The failure of CodeCogs to exercise or
  enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of
  such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court
  of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
  the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
  reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in
  full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to
  the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use
  of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such
  claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>

<h3>19. Violation of Terms and Liquidated Damages</h3>
<p>Please report any violations of the TOU, by flagging the modules(s) for
  review, or by contact us at: <a href="/pages/email/sendmail.php?cc=2" target="_blank"><strong>CodeCogs Abuse </strong></a></p>
<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our 
  right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, 
  if it becomes necessary for CodeCogs to pursue legal action to enforce the 
  TOU, you will be liable to pay CodeCogs the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of CodeCogs' damages for 
  the specified breaches of the TOU:</p>
<p>a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2)
  falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
  entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about
  another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay
  CodeCogs five hundred pounds (&pound;500) for each such message.
  This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive
  parodies of public figures.</p>
<p>b. If CodeCogs establishes limits on the frequency with which you may
  access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you
  agree to pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (&pound;100) for each message posted
  in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access CodeCogs in
  excess of such limits, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to CodeCogs email
  addresses or through CodeCogs computer systems, you agree to pay
  CodeCogs twenty five pounds (&pound;25) for each such email.</p>
<p>d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described 
  above, you agree to pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (&pound;100) for each 
  item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, CodeCogs may elect 
  to issue a warning before assessing damages.</p>
<p>e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the
  TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to
  pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (&pound;100) for each and every Item of Conent
  posted in violation of the TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent
  of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the
&quot;Principal&quot;), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in
  violation of the TOU) agrees to pay CodeCogs an additional one hundred
  pounds (&pound;100) for each Item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on
  behalf of the principal in violation of the TOU.</p>
<p>f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise
  exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in
  violation of the TOU without CodeCogs's express written permission,
  you agree to pay CodeCogs two thousand pounds (&pound;2,000) for each day
  on which you engage in such conduct.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you agree to pay CodeCogs's actual damages, to the extent such
  actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Not withstanding any other
  provision of the TOU, CodeCogs retains the right to seek the remedy
  of specific performance of any term contained in the TOU, or a preliminary
  or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the
  exercise of any power granted in the TOU, or any combination thereof.</p>
