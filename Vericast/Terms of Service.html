Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitratorinstead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limitedreview by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement toarbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Use, and/or youraccess to, or use of, the Sites or Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, orany other legal theory, and regardless of when the claim arises.

The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim ordispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ). You and Valassis Digital agree to use good faithefforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Valassis Digital do not reach an agreement to do so within 30days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.

Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Michigan, but if the claim is for$10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely onthe basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) byan in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned writtendecision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, arebased. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expensesat any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of thearbitratorâs ruling on the merits.</p><p>YOU AND VALASSIS DIGITAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUALCAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p><p>Further, unless both you and Valassis Digital agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than onepersonâs claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
