<p>This Fan Content Policy (the “Policy”) sets out guidelines for individual fans to create personal, non-commercial, fan art (such as artwork, photographs, videos, and other creative materials) that is based on PikPok Assets; and PikPok Asset-related websites, including the Sites, and apps that are freely accessible to the public (collectively, “Fan Content”).</p>



<p>Please read this Policy carefully before creating any Fan Content and check back frequently for updates as we reserve the right to modify the Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy to the PikPok website, or to eliminate this Policy in its entirety.  Your use of the PikPok Assets is at your own risk, and we do not offer any warranties.  Failure to comply with any of the terms contained in this Policy may result in our utilizing legal remedies to enforce our rights, including issuing takedown notices to service providers.</p>

This includes charging others a fee of any kind to view, access, download, or consume your Fan Content, or to help sell other products or services.  As an exception, you are permitted to monetize web videos via advertising through platform-operated programs on YouTube, Twitch, and other similar online services, provided that your Fan Content otherwise meets the requirements of this Policy and the rules of the platform you use to share your Fan Content.</p>



<p>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not use PikPok Assets in any manner that is derogatory to PikPok or that may damage the value, reputation, or goodwill of PikPok or its products or brands (solely as determined by PikPok).</p>



<p>1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not say nor imply that your Fan Content is endorsed or approved by PikPok.</p>



<p>1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must make expressly clear that your Fan Content is unofficial, fan-made, and in no way affiliated with PikPok by including the following disclaimer or a similar notice on or in connection with your Fan Content, “PikPok is not affiliated with this content nor has it endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved it.  For more information, see PikPok’s Fan Content Policy: pikpok.com/terms-of-use.”  This disclaimer must be in a font legible to end users.

<p>1.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not use our trademarks (e.g., Game titles and the name “PikPok”) other than to describe the fact that your Fan Content is about one of our Games.  Use of the PikPok logos is strictly prohibited.</p>



<p>1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not use any Fan Content to create or use social media or other accounts that could be mistaken for official PikPok accounts; or register or use domain names, logos, or marks that are similar to the PikPok domain names, logos, or marks.</p>

<li>If the Dispute is not resolved by the foregoing negotiations within thirty (30) days, then the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration as follows: (i) if you are a resident of the United States, Canada or Mexico, in Los Angeles, California, under the auspices of JAMS and in accordance with the rules of JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these Terms of Use, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules; or (ii) if you are a resident of a Member State of the European Union, in London, England, under the auspices of JAMS International, in accordance with the rules of JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these  Terms of Use, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules; or (iii) if you are a resident elsewhere, in Wellington, New Zealand, under the auspices of New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre, and in each instance, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the rules of JAMS.</li>



<li>The arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS or by New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre, as applicable, in accordance with its rules. The arbitrator shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or attorney with at least ten (10) years practice advising clients in the internet or e-commerce industry. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except for the initial filing fee if you file a Dispute, we will pay all other filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Dispute Notice is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in U.S. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or corollary statute under the laws of the European Union and New Zealand, as applicable), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS or New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre Rules, as applicable. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable Rules. In any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator(s) may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits.</li>



<li>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND PIKPOK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</li>
