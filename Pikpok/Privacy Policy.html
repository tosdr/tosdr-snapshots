We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your personal information will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.  Our third parties have executed or provided to us adequate safeguards in the form of our standard Data Protection Addendum to our agreements with those third parties, which we can provide to you upon your request by contacting <a href="mailto:privacysupport@pikpok.com">privacysupport@pikpok.com</a>.</p>
<p>Where you have the option to withdraw consent to opt out of any collection where your data is transferred across borders, you may do so.  The transfer of such data is typically for the purpose of providing our Services to you, as specified above. Consequently, any request to delete or modify such personal information may result in the termination or interruption of our Services with respect to your usage of such Services.</p>

<h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
</div>
<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our Services. Some of the features on our Sites and Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features.</p>
<p>When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifying parents or guardians about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from a parent or guardian for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and Services directly to their children; and</li>
<li>Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Additional Information for Residents of California and Certain Other U.S. States</h2>
</div>
<p>Under the laws of California and certain other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, the residents of those U.S. states who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for their direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@pikpok.com">privacyofficer@pikpok.com</a>.</p>
<p>The California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business &#038; Professions Code §§22575-22579) requires operators of websites to disclose how they respond to “do not track” (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites or online services. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.  While some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning our collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this Policy.  For information about Do Not Track, please visit: <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.org/">www.allaboutdnt.org</a></p>
