We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain technical and personal information, and may allow advertisers to collect technical and personal information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). Please see the your rights and choices in relation to your personal information section below for more information about opting out of behavioral advertising.</p><p style="text-align: start">Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We share your personal information only as described in this Policy. Plarium does permit third parties to collect personal information through our Service and shares personal information with third parties for business purposes. These business purposes are described above and include providing advertising on our Service and elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called “interest-based advertising”). While we provide you the choices described above in the “Cookies” and “Third Party Services” sections, we do not treat these relationships as “sales” of personal information where that concept is relevant under applicable law. The information practices of these third parties are also not covered by this Policy. However, should these third parties be perceived as such, we provide options for you to opt out. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your device and other personal information with these third parties by following the instructions in the "Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information" section below</p><p style="text-align: start">Please note that if you use multiple devices to access our mobile or online applications you will need to renew this choice and will need to opt out separately on each device.</p><h2 style="text-align: start"><strong>International Transfers</strong></h2><p style="text-align: start">We may transfer your personal information outside your country of residence, including possibly to countries that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to your country of residence. We implement appropriate safeguards to protect the personal information that we transfer in accordance with applicable data protection requirements. Where required by law, we put in place standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information. You can ask for a copy of such standard contractual clauses by sending an email request to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cfcfee5faedeff5a2fff9fcfce3fef8ccfce0edfee5f9e1a2efe3e1" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="94e4e6fde2f5f7edbae7e1e4e4fbe6e0d4e4f8f5e6fde1f9baf7fbf9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p><p style="text-align: start">Specifically, for our users resident in the EU or UK, please note that Plarium is located in Israel, a country that is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission or UK government, respectively. &nbsp;Where Plarium onward transfers your personal information to a company located outside of Israel, the EU or the UK, we will take steps to ensure that your information is given a similar level of protection as that given in Israel, the EU or the UK. You have the right to request from us information about, including a copy of, the contractual safeguards Plarium puts in place to achieve this.</p><h2 style="text-align: start"><strong>Data retention</strong></h2><p style="text-align: start">We will keep your information for as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above in accordance with applicable law, generally no longer than 3 years from the date you stopped using our services. To determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process the personal information and whether we can achieve such purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p><h2 style="text-align: start"><strong>Protecting personal information</strong></h2><p style="text-align: start">We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control.

However, please note that no system or network is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use, disclose, or alter your personal information for improper purposes.</p><p style="text-align: start">To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable measures (such as requiring a unique password) to verify your identity before permitting you access to your account or the Service.</p><h2 style="text-align: start"><strong>Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information</strong></h2><p style="text-align: start"><em>Accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal information</em></p><p style="text-align: start">Plarium takes your privacy seriously and works in a transparent way. In that sense, upon providing sufficient identification (to protect others' privacy), you may have rights under applicable law to request information from us about the personal information we hold in relation to you and correct any inaccurate data we hold.</p><p style="text-align: start">Furthermore, depending on where you live, you may also have rights to change or request that we delete any personal information about you, such as by changing the applicable information found in your Plarium account. However, if you decide to delete or anonymize your personal information, you may no longer have access to certain content (e.g. information of your game progress) and your account may become deactivated.</p><p style="text-align: start">In certain territories (including the EU, UK and Brazil), you also have a legal right to ask for a restriction of processing or to object to processing.</p><p style="text-align: start">You may also have the right to withdraw your consent, on the basis of which we process your personal information, at any time, by closing your account or otherwise clearly indicating your withdrawal of consent.

For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Consumer Choice Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/participating" target="_blank">DAA companies</a>. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> or the NAI’s website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p><p style="text-align: start">Users in the European Union or United Kingdom may go the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> website and select their country to learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt out in their own country. For example, users in France may go to the <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies/" target="_blank">Contrôler ses cookies</a> website to opt out of certain third-party ad networks’ interest-based advertising and find additional information at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com/fr</a>.</p><p style="text-align: start">Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Consumer Choice Page</a>, the NAI <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a>, or through the various EDAA websites will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or App or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, and/or EDAA websites, your opt out may not be effective.
