                    <h3>USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP
                        OF CONTENT</h3>
                    <p>Sites must not
                        contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or
                        redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party websites /
                        resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the
                        rights to publish material, not for IFastNet to prove that you do
                        not. IFastNet does not allow the propagation or distribution of
                        copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.</p>
                    <h3>ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</h3>
                    <p>Sites must not use
                        excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth,
                        processor utilization and / or disk space. Please see the 'High
                        Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.</p>
                    <h3>SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</h3>
                    <p>Scripts on the site
                        must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the
                        server as an application server. Using the server to generate large
                        volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is
                        not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on
                        servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the
                        reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they
                        are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and
                        are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy
                        services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>

                    <p>The primary purpose
                        of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a
                        single email based upon user entered information, or update a
                        database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform
                        processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing
                        mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a IFastNet
                        -hosted domain.</p>
                    <p>Sites must not
                        contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources,
                        or other sites on the same server</p>
                    <h3>USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS</h3>
                    <p>IFastNet offers
                        large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean
                        space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to
                        view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and
                        linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads,
                        or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected
                        archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content
                        such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the
                        user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.</p>

                    <p>On unlimited disk
                        space plans we offer quotaless disk space access, however the disks
                        in servers are not unlimited so you may become limited if a hard
                        drive begins to fill to capacity.</p>
                    <p>INODE USAGE</p>

                    <p>In computing, an
                        inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system
                        such as UFS. An inode stores basic information about a regular file,
                        directory, or other file system object.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode</a></p>

                    <p>IFastNet reserves
                        the right to limit INODEs usage on premium hosting plans to 380000 on starter premium plan, 840000 on super and ultimate premium plans, and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans subject to acceptable
                        usage.</p>
                    <h3>RIGHT TO SUSPEND / TERMINATE HOSTING SERVICES</h3>
                    <p>You acknowledge that
                        IFastNet may or may not pre-screen Content, but that IFastNet and its

                        discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is
                        available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, IFastNet
                        and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that
                        violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable, or caused network / server overload. You agree that you
                        must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any
                        Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or
                        usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you
                        may not rely on any Content created by IFastNet or submitted to

                    <h2>7. INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON
                        IFASTNET NETWORK</h2>
                    <p>When you register
                        with IFastNet , you acknowledge that in using IFastNet services to
                        send electronic communications (including but not limited to email,
                        uploading photos and files and other Internet activities), you will
                        be causing communications to be sent through IFastNet 's computer
                        networks, portions of which are located in California, Ohio, UK, and
                        other locations in the United States and portions of which are
                        located abroad. As a result, and also as a result of IFastNet 's
                        network architecture and business practices and the nature of
                        electronic communications, even communications that seem to be

                        communications regardless of where you are physically located at the

                        interstate data transmissions.</p>

                    <h2>19 FREE DOMAIN WITH PAID HOSTING</h2>

                    <p>Free domain names
                        which are included with Paid Hosting accounts are the property of
                        ifastnet Internet. IFastNet will always retain ownership of free
                        domain names we register. If requested, IFastNet will allow the
                        'transfer' any free domains to an alternative hosting provider if a
                        transfer administration fee is paid, which amounts to $29.99. If the
                        service has been provisioned for over 12 months or sooner IFastNet
                        may waiver the above mentioned transfer fee. IFastNet reserves the
                        right to cancel / transfer domain names which are provided with paid
                        hosting accounts. We reserve the right to renew or allow the
                        expiration of domain names we register.</p>

                    <p>If a service is
                        cancelled and a refund requested the cost incurred of renewing or
                        providing the free domain name will be minused from the refund
                        amounts (this could sometimes lead to a negative value). The .INFO
                        domain name provided with the 'monthly standard' premium plan is free
                        for the 1st year only, to keep the domain after the 1st year, a
                        renewal fee needs to be paid. (This is a separate additional payment
                        to the monthly payments for the hosting) To renew the INFO domain
                        name, we require a payment of $23.38 USD to cover the cost of
                        renewing the domain with the registrars.</p>
                    <p>The free domain
                        included with the monthly ultimate account is free to renewal each
                        year providing you are in good billing status for all 12 monthly
                        payments over the year.</p>

                    <p>You are not allowed
                        to alter the name servers or transfer a free domain included with the
                        monthly ultimate plan until 2 (two) complete months of payment has
                        been made (2 x $7.99). We reserve the right to suspend any free
                        domain name associated with a monthly ultimate account which has not
                        been paid for 2 complete months.</p>
