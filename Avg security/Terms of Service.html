               	<p>This Section 2A sets out some important provisions relating to the way your auto-renewing subscription functions. Further important provisions (such as your ‘right of withdrawal’) are set out in the terms made available by the entity from which you purchased the Solution (“<i>Distributor</i>”) and accepted by you as governing your subscription.</p>
              <p>2A.1 Your subscription will automatically renew, and you will be notified in advance of the renewal. Please note that the renewal price may be different to the price you paid for the existing Subscription Period, and the notification in advance of the renewal will include how much the subsequent Subscription Period will cost, when you will be charged and how long the subsequent Subscription Period will last.</p>
              <p>2A.2 Unless otherwise cancelled, the Distributor will attempt to take payment from you (using your saved credit card or bank account details), for the subsequent Subscription Period, up to thirty five (35) days in advance of the renewal date.</p>
              <p>2A.3 To the extent payment is unable to be taken on the first attempt, the Distributor will make further attempts to take payment up to 15 days after the renewal date and you may be contacted to update your payment details.</p>
              <p>2A.4 Upon automatic renewal of your subscription, you will receive a confirmation email which shall include all the key information in respect of your automatic renewal and the duration of the subsequent Subscription Period.</p>
              <p>2A.5 You are entitled to switch-off the auto-renewal of your subscription using the process notified to you during the order process for the subscription, meaning that your subscription will come to an end when the then current Subscription Period expires. Once you have elected to cancel the auto-renewal of your subscription, auto-renewal will remain cancelled unless you subsequently agree to a new subscription.</p>
              <p>2A.6 If your subscription auto-renews, you may cancel that renewal no later than 30 days following such renewal date. If the Distributor has taken payment for the next Subscription Period (“<i>Renewal Payment</i>”) then you will receive a full refund of the Renewal Payment.</p>

<p>Vendor, from time to time during the Subscription Period and without your separate permission or consent, may from time to time deploy an upgrade or update of, or replacement for, any Solution (“<i>Update</i>”), and as a result of any such deployment you may not be able to use the applicable Solution or Device (or certain functions of the Device) until any such Update is fully installed or activated. Each Update will be deemed to form a part of the “Solution” for all purposes under this Agreement. Updates may include both additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion. Vendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay Updates but, in any event, you may need to download and permit installation or activation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. Vendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed or activated all Updates. Vendor in its sole discretion will determine when and if Updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any Updates available to you. Vendor in its sole discretion may stop providing Updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or Updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.</p>

				<p id="arbitration-agreement-1">11.1. This Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> applies to any Dispute arising from or related to any Solution, subscription for any Solution or this Agreement, and involving you and Vendor. “Dispute”, for the purposes of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a>, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis, claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation or fraud, indemnification, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), and violation of statute or regulation).</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-2">11.2. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide Vendor with a notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of your name, address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested by you. You must send any notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal.department@gendigital.com (stating Subject: Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> Notice of Dispute Under EULA).</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-3">
11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-4"> 11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“<i>FAA</i>”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles). Except as provided in Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement-5" class="link-primary">11.5</a> below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-5">
11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> is subject to the following exceptions:</p>

<p>11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</p>

<p>11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.</p>

<p>11.5.3. If you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the “<i>ODR Platform</i>”). The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" class="link-primary">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-6">11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “<i>AAA</i>”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “<i>Consumer Procedures</i>”) and will be subject to the following:</p>

<p>11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>

<p>11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.</p>

<p>11.6.3. You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.</p>

<p>11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-7">11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a>, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<i>Commercial Procedures</i>”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.</p>

<p>(a) The Associate may need to run various scripts on your equipment, make changes to its configuration, install and uninstall software, and make other changes to the equipment and/or software settings of such equipment as may be necessary to address your issues. You understand that the Associate may, but is not obligated to, install and remove various proprietary or third party software tools where the Associate deems it necessary to assist you with the issues that you are experiencing. Elements of such software are protected by law, including copyright.</p>

<p>(b) You acknowledge and agree that, by authorizing the Associate to establish a remote connection session, you grant Vendor (and partners and contractors acting on Vendor’s behalf) full or limited access to your equipment, software and network (depending on your equipment, software and network configuration), and authorize Vendor to make such modifications as described above or as otherwise advised by the Associate during delivery of the Solution. You acknowledge and agree that the Associate, or you acting on the Associate’s direction may alter, delete or corrupt software or data on your equipment, change equipment, software or network settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your equipment, software or network.</p>

<p>(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Associate may have access to any information stored on your Device. Associates are trained not to access more information than necessary to resolve the issues for which you are requesting the Associate’s support. You must nevertheless remain in front of your Device screen to observe the actions of the Associate while he or she delivers the Solution on your Device. You will have the opportunity to end the live support session at any time by advising the Associate or disconnecting the remote connection session.</p>

<p>13.10.2. <i>Assistance Software</i>.</p>

<p>(a) Vendor or an Associate, as a condition to providing services under the Assurance Plan, Premium Technical Support or other services, may instruct you to download and install on the Device a software program (the “<i>Assistance Software</i>”) allowing the Associate to gain remote access to your Device, gather information about the Device and its operations, diagnose and repair the problem, and change Device settings. You may also need to follow other instructions given by the Vendor or an Associate.</p>

<p>(b) If you or an Associate installs Assistance Software on a Device, that Assistance Software:</p>

<p>(i) May require that you activate it on your Device. If you do not complete the activation process within the period of time requested by the Associate or as prompted by the Assistance Software, the Assistance Software may cease to function until the activation is complete.</p>

<p>(ii) May communicate with Vendor’s (or its partner’s or contractor’s) servers on a regular basis to: (i) ensure that you receive all the services and software you are eligible to as part of your Solution; (ii) enable you to promptly launch a chat session with an Associate as part of your Solution; or (iii) give you access to certain self-service tools as part of your Solution.</p>

<p>(iii) May by default constantly run on your Device and perform various background tasks that help maintain your Device in working condition. When running, it may collect various data regarding your Device, including its technical specifications, information regarding its operating system, downloaded and/or installed software, updates and upgrades, the availability and the status of your security software, backups and firewalls, various unique identifiers, system and software error messages, network connections status, connected peripherals and other connected devices, and similar such information and data. This information helps Vendor to prevent many common issues that you may be experiencing, and also to quickly identify problems for which you may be requesting Vendor’s support.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-11">13.11. Avast Driver Updater</p>

<p>13.11.1. Avast Driver Updater is intended for use on a Device that is a single physical computer, and not a “virtual machine” in which a shared computing resource emulates the functions of several dedicated physical computers. Avast Driver Updater will not be as effective when used on a virtual machine rather than a physical computer.</p>

<p>13.11.2. Avast Driver Updater relies on manufacturer-provided data in device driver installation files, including release dates, to provide information displayed by the Solution in scan results. MEMBERS OF THE VENDOR GROUP AND VENDOR PARTNERS DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT ANY DEVICE DRIVER PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION WILL BE THE LATEST, OR ANY PARTICULAR VERSION, OF SUCH DEVICE DRIVER NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DIFFERENT OR CONTRARY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SOLUTION.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-12">13.12. Avast Secure Web Gateway and Avast Secure Internet Gateway</p>

<p>13.12.1. As used in this Section <a href="#special-terms-12" class="link-primary">13.12</a>:</p>

<p>(a) “<i>Aggregated Data</i>” means data: (i) anonymized, and not identifiable to any individual person or entity; (ii) combined with the data of other users of an Avast Secure Gateway, and/or additional data sources; and (iii) presented in a manner by which individual users of an Avast Secure Gateway may not be identified.</p>

<p>(b) “<i>Avast Secure Gateway</i>” means the Avast Secure Web Gateway or Avast Secure Internet Gateway;</p>

<p>(c) “<i>DNS Transaction</i>” means a recursive DNS query you send through your use of Avast Secure Web Gateway.</p>

<p>(d) “<i>Seat</i>” means a subscription for an individual that accesses the Internet in connection with an Avast Secure Gateway, as further described by Section <a href="#special-terms-12.5" class="link-primary">13.12.5</a>. A Seat may only be transferred from one such individual to another such individual if the original individual is no longer permitted to access, and does not access, the Internet in connection with the Avast Secure Gateway.</p>

<p>(e) “<i>Transaction</i>” means an HTTP or HTTPS request sent to, or by, you through your use of the Avast Secure Internet Gateway.</p>

<p>13.12.2. You must not, from any Device protected by an Avast Secure Gateway: (i) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of any applicable laws; (ii) send infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or illegal material; (iii) access blocked services in violation of any applicable laws; or (iv) run automated queries to Internet URLs.</p>

<p>13.12.3. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) in order for Vendor to provide the Avast Secure Gateway, you must forward your Internet traffic to Vendor via valid forwarding mechanisms that allow for automatic fail-over (i.e. DNS, PAC, IPSEC, GRE tunnels or an appropriate Vendor Solution); (ii) you are responsible for supplying Vendor with any technical data and other information Vendor may reasonably request from time to time; (iii) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use the Malicious Code (as defined in Section <a href="#special-terms-16.1" class="link-primary">13.16.1</a> (b)), spam, botnets, or other information derived from your use of an Avast Secure Gateway for the purposes of: (1) maintaining, improving and/or analyzing the Avast Secure Gateways; (2) complying with any legal or contractual requirements; or (3) making malicious or unwanted content anonymously available to Vendor Partners for the purpose of further developing and enhancing the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iv) Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may develop and commercialize benchmarks and measures based on Aggregated Data.</p>

<p>13.12.4. Vendor Group and Vendor Partners reserve the right to manage bandwidth or route traffic across the Internet in a commercially optimal way, provided such actions do not compromise Vendor’s obligations with respect to the Avast Secure Gateways. Vendor or a Vendor Partner (as applicable) may suspend your access to, or download of, the Avast Secure Gateways in the event your use of these Solutions represents an imminent threat to any network of Vendor Group or a Vendor Partner, or if required to comply with applicable laws. In such circumstances, Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable) will: (i) suspend the Avast Secure Gateways only to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent any harm to any network of Vendor Group or Vendor Partners (for example, blocking offending source IP addresses) and to comply with applicable laws; (ii) use its reasonable efforts to contact you promptly and give you the opportunity to promptly change the configuration of you server(s) accordingly and/or work with you to promptly resolve the issues causing the suspension of the Avast Secure Gateways; and (iii) reinstate any such suspended Avast Secure Gateways after all such issues are resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable).</p>

<p id="special-terms-12.5">13.12.5. For the purposes of determining whether you have purchased sufficient Seats, every 2,000 Transactions per calendar day flowing through the Avast Secure Internet Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Internet Gateway “Seat”, and every 2,000 DNS Transactions per calendar day flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway shall be considered an Avast Secure Web Gateway “Seat”.  You acknowledge and agree that the number of Seats you are required to purchase for your use of: (i) Avast Secure Internet Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Internet Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000; and (ii) Avast Secure Web Gateway will be calculated by dividing the total number of DNS Transactions flowing through Avast Secure Web Gateway per calendar day, by 2,000.</p>

<p>13.12.6. Although Vendor may not charge you separately for bandwidth in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway, Vendor and the relevant Vendor Partner incur significant bandwidth costs in providing of the Avast Secure Gateway to you. Accordingly, a material increase in your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway will significantly affect and disrupt the business operations of Vendor and the Vendor Partner. You acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances where your bandwidth consumption in connection with your use of the Avast Secure Gateway materially exceeds the number of DNS Transactions, or DNS Transactions per Seat, specified by the Applicable Conditions, Vendor or the Vendor Partner may notify you, in which case you must negotiate in good faith with Vendor: (i) on a bandwidth reduction plan; and/or (ii) to increase the pricing for of the Avast Secure Gateway for the remainder of the Subscription Term. If you are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with Vendor within thirty (30) days from the date of notification by Vendor or Vendor Partner (as applicable), then Vendor may on thirty (30) days’ notice, terminate the remaining portion of your Subscription Term for the Avast Secure Gateway and refund to you any portion of the subscription fees you have pre-paid for the unused portion of the Subscription Term.</p>

<p>13.12.7. You acknowledge and agree that Vendor Group and Vendor Partners may use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from your transaction logs (i.e. the metadata of all network traffic sent to, or received from, you through your use of an Avast Secure Gateway) (the “<i>Transaction Logs</i>”). Transaction Logs will be retained by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners for rolling 6 month periods during the Subscription Period. On termination or expiration of the Subscription Period, the Transaction Logs shall be deleted by Vendor Group and Vendor Partners pursuant to the standard retention cycle of Vendor Group and Vendor Partners, or earlier as you may request in writing.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-13">13.13. Certain HMA Solutions</p>

<p>13.13.1. Virtual Private Network. Unless otherwise provided by the Applicable Conditions, your subscription to the HMA Virtual Private Network product (the “<i>HMA VPN</i>”) authorizes you to create no more than 5 simultaneous connections in respect of each HMA VPN subscription. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if you exceed the number of simultaneous connections authorized for your HMA VPN subscription, Vendor may at any time without any prior notice to you, suspend or disable your access to, and/or use of, the HMA VPN. If you wish to increase the authorized number of simultaneous connections for your HMA VPN subscription, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@hidemyass.com" class="link-primary">sales@hidemyass.com</a>.</p>

<p>13.13.2. Web Proxy. The HMA web proxy service (“<i>Web Proxy</i>”) is a free Solution that does not require you to register your details with Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for, and Vendor Group and Vendor Partners accept no liability to you or any third party for: (a) your access, viewing or use of, or the contents of (including any offensive or objectionable content), any third party website accessed or viewed while using Web Proxy; (b) your compliance with the terms of use applicable to any third party website you access, visit or use while using the Web Proxy; and (c) any claim, loss or damage arising from any content that you create, make available, transmit or display while using Web Proxy, including any claim, loss or damage suffered or incurred by Vendor Group or Vendor Partners.</p>
				<p id="special-terms-14">13.14. Virtual Private Networks. Several countries prohibit or restrict the use of virtual private networks (“<i>VPNs</i>”), and some have instituted technological measures to prevent VPNs from working. As a result, Vendor’s VPN Solutions (including the HMA VPN) are subject to territorial restrictions that may change from time to time.

<p>13.15.1. The limited warranty period established by Section <a href="#limited-warranty-1" class="link-primary">6.1</a> is extended for the Appliance to 1 year from the date of purchase (the “<i>Appliance Warranty Period</i>”).</p>

<p>13.15.2. You must notify Vendor promptly if the Appliance is or becomes defective. If you notify Vendor of the defect during the Appliance Warranty Period and Vendor is unable to remedy the defect remotely, Vendor at its option and expense within 5business days will either: (a) replace the Appliance with a new or refurbished unit of the Appliance, in which case the warranty established by Section <a href="#limited-warranty-1" class="link-primary">6.1</a> will apply for the remainder of the Appliance Warranty Period applicable to the original unit of the Appliance; or (b) terminate your subscription and refund any unearned subscription fees you have previously paid. If the Appliance fails following the end of the Appliance Warranty Period, or if it fails because of misuse, tampering, interference, abuse, casualty, loss or theft, Vendor may charge you its standard price for the replacement unit of the Appliance. Vendor in its sole discretion may replace the Appliance with a new or different appliance that will also be subject to this Agreement (including Section <a href="#special-terms-15" class="link-primary">13.15</a>).</p>
