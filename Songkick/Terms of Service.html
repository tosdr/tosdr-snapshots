This Agreement is between you and us.</p>

        <p>PLEASE NOTE:  The Site may include or be used in connection with certain Third Party Applications (as defined in Section 16 below).  Your access to or use of such Third Party Applications may be governed by additional terms and conditions that are not set forth in this Agreement and that are made available by the particular providers of such Third Party Applications.</p>
