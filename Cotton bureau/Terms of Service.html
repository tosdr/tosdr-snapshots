                <h2>Understanding Our Services and Websites</h2>
                <p>We host designs created by many designers.</p>
                <p>Designers don’t work for us and we don’t work for them: they are independent and we are not responsible for each other.</p>
                <p>We provide a platform that lets designers and customers reach each other, and we provide ways to make that happen easily.</p>
                <p>We do not endorse any expressions of others on our websites and services or in products available through our websites and services.</p>
                <p>We can’t control the interactions between designers and customers.</p>
                <p>We can’t monitor all the material on our site.</p>
                <p>We cannot control, and are not responsible for, websites of others (even if we link to them or they link to us).
                    We reserve the rights to change anything at any time, to refuse service or products, and to refuse designers or customers at our discretion. This helps us create the environment we
                    want.</p>
                <p>We care about our users, their experience, and the community we build around this platform. We want to make sure you’re satisfied with your order. If you would like to contact us for
                    customer service and support, please email <a href="mailto:support@cottonbureau.com">support@cottonbureau.com</a>.</p>

                <p>Designers and customers must not do anything that degrades the quality of our platform, community, or service.</p>
                <p><strong>Don’t do anything illegal, dangerous, harmful, offensive, or unwelcome.</strong></p>
                <p>We endorse free speech and give it wide latitude. But we also want to create an atmosphere and community that we consider both stimulating and respectful, and we reserve the right to
                    exclude any user or product.</p>
                <p>We can make any decision we want to make about what is offensive or unwelcome in our environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Our policy is to terminate</strong>, in appropriate circumstances, subscribers or account holders who are repeat copyright infringers. We may require proof that a competent
                    authority has rendered judgments of copyright infringement because we cannot know all the facts and circumstances to be certain about accusations of infringement. We reserve the right
                    to determine what circumstances are appropriate; it is difficult to identify them in the abstract.</p>
                <p><strong>We expect to cooperate</strong> with all valid subpoenas and court orders requiring disclosure of information to assist in government investigations, law enforcement, or
                    litigation.</p>
                <p>If you cause us any losses or harms, <strong>we reserve the right</strong> to bring a lawsuit to remedy those losses or harms.</p>
                <p>If you have a problem with what you believe is copyright infringement of your own copyrighted work on our service, please send us an appropriate notification of claimed infringement
                    that complies with 17 U.S.C. §  512 to our Copyright Agent, Nathan Peretic, at <a href="mailto:copyright@cottonbureau.com">copyright@cottonbureau.com</a> or at the following postal
                    address: 110 Torrens St. Suite 101, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.</p>
                <p>If you have a problem with what you believe is a trademark infringement of your own trademark on our service, please contact us as follows: <a href="mailto:trademark@cottonbureau.com">trademark@cottonbureau.com</a>.</p>

                    EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT OR
                    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. COTTON BUREAU DOES NOT WARRANT THE OPERATION OF ITS OFFERINGS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF COTTON BUREAU SERVICES
                    SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY A COTTON BUREAU AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.</p>
                <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT COTTON BUREAU WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCLUDING BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, GOODWILL, USE OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE COTTON BUREAU’S

                <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT THE SPEAKER OR PUBLISHER OF ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL THAT OTHERS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WEBSITES OR SERVICES, AND THAT ALL MATERIAL ON
                    OUR WEBSITES OR SERVICES IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. WE DO NOT REGULARLY MONITOR USER CONTRIBUTIONS ON OUR WEBSITES OR SERVICES. YOU FURTHER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE
                    OR MAY NOT MAINTAIN OR REMOVE ANY PARTICULAR INFORMATION OR MATERIAL FROM OTHERS ON OUR WEBSITES AND SERVICES.</p>
                <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE MAKE NO GUARANTEE OR AFFIRMATION REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, QUALITY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS, OR OTHER QUALITIES OF INFORMATION OR
                    MATERIAL THAT PERSONS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WEBSITES AND SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE TO EVALUATE AND BEAR ANY RISKS RELATING TO YOUR USE OF, OR RELIANCE ON, ANY

                    SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AFFILIATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COTTON BUREAU SERVICES, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW (INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY,
                    AND INFRINGEMENT) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US.</p>
                <h3>Disputes</h3>
                <p>We hope and trust that our relationship will always be satisfactory. In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between us, you agree that the following terms will apply:</p>
                <ul class="Text-list--fancy">
                    <li>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Cotton Bureau services, websites, or operations,
                        or arising out or related to of our relationship or this agreement, must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<a id="gdpr"></a></li>
                    <li>Any disputes arising out of your use of our services, websites, or operations, or arising out of or related to our relationship or this agreement, shall be governed by the
                        ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AGREEMENT REGARDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES included below.</li>
                    <li>Subject to the provisions of the ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AGREEMENT REGARDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, which shall control, You and Cotton Bureau agree to submit to the personal and
                        exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, or courts having appellate jurisdiction over those courts. If you live in a country with laws
                        that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph does not override those rights.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms will be governed by Pennsylvania law except for its conflicts of laws principles. Some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to
                    be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country or require that their substantive laws, including privacy laws, apply. This section does not override those laws.</p>
                <h3>Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>
                <p>You agree that Cotton Bureau’s employees, representatives, management, and affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of Cotton Bureau’s rights under this agreement.</p>
                <p>There are no other third-party beneficiaries of this agreement.</p>
                <h3>Entire Agreement and Severability to Conform to Law</h3>
                <p>This is the entire agreement between you and Cotton Bureau, replacing any earlier agreements between you and us, regarding your use of our services and websites.</p>
                <p>No person has the authority to alter or waive our rights or your obligations under these terms unless an officer or counsel of Cotton Bureau executes a document agreeing to such an
                    alteration or waiver.</p>
                <p>If a court determines any provision of this Agreement to be illegal or unenforceable, the parties agree to sever that provision from this Agreement, with all other provisions remaining
                    in force.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Additional Terms of Agreement Regarding Arbitration of Disputes</h2>
                <p>Cotton Bureau believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Cotton Bureau customer support. If You are a U.S. customer, and the dispute is
                    not resolved through Cotton Bureau customer support, You and Cotton Bureau agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software and
                    Services or this License Agreement (a “Claim”), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows:</p>
                <h3>Small Claims Court</h3>
                <p>You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at
                    issue in the dispute. You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the United States.</p>
                <h3>Arbitration</h3>
                <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject
                    to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  You agree that, by agreeing to this License Agreement, the U.S. Federal
                    Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that You and Cotton Bureau are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
                    in a class action.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this License Agreement and/or the termination of Your Cotton Bureau product license.</p>
                <p><strong>Notice of Claim:</strong> If You elect to seek arbitration, You must first send to Cotton Bureau, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim ("Notice of Claim").  The
                    Notice of Claim to Cotton Bureau should be addressed to: Nathan Peretic, Cotton Bureau, 110 Torrens St. Suite 101, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 and should be prominently captioned “NOTICE OF
                    CLAIM”.  The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like Cotton Bureau to use to contact You. If Cotton Bureau elects to seek arbitration,
                    it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to Your billing address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by You or by Cotton Bureau, must (a) describe the nature and
                    basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand"); and (c) whether You reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute
                    Resolution section by Cotton Bureau (see Section 12(B)(e)).</p>
                <p><strong>Arbitration Proceedings:</strong> If You and Cotton Bureau do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, You or
                    Cotton Bureau may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).  You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate
                    arbitration at www.adr.org.  The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
                    (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this License Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.  The
                    arbitrator is bound by the terms of this License Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
                    provision.</p>
                <p>Unless Cotton Bureau and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either Your residence or of the mailing address You provided in Your
                    Notice of Claim.  If Your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Cotton Bureau agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
                    submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If Your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will
                    be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                    essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
                <p><strong>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief:</strong> Except as set forth in the Small Claims Court provision above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits
                    of any claim asserted by You or Cotton Bureau, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
                    provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that You or Cotton Bureau prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that
                    has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the
                    merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
                <p><strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong> If Your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Cotton Bureau will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including
                    reimbursement of Your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was
                    brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If Your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will
                    govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.</p>
                <p><strong>Class Action Waiver: YOU AND Cotton Bureau AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
                        ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>  Further, if You have elected arbitration, unless both You and Cotton Bureau agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                    consolidate more than one person’s claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to
                    be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
                <p><strong>Modification of Dispute Resolution Section:</strong> If Cotton Bureau changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date You first accepted this License Agreement, and You
                    have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, You may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim. By failing to reject any changes to this Dispute
                    Resolution section in Your Notice of Claim, You agree to resolve any Claim between You and Cotton Bureau in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of
                    the date of Your Notice of Claim.</p>
                <p><strong>Severability:</strong>  With the exception of the Class Action Waiver provisions noted above, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this
                    Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.</p>
