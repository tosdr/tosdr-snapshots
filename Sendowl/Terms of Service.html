The first month is a free trial meaning the first payment is not made until one month after joining. During the trial the Merchant must enter payment details (either debit/credit card, or PayPal subscription) to pay the monthly fee for using the Service. By continuing to use the Service, the Merchant is authorizing Send Owl to charge the Merchants chosen payment method to pay for the ongoing cost of membership. Should payment details not be entered during the trial the Merchant will be suspended from the Service and will no longer be able to access the benefits of membership.</p><p>Should a payment be missed (for example, due an expired credit card), SendOwl will contact the Merchant to inform them of the problem. The Merchant will then have 14 days to make payment before their account is suspended. Such a period for a missed payment only applies after a successful payment in a previous month has been made. Suspension is immediate after the first month’s trial if incorrect payment details have been entered.</p><p>SendOwl offers a series of plans that give different levels of membership benefits. Merchants are able to upgrade or downgrade their plan at any point by visiting the Account section of the site. When downgrading the new monthly amount will be charged on the next billing cycle.

The new monthly charge will then apply from the next bill day.</p><p>From time to time, SendOwl may alter the benefits provided by each of the plans. Should this be the case, Merchants will be notified and given 30 days to decide whether they stay on the same plan, move to a different one, or cancel their membership.</p><p>For each membership payment made, an invoice email is sent to the Merchant and a copy stored in their account.

You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services or as a consumer of our services, to any advertising or marketing communications regarding us or our Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through the Services that you received as a consumer, or to any aspect of your relationship or transactions with us as a consumer of our services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or SendOwl may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement.<br/><br/>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SENDOWL, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.

This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to<!-- --> <a href="mailto:arbitration-proceedings@sendowl.com">arbitration-proceedings@sendowl.com</a>. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at<!-- --> <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at<!-- --> <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from JAMS, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</li><li><u>Arbitrator Powers</u>. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and SendOwl. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and SendOwl.</li><li><u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u>. YOU AND SENDOWL WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and SendOwl are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in paragraph (a) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</li><li><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</u>. YOU AND SENDOWL AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor SendOwl is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in the Section “Exclusive Venue” below.</li><li><u>Opt Out</u>. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor SendOwl can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must notify SendOwl in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your email address (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to:<!-- --> <a href="mailto:opt-out-arbitration@sendowl.com">opt-out-arbitration@sendowl.com</a>.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with us.</li><li><u>Modification</u>. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to us.</li></ul></div></section><section class="Section_section__gjwvr"><div class="Section_inner__M2sHS"><h4>Exclusive Venue</h4><p>To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and SendOwl agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively within the State of California for courts situated in San Francisco County, California, or in federal court for the Northern District of California.</p></div></section><section class="Section_section__gjwvr"><div class="Section_inner__M2sHS"><h4>Violation of Terms of Service and/or Acceptable Use Policy</h4><p>Violations of any of the terms outlined in the TOS or any of the conditions outlined in the AUP may result in the suspension or termination of your account without prior notice.
