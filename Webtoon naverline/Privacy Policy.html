Nous divulguons ou partageons des données à caractère personnel vous concernant via les Services comme décrit dans les sections qui suivent :<br>
		- <strong>Données accessibles au public</strong>. Les données pour lesquelles vous avez volontairement accepté qu’elles soient partagées avec le public, peuvent être consultées par toute personne, y compris celles ne disposant pas d’un compte. Ces données peuvent inclure votre pseudonyme, votre photo de profil, votre brève biographie, vos liens vers des réseaux sociaux, votre site web, d'autres données présentes sur votre profil public ainsi que toute information ou contenu que vous partagez avec le public.<br>
		- <strong>Prestataires de services</strong>. Nous pouvons divulguer vos données à des sociétés fournissant des Services pour notre compte, comme  des sociétés qui nous aident à développer et à exploiter des systèmes pour le Service avec des centres de contact client, ainsi que des activités de service client et de la publicité (y compris de la publicité personnalisée sur nos sites web, des sites web tiers ou des plateformes en ligne), à réaliser des enquêtes de satisfaction client et des opérations de facturation ou à envoyer des emails pour notre compte. Ces entités sont contractuellement limitées dans leur capacité à utiliser vos données à des fins autres que la fourniture de Services à notre demande.<br>
		En agissant en tant que prestataires de services conformément aux lois applicables, ces fournisseurs peuvent avoir accès à vos données à caractère personnel afin de fournir les services et/ou de se conformer aux obligations découlant des relations juridiques qui existent entre les tiers susmentionnés et nous. Dans tous les cas, nous avons signé les accords de confidentialité et de protection des données correspondants avec ces prestataires de services, en totale conformité avec la législation actuelle sur la protection des données.<br>
		- <strong>Partenaires de paiement</strong>. Nos partenaires de paiement collectent et traitent des données liées aux paiements et achats à des fins de traitement des paiements et de lutte contre la fraude.<br>
		- <strong>Partenaires Publicitaires</strong>. Nous pouvons partager votre information afin de vous fournir des publicités plus adaptées et aider à mesurer l'efficacité de celles-ci.<br>
		- <strong>Partenaires Marketing</strong>. Nous pouvons partager votre information afin de vous permettre de participer à nos promotions, promouvoir nos Services dans d'autres plateformes, et mesurer l'efficacité de nos activités Marketing.<br>
		- <strong>Nos Sociétés Affiliées</strong>. Nous pouvons partager votre information personnelle avec nos filiales pour des buts décrits dans cette Politique de Confidentialité.<br>
		- <strong>Autres parties en cas d’exigence légale ou de nécessité pour la protection de nos Services</strong>. Dans certains cas, nous pouvons divulguer vos données à d’autres parties :<br>
		- pour nous conformer aux lois ou à une procédure judiciaire obligatoire (par exemple mandat de perquisition ou autre injonction judiciaire) ;<br>
		- pour vérifier ou imposer la conformité aux politiques qui régissent nos Services ; et<br>
		- pour protéger nos droits, nos biens ou notre sécurité ou, conformément aux lois sur la protection des données, l’une de nos filiales respectives, partenaires commerciaux ou clients.<br>
		- <strong>Autres parties en lien avec des transactions</strong>. Nous pouvons divulguer vos données à un tiers dans le cadre d’une fusion ou d’une cession, d’une acquisition ou d’une vente, ou en cas de faillite.<br>
		- <strong>Autres parties avec votre consentement ou à votre demande</strong>. En plus des cas de divulgation décrits dans la présente Politique de protection des données, nous pouvons partager des données vous concernant avec des tiers lorsque vous acceptez ou demandez séparément ce partage.<br>
		- <strong>Liens vers d'autres sites web, appareils, applications et fonctions</strong>. Le Service peut vous donner la possibilité de vous connecter à d'autres sites web, appareils, applications et fonctions, dont le fonctionnement peut nous être indépendant et être soumis à leurs propres déclarations ou politiques de protection des données, que nous vous conseillons vivement de consulter. Dans la mesure où tout autre site web lié, appareil, application ou autre fonction n’est pas notre propriété ou échappe à notre contrôle, nous ne sommes pas responsables de son contenu, de son utilisation ou de ses pratiques en matière de protection des données.
	</p>
	<h4 id="pp_5_fr">5. Conservation des données à caractère personnel</h4>
	<p>
		Nous prenons des mesures appropriées pour garantir que nous traitons et conservons les données vous concernant selon la logique suivante :<br>
		- pendant la durée minimale pendant laquelle les données sont utilisées pour vous fournir un service ;<br>
		- en application des lois, d’un contrat ou en lien avec nos obligations légales (par exemple en matière fiscale) ; ou<br>
		- uniquement pendant la durée requise pour les finalités pour lesquelles les données ont été collectées, sont traitées, ou plus longtemps en application d’un contrat, de lois applicables, ou sous forme anonymisée, à des fins statistiques, avec les garanties appropriées.<br><br>
		Nous ne conservons donc vos données à caractère personnel qu’aussi longtemps que nous en avons besoin pour les finalités pour lesquelles nous les collectons et pour nous conformer à des exigences juridiques, financières, commerciales ou de déclaratives. Lorsque nous n’avons plus besoin des données à caractère personnel, nous les supprimons ou détruisons de manière sécurisée. Une fois ces finalités réalisées, vos données à caractère personnel seront supprimées ou détruites de manière sécurisée.<br><br>
		Nous continuons néanmoins à stocker les données collectées après cette date jusqu’à l’expiration de toute obligation juridique en découlant.
	</p>
	<h4 id="pp_6_fr">6. Vos droits</h4>
	<p>Vos données à caractère personnel vous appartiennent. En fonction du territoire dans lequel vous résidez, vous pouvez nous demander des données détaillées sur les données que nous avons collectées et nous demander de rectifier toute inexactitude.

		<strong>Transfert international de données</strong><br>
		En outre, votre utilisation des Services peut impliquer le transfert, le stockage et le traitement de vos données à caractère personnel dans d'autres pays. L’on retrouve notamment parmi ces pays, et de manière non exhaustive, les pays de l’Espace Économique Européen, les États-Unis, le Japon, la Thaïlande, l’Indonésie, Taïwan, les Philippines et la République de Corée. Nous prendrons toutes les mesures appropriées, conformément aux lois applicables, pour assurer la protection de vos données à caractère personnel. Ces mesures comprennent par exemple l’utilisation des Clauses contractuelles types de la Commission européenne, lorsque celles-ci sont applicables, afin de sécuriser le transfert de données hors de l’EEE et la demande de votre consentement explicite. Par ailleurs, la Commission européenne reconnaît que certains pays et territoires situés hors de l’EEE assurent un niveau de protection adéquat des données à caractère personnel – par le biais de décisions auxquelles il est fait référence par l’expression « décisions d'adéquation ». Lorsque nous transférons des données à caractère personnel depuis l’EEE vers des pays tiers qui ont obtenu ces décisions d'adéquation, nous ne sommes pas obligés de mettre en place des mécanismes alternatifs pour légitimer le transfert (tels que des clauses contractuelles types). Pour demander des données supplémentaires ou obtenir une copie des accords contractuels ou autres mesures de protection mises en place, veuillez nous contacter. Voir la section <a href="#pp_10_fr">Nous contacter</a> ci-dessus.<br><br>
		<strong>Prise de décision automatisée</strong><br>
		Nous ne prenons pas de décision pouvant vous affecter sur la seule base du traitement automatisé de vos données à caractère personnel. Toutes les procédures de prise de décision liées aux finalités de traitement susmentionnées sont effectuées avec une intervention humaine.<br><br>
		<strong>Données à caractère personnel des mineurs</strong><br>
		Avant que vous puissiez utiliser nos services, nous vous demandons de nous communiquer des données sur votre âge pour nous aider à respecter les lois sur la protection des données. Plus spécifiquement, nous vous demandons votre date de naissance afin de déterminer si vous êtes ou non autorisé à utiliser les services, ou si nous devons obtenir le consentement parental vérifiable d’un de vos parents, ou de la personne détentrice de l’autorité légale, avant de vous autoriser à accéder aux services ou à les utiliser. Si le consentement parental des parents ou responsables légaux de l’utilisateur est requis, nous obtenons ce consentement avant de traiter les données à caractère personnel de mineurs.<br><br>
