<strong>Exhibit A</strong>
</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>
This Exhibit A to the Agreement describes the further provisions which apply to the Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
<ol type='A'>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Disputes:</strong>
A dispute is any controversy between You and COMPANY concerning the Services, any software related to the Services, the price of the Services, Your account, COMPANY’s advertising, marketing, or communications, Your purchase transaction or billing, or any term of this Agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of Your or COMPANY’s intellectual property rights. As part of the best efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute, what efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing party is requesting as resolution, to legal@COMPANY.us.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Small Claims Court Available:</strong>
You may initiate an action in your local Small Claims Court if You meets the court’s requirements. However, if such a claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court, COMPANY reserves the right to require arbitration.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Arbitration Procedure:</strong>
Disputes not resolved pursuant to Section A or B shall be resolved through arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. For more information, see www.adr.org. Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of Your primary business location. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must: (a) follow all applicable substantive Law; (b) follow applicable statutes of limitations; (c) honor valid claims of privilege; (d) issue a written decision including the reasons for the award. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees). Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim; however, a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong>
If You are unable to afford the arbitration costs, COMPANY will advance those costs to You, subject to the arbitrator’s determination if costs should be reimbursed to COMPANY if COMPANY prevails. For disputes involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules:</strong>
This Agreement governs if there is a conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Requirement to File Within One Year:</strong>
Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, a claim or dispute under this Agreement must be filed in Small Claims Court or noticed for arbitration within one year of when it could first be filed, or such claim will be permanently barred.
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<strong>Severability:</strong>
If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration. If any provision of this Exhibit A is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original intent of this Exhibit, inclusive of the severed provision.
