            10. Data Transfers
          </h2>

          <p>
            In certain cases, we need to transfer your information to recipients outside the European Economic Area (&lsquo;<strong>EEA</strong>&rsquo;), such as where it is necessary to provide the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where we transfer your information, we do so in accordance with EU data protection law. We only transfer personal information to these countries when it is necessary for the services we provide you, or it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your information. We may rely on different legal mechanisms to ensure the transfer is lawful. If the recipient is in a country that is not deemed &lsquo;adequate&rsquo; by the European Commission, we may enter into the &lsquo;standard contractual clauses&rsquo; with the recipient. These are contracts that contain standard commitments approved by the EU Commission protecting the privacy and security of the information transferred.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that the privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in some of these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We will only transfer information as permitted by law.
          </p>

          <p>

            11. Retention
          </h2>

          <p>
            We may retain your information for as long as necessary in light of the purposes set out in this Notice, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements and, where required for RANDOM.ORG to assert or defend against legal claims, until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.
          </p>

          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We also consider regulatory and guidance issued by the Data Protection Commission.
          </p>
