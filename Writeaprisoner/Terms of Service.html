Welcome to WriteAPrisoner.com, a website that helps connect inmates with non-incarcerated pen-pals. These Terms of Service (“Terms”), together with our Privacy Policy, constitute a written contract (the “Agreement”) between WriteAPrisoner.com, Inc. (“WriteAPrisoner,” “we,” “us”) on the one hand, and on the other, you and any inmate on whose behalf you are creating an Account (collectively,&amp;nbsp;“you”) governing your use of WriteAPrisoner.com (the&amp;nbsp;“Site”) and/or any other sites, mobile apps, services or software where these Terms appear or are linked (collectively with the Site, the&amp;nbsp;“Services”).

By using the Services, you represent that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement and that you are&amp;nbsp;at least 18 years old.

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, then you may not access the Services.

These terms contain provisions that require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. See Section 10 for full details.

1. PRIVACY POLICY

We take your privacy very seriously; as such, our Privacy Policy is an important part of this Agreement. The Privacy Policy explains how we collect information from you and how we use and share that information to provide our Services.

2. ABOUT THE SERVICES

What We Do

Our Site helps connect inmates who are seeking non-incarcerated pen-pals with whom to correspond.

Since our inception, we have expanded from providing pen-pal services to providing inmates with the opportunity to post legal, employment, and reintegration profiles; organizing book donations; and services aimed directly toward reducing recidivism and raising awareness. Upon release, we also provide inmates with reintegration kits and various self-help documents.

What We Don’t Do


	We do not do background checks on any user of the Services, including inmates. The information in each inmate’s profile, including criminal charges and convictions, is provided by the inmate with no research or any other form of confirmation by us. Only in select circumstances, when the option is available, do we verify basic inmate information made available through government websites.
	We do not provide legal services, legal referrals, or legal advice.
	We are not a dating site (we encourage friendly communication rather than romantic).
	Upon release, we do not provide inmates with housing, employment, financial or other assistance.


How We Make Money

To ensure that we can continue to provide and improve our Services, we earn money by showing advertisements on our Site and in our newsletters. By continuing to use our Site and Services, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote. We may use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you. Please review our Privacy Policy for additional information on how we collect and use your information.

3. YOUR QUALIFICATIONS

You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to create an Account or use the Services; this restriction applies to both inmates and non-incarcerated users. If you are creating an Account on behalf of an inmate, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on the inmate’s behalf and that all information you provide is accurate and current.

4. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES

License to Use the Services

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, WriteAPrisoner grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to access and use the Services. This license allows you to use the Services, but does not allow you to reproduce, duplicate, copy, modify, sell, or otherwise exploit any portion of the Services without our prior express written consent. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by WriteAPrisoner.

Common Sense

If you are a pen-pal, you agree to use common sense and assume all responsibility for your communications with an inmate or other users that are initiated through the Services. As with any internet-based service that allows you to communicate with persons that were previously unknown to you, you should use caution in disclosing personal information about yourself, including your full name, address, details about your finances or family, and so forth.

Your Representation of an Inmate

Some penal institutions do not allow inmates access to the Internet to register for the Services and, as such, inmates rely on family and friends to create their Accounts and profile for them.

WriteAPrisoner respects the intellectual property rights of others. We follow the notice and takedown procedures in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;).

Under the DMCA, you may be held liable for damages based on material misrepresentations in your Infringement Notice. You must also make a good-faith evaluation of whether the use of your Content is a fair use; fair uses are not infringing.

This includes any transactions conducted through the Site as well as the collection, handling and sharing of personal information to third-parties.

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

This section governs any dispute between you and WriteAPrisoner, and how disputes will be legally resolved, if necessary. Remember, these dispute resolution provisions only apply to disputes between WriteAPrisoner and you, and not to disputes between you and any other user or Third-Party Services.

Governing Law and Venue

You agree that all claims and disputes between you and WriteAPrisoner that arise out of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law principles. Subject to and without waiving the arbitration agreement below, the proper venue for any judicial action arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement will be the state and federal courts located in Volusia County, Florida (a “Court of Competent Jurisdiction”). You and WriteAPrisoner stipulate to, and agree to waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and submit to extraterritorial service of process.&amp;nbsp;

Informal Dispute Resolution 

A “Claim” means and includes any claim or dispute between you and WriteAPrisoner Entities arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Services, any dealings with WriteAPrisoner, any representations or omissions by WriteAPrisoner, or the Site. Our goal is to work together to try and resolve any Claims. Before seeking relief through arbitration, you agree that you will first notify WriteAPrisoner to try and resolve any Claim(s) against WriteAPrisoner Entities. You can contact us by email at general-information@writeaprisoner.com, by fax at 386-202-4225, or by mail at the address listed in Section 5. You understand and acknowledge that participating in this informal process is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration or proceeding. You and WriteAPrisoner will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for 90 days towards the resolution of any Claim, or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing between the parties, from the day you or WriteAPrisoner receives a written notice of a Claim from the other party. 

Arbitration

If you and WriteAPrisoner cannot resolve a dispute or other Claim through negotiations, the dispute or Claim shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. This arbitration agreement is reciprocal, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. All remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. Unless you and the WriteAPrisoner agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence. If you initiate arbitration against WriteAPrisoner, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If WriteAPrisoner initiates arbitration against you, WriteAPrisoner shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and WriteAPrisoner agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and WriteAPrisoner will each pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless an award of attorneys’ fees is available under applicable statute. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

You acknowledge that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial.

NO CLASS ACTIONS

You and WriteAPrisoner agree that any arbitration or legal action shall be limited to the two of us as parties, and any joinder of or other parties is not allowed. This means that&amp;nbsp;you cannot participate in any sort of representative proceeding against WriteAPrisoner, including as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action.

Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief

This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or WriteAPrisoner from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration, or confirm an arbitral award from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or WriteAPrisoner from applying to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.

11. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

YOU KNOWINGLY AND EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Welcome to WriteAPrisoner.com, a website that helps connect inmates with non-incarcerated pen-pals. These Terms of Service (“Terms”), together with our Privacy Policy, constitute a written contract (the “Agreement”) between WriteAPrisoner.com, Inc. (“WriteAPrisoner,” “we,” “us”) on the one hand, and on the other, you and any inmate on whose behalf you are creating an Account (collectively,&amp;nbsp;“you”) governing your use of WriteAPrisoner.com (the&amp;nbsp;“Site”) and/or any other sites, mobile apps, services or software where these Terms appear or are linked (collectively with the Site, the&amp;nbsp;“Services”).

By using the Services, you represent that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement and that you are&amp;nbsp;at least 18 years old.

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, then you may not access the Services.

These terms contain provisions that require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. See Section 10 for full details.

1. PRIVACY POLICY

We take your privacy very seriously; as such, our Privacy Policy is an important part of this Agreement. The Privacy Policy explains how we collect information from you and how we use and share that information to provide our Services.

2. ABOUT THE SERVICES

What We Do

Our Site helps connect inmates who are seeking non-incarcerated pen-pals with whom to correspond.

Since our inception, we have expanded from providing pen-pal services to providing inmates with the opportunity to post legal, employment, and reintegration profiles; organizing book donations; and services aimed directly toward reducing recidivism and raising awareness. Upon release, we also provide inmates with reintegration kits and various self-help documents.

What We Don’t Do


	We do not do background checks on any user of the Services, including inmates. The information in each inmate’s profile, including criminal charges and convictions, is provided by the inmate with no research or any other form of confirmation by us. Only in select circumstances, when the option is available, do we verify basic inmate information made available through government websites.
	We do not provide legal services, legal referrals, or legal advice.
	We are not a dating site (we encourage friendly communication rather than romantic).
	Upon release, we do not provide inmates with housing, employment, financial or other assistance.


How We Make Money

We may use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you. Please review our Privacy Policy for additional information on how we collect and use your information.

3. YOUR QUALIFICATIONS

You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to create an Account or use the Services; this restriction applies to both inmates and non-incarcerated users. If you are creating an Account on behalf of an inmate, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on the inmate’s behalf and that all information you provide is accurate and current.

4. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES

License to Use the Services

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, WriteAPrisoner grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to access and use the Services. This license allows you to use the Services, but does not allow you to reproduce, duplicate, copy, modify, sell, or otherwise exploit any portion of the Services without our prior express written consent. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by WriteAPrisoner.

Common Sense

If you are a pen-pal, you agree to use common sense and assume all responsibility for your communications with an inmate or other users that are initiated through the Services. As with any internet-based service that allows you to communicate with persons that were previously unknown to you, you should use caution in disclosing personal information about yourself, including your full name, address, details about your finances or family, and so forth.

Your Representation of an Inmate

Some penal institutions do not allow inmates access to the Internet to register for the Services and, as such, inmates rely on family and friends to create their Accounts and profile for them. If you are registering an Account, or otherwise interacting with the Services on behalf of an inmate, you agree to be responsible for the Account and the inmate’s participation on the Service. You agree you will indemnify, defend, and hold WriteAPrisoner harmless against any claims, disputes or judgments related to the same. You further agree that you will not knowingly assist any inmate in the violation of any law, prison rule or regulation, or condition of the inmate’s incarceration or parole by interacting with the Service on the inmate’s behalf.

Your Account

To participate in the Services, you must create an Account and profile (collectively, your “Account”). You represent and warrant that all information you provide in connection with your Account and your use of the Services is current, complete, and accurate, and that you will update the information as necessary to keep it accurate. You further represent and warrant that you are not impersonating any person or entity through your Account, or misleading other users as to your affiliation with any person or entity. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials, including your username and password. You agree to notify WriteAPrisoner immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. We reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to: (a) refuse to grant you access to the Services, (b) remove your profile from the Site, (c) terminate your Account, or (d) suspend or terminate your right to use the Services.

Your Content

You may be authorized to post certain information, images, and artwork to the Site (collectively,&amp;nbsp;“Content”). If you are an inmate, your Content may include profile information such as a photo (or original artwork), a short description about yourself, what you are seeking in a pen-pal, poetry, and other background information about yourself so that potential pen-pals can get to know you better. If you are a non-inmate, your Content may include a photo, username,&amp;nbsp;and email address. Whether you are an inmate or not, you represent and warrant that all Content posted by you is current, complete, and accurate. You are required to use common sense and are prohibited from posting any Content that violates any law, rule, or regulation, including any prison rules or conditions of incarceration or probation, infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, is illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, or otherwise violates the Prohibited Conduct section below. If you post inappropriate Content or violate the Prohibited Conduct section, we may, in our sole direction, remove your Content or suspend or delete your Account.

License to Display Your Content

You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Site, however, we require the following license from you in order to be able to display your Content as expressly permitted by you – for example, to make your profile visible to others. You hereby grant WriteAPrisoner an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display your Content throughout the world in any media now existing or in the future created.

Other Users’ Content

WriteAPrisoner respects the intellectual property rights of others. We follow the notice and takedown procedures in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;). Additionally, we will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. If you believe Content located on or linked to the Site violates your copyright, please immediately notify us by emailing us a DMCA takedown notice (&quot;Infringement Notice&quot;), providing the information described below. If we take action in response to an Infringement Notice, we will make a good faith attempt to contact the person or entity who made the Content available at the most recent email address they provided to us.

Under the DMCA, you may be held liable for damages based on material misrepresentations in your Infringement Notice. You must also make a good-faith evaluation of whether the use of your Content is a fair use; fair uses are not infringing. If you are not sure if Content located on or linked to by the Site infringes your copyright, you should first contact an attorney.

The DMCA requires that all Infringement Notices must include the following: (a) a signature, electronic or physical, of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (b) an identification of the copyright claimed to have been infringed; (c) a description of the nature and location of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit WriteAPrisoner to find and positively identify that material; (d) your name, address, telephone number, and email address; and (e) a statement by you: (i) that you believe in good faith that the use of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner&#039;s agent; and, (ii) under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in your Infringement Notice is accurate, and that you are either the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.

All Infringement Notices should be sent to&amp;nbsp;general-information@writeaprisoner.com&amp;nbsp;with the subject line &quot;DMCA Notice&quot;. If you believe your Content was removed by mistake, we also encourage you to contact us.

WriteAPrisoner will respond to all DMCA-compliant Infringement Notices, including, as required or appropriate, by removing the offending material or disabling all links to the offending material.

This includes any transactions conducted through the Site as well as the collection, handling and sharing of personal information to third-parties.

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

This section governs any dispute between you and WriteAPrisoner, and how disputes will be legally resolved, if necessary. Remember, these dispute resolution provisions only apply to disputes between WriteAPrisoner and you, and not to disputes between you and any other user or Third-Party Services.

Governing Law and Venue

You agree that all claims and disputes between you and WriteAPrisoner that arise out of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law principles. Subject to and without waiving the arbitration agreement below, the proper venue for any judicial action arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement will be the state and federal courts located in Volusia County, Florida (a “Court of Competent Jurisdiction”). You and WriteAPrisoner stipulate to, and agree to waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and submit to extraterritorial service of process.&amp;nbsp;

Informal Dispute Resolution 

A “Claim” means and includes any claim or dispute between you and WriteAPrisoner Entities arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Services, any dealings with WriteAPrisoner, any representations or omissions by WriteAPrisoner, or the Site. Our goal is to work together to try and resolve any Claims. Before seeking relief through arbitration, you agree that you will first notify WriteAPrisoner to try and resolve any Claim(s) against WriteAPrisoner Entities. You can contact us by email at general-information@writeaprisoner.com, by fax at 386-202-4225, or by mail at the address listed in Section 5. You understand and acknowledge that participating in this informal process is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration or proceeding. You and WriteAPrisoner will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for 90 days towards the resolution of any Claim, or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing between the parties, from the day you or WriteAPrisoner receives a written notice of a Claim from the other party. 

Arbitration

If you and WriteAPrisoner cannot resolve a dispute or other Claim through negotiations, the dispute or Claim shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. This arbitration agreement is reciprocal, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. All remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. Unless you and the WriteAPrisoner agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence. If you initiate arbitration against WriteAPrisoner, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If WriteAPrisoner initiates arbitration against you, WriteAPrisoner shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and WriteAPrisoner agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and WriteAPrisoner will each pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless an award of attorneys’ fees is available under applicable statute. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

You acknowledge that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial.

NO CLASS ACTIONS

You and WriteAPrisoner agree that any arbitration or legal action shall be limited to the two of us as parties, and any joinder of or other parties is not allowed. This means that&amp;nbsp;you cannot participate in any sort of representative proceeding against WriteAPrisoner, including as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action.

Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief

This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or WriteAPrisoner from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration, or confirm an arbitral award from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or WriteAPrisoner from applying to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.

11. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

You understand and acknowledge that participating in this informal process is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration or proceeding. You and WriteAPrisoner will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for 90 days towards the resolution of any Claim, or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing between the parties, from the day you or WriteAPrisoner receives a written notice of a Claim from the other party. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

This arbitration agreement is reciprocal, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="line-height:15.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"><span style="color:#333333">The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. All remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. Unless you and the WriteAPrisoner agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence. If you initiate arbitration against WriteAPrisoner, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If WriteAPrisoner initiates arbitration against you, WriteAPrisoner shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and WriteAPrisoner agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and WriteAPrisoner will each pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless an award of attorneys’ fees is available under applicable statute. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
