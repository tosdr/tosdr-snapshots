7. How do we protect your information?

We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, it is impossible to guarantee the safety of data. We will do our best to protect your information, but the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Never share your password with anyone else and notify us as soon as possible if you believe your account security has been breached.

8. How long do we keep your information?

WriteAPrisoner retains your information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law or valid court order. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will delete it, or, if this is not possible (for example because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information until deletion is possible.

9. Do we transfer your information to a different country?

If you are visiting the Website from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By using the Website, you authorize and specifically consent to the transfer of personal data to the United States and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us.

10. What are your rights when it comes to accessing, correcting, or deleting your information, and how can you exercise them?

To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please contact us at general-information@writeaprisoner.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

If you are in the European Union, you have certain rights under the GDPR. Under the GDPR you may have the right to request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information we have collected, request rectification or erasure of your personal information, restrict the processing of your personal information, and, if applicable, request data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

Our Website may include advertisements, content, or links to content, products or services provided by third parties. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by WriteAPrisoner through your interaction with the Website. Third-Party Services that may be accessible through links from our Website have their own privacy policies and information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

12. How do we protect the privacy of children?

WriteAPrisoner does not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18.

13. How can you receive and opt-out from marketing communications?

By providing your contact information through the Website or an email initiated by you, you consent to receive emails from us, including information concerning your account and advertising messages.

Providing consent to promotional emails is NOT a condition of purchasing any goods or services from WriteAPrisoner. You can unsubscribe to advertising emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link within the email, or by contacting us at general-information@writeaprisoner.com. Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from advertising emails, we will still send you any necessary, non-promotional emails about your purchase, account, or updates to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

14. Do we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) Signals?

DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked.&amp;nbsp; We do not respond to DNT requests.

15. How will you know when we change the Privacy Policy?

Each time you use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.&amp;nbsp; Although most changes are likely to be minor, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy by posting such modification on this page; however, if changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or email you. Depending upon your location, we may obtain additional consent from you via a checkbox disclosure or an email requesting consent before you can continue to use the Website.

<p><strong>6. Do we sell your information to others?</strong></p>
<p>No, WriteAPrisoner does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose information that reasonably identifies you. We have not sold consumers’ personal information during the past twelve (12) months.</p>
<p><strong>7. How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, it is impossible to guarantee the safety of data. We will do our best to protect your information, but the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Never share your password with anyone else and notify us as soon as possible if you believe your account security has been breached.</p>
<p><strong>8. How long do we keep your information?</strong></p>
<p>WriteAPrisoner retains your information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law or valid court order. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will delete it, or, if this is not possible (for example because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><strong>9. Do we transfer your information to a different country?</strong></p>
<p>If you are visiting the Website from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By using the Website, <strong>you authorize and specifically consent to the transfer of personal data to the United States</strong> and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us.</p>
<p><strong>10. What are your rights when it comes to accessing, correcting, or deleting your information, and how can you exercise them?</strong></p>
<p>Based on the state or country you are located in, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, request changes to your personal information, or in some circumstances request deletion. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3552505b50475459185c5b535a475854415c5a5b7542475c41505445475c465a5b50471b565a58">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

<p><strong>11. Privacy Practices of Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Our Website may include advertisements, content, or links to content, products or services provided by third parties. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by WriteAPrisoner through your interaction with the Website. Third-Party Services that may be accessible through links from our Website have their own privacy policies and information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Third-party sellers, advertisers, and partners also have their own privacy practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these third parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of a third-party offer or promotion.</p>
<p><strong>12. How do we protect the privacy of children?</strong></p>
<p>WriteAPrisoner does not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>13. How can you receive and opt-out from marketing communications?</strong></p>
<p>By providing your contact information through the Website or an email initiated by you, <strong>you consent to receive emails from us, including information concerning your account and advertising messages.</strong> Depending upon your location, we may obtain additional consent from you via a checkbox disclosure or an email requesting confirmation before you can receive such information.</p>
<p>Providing consent to promotional emails is NOT a condition of purchasing any goods or services from WriteAPrisoner. You can unsubscribe to advertising emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link within the email, or by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0a7a5aea5b2a1aceda9aea6afb2ada1b4a9afae80b7b2a9b4a5a1b0b2a9b3afaea5b2eea3afad"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="395e5c575c4b58551450575f564b54584d505657794e4b504d5c58494b504a56575c4b175a5654">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from advertising emails, we will still send you any necessary, non-promotional emails about your purchase, account, or updates to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>14. Do we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) Signals?</strong></p>
<p>DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked.  We do not respond to DNT requests.</p>
<p><strong>15. How will you know when we change the Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p>Each time you use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.  Although most changes are likely to be minor, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy by posting such modification on this page; however, if changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or email you. Depending upon your location, we may obtain additional consent from you via a checkbox disclosure or an email requesting consent before you can continue to use the Website.</p>
<p>Unless we receive your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of such revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier version.</p>
