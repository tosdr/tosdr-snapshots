MM may otherwise disclose your Personal Information in accordance with your consent.</li></ul><h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2><ul><li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing Communications</strong>. If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can let us know by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@forthepeople.com">contact@forthepeople.com</a> or by mail at the address provided below in “Contact Us”. The electronic marketing communications we send may also contain an opt-out mechanism. Please note that it may take up to 10 calendar days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request. Please also contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate.</li><li><strong>Text Messages</strong>. We may offer communications via SMS texts or similar technology sent by MM or our service providers, such as when we send you text messages for customer service, account-related, or marketing purposes. To stop receiving text messages from a short code operated by MM, reply STOP. Note that we may send you a message to confirm receipt of your STOP request. Message and data rates may apply for this service. You can also opt-out of MM marketing texts by emailing us your request and mobile telephone number to <a href="mailto:contact@forthepeople.com">contact@forthepeople.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Cookies</strong>. Most browsers let you remove or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Platform and our Site may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li><li><strong>Advertising Choices</strong>. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and are subject to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can obtain more information about these companies’ information collection practices and opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from participating NAI and DAA members at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and/or the DAA’s website at optout.aboutads.info. You can also limit collection of your information for interest-based ads by blocking third party cookies in your browser settings or using privacy plug-ins or ad blocking software that help you block third party cookies. In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you. Some of the third party advertising companies we may work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms, such as Google (<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>) and Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/ads</a>), or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.</li><li><strong>Declining to Provide Information</strong>. We need to collect personal information to provide certain services. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide those services.</li></ul><h2>INFORMATION SECURITY</h2><p>MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the personal information we collect. Nevertheless, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks.</p><h2>LINKED WEBSITES</h2><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or social media features that may be accessed through links that we provide for your convenience and information. Accessing those links will cause you to leave MM’s website and may result in the collection of information about you by a third party. We do not control, endorse or make any representations about those third party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site you interact with before allowing the collection and use of your information.</p><h2>DO NOT TRACK REQUESTS</h2><p>We adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and do not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests.

Please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated, and other locations outside of your home country. The data protection and other laws of these countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using any portion of the Platform, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2><p>We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information online from children under the age of 16. Please contact us as provided below in the Contact Us section if you believe we may have collected such information.</p><h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2><p>This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share personal information of California residents when we act as a “business” as defined under California privacy law, and their rights with respect to their personal information. For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning given under California privacy law but does not include information exempted from the scope of those laws. In some situations we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, whereby that notice will apply instead of this section.</p><p>California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Platform who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@forthepeople.com">contact@forthepeople.com</a>.</p><p>In addition, the state of California provides California residents with certain other rights concerning their personal information. This section describes (1) the categories of personal information, collected and disclosed by MM, subject to California privacy law, (2) your privacy rights under California privacy law, and (3) how to exercise your rights.</p><p><strong>Personal Information That We Collect, Use, and Disclose</strong></p><p>In accordance with California law, we describe:</p><ul class="li-mb-0"><li>the categories of personal information we may have collected about you in the preceding 12 months and the categories of sources from which we collected your personal information in the section above called “Types of Personal Information We Collect”;</li><li>the business and commercial purposes for which we collect this information in the section above called “Use of Personal Information”; and</li><li>the categories of third parties to whom we disclose this information in the section above called “Sharing of Personal Information”.</li></ul><p>MM must also disclose whether the following categories of personal information are disclosed for a “business purpose” or “valuable consideration” as those terms are defined under California privacy law, which also calls this latter category a “sale.” Note that while a category below may be marked, that does not necessarily mean that we have personal information in that category about you.</p><p>In the preceding twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information in the manner described:</p><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong><u>Category</u></strong></p></td><td><p><strong><u>Personal Information is Disclosed for a Business Purpose</u></strong></p></td><td><p><strong><u>PurposePersonal Information is Disclosed for Valuable Consideration</u></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>A.
