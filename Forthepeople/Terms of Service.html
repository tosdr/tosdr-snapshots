The information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition or for any questions you may have regarding a health concern.

MM Is Not Responsible for Content; Limitation on Liability MM may periodically change, remove, or add the material on the Site without notice.

MM assumes no liability or responsibility for any errors or omissions in the contents of the Site. Your use of the Site is at your own risk. Under no circumstances shall MM or any other party involved in the creation, production or delivery of the Site be liable to you or any other person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind arising from your access to, or use of, the Site. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN NO EVENT SHALL MM BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS MATERIAL, FOR ANY USE OF THIS WEBSITE, OR FOR ANY OTHER LINKED WEBSITE.

State Laws Vary MM has lawyers that are licensed to practice law in all 50 states and Washington DC. MM may refer prospective clients to other law firms located throughout the country, who form relationships with MM, and are experienced in handling such cases. MM may also undertake legal representation in certain cases, and will affiliate with other legal counsel located throughout the country to provide legal representation. The laws of each State are different. The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states. The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases. You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state. The Statute of Limitations is especially important. Every state has laws called the “statute of limitations” which set a deadline to file a lawsuit. That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendant’s fault or the severity of the injuries. Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims; the time period in other states may be longer or shorter. Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss. Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months. Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible. MM Clients Only individuals who have entered into a mutually signed retainer agreement with MM are MM clients (“MM Clients”). Certain portions of the Site designated as such by MM, such as the “My Case” feature of the mobile application, may be available for use only by MM Clients. When MM Clients use such portions of the Site designated by MM to communicate with us pursuant to our representation of a MM Client, we will ensure that any information provided pursuant to such attorney/client relationship may not be shared with third parties except as is done with such precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the relevant information and any attorney/client privilege as may attach to such information. MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the information that we collect. Legal and Ethical Requirements MM has tried to comply with all legal and ethical requirements in compiling the Site. We welcome comments about our compliance with the applicable rules and will update the Site as warranted, upon learning of any new or different requirements. To the extent that the professional responsibility rules of any jurisdiction require us to designate a principal office or an attorney responsible for the Site, Morgan &amp; Morgan, P.A. designates its office in Orlando, Florida (USA), 20 North Orange Avenue, Suite 1600, and attorney Alexander Clem.   Advertising Disclosures Some materials on the Platform may constitute lawyer advertising.

Links do not imply that we sponsor, endorse, are affiliated with or associated with, or are legally authorized to use any trademark, trade name, service mark, design, logo, symbol, or other copyrighted materials displayed on or accessible through any linked site.</p><h4>State Laws Vary</h4><p>MM has lawyers that are licensed to practice law in all 50 states and Washington DC.&nbsp;MM may refer prospective clients to other law firms located throughout the country, who form relationships with MM, and are experienced in handling such cases. MM may also undertake legal representation in certain cases, and will affiliate with other legal counsel located throughout the country to provide legal representation. The laws of each State are different. The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states. The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases. You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state. The Statute of Limitations is especially important. Every state has laws called the “statute of limitations” which set a deadline to file a lawsuit. That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendant’s fault or the severity of the injuries. Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims; the time period in other states may be longer or shorter. Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss. Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months. Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible.</p><h4>MM Clients</h4><p>Only individuals who have entered into a mutually signed retainer agreement with MM are MM clients (“MM Clients”). Certain portions of the Site designated as such by MM, such as the “My Case” feature of the mobile application, may be available for use only by MM Clients. When MM Clients use such portions of the Site designated by MM to communicate with us pursuant to our representation of a MM Client, we will ensure that any information provided pursuant to such attorney/client relationship may not be shared with third parties except as is done with such precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the relevant information and any attorney/client privilege as may attach to such information. MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the information that we collect.</p><h4>Legal and Ethical Requirements</h4><p>MM has tried to comply with all legal and ethical requirements in compiling the Site. We welcome comments about our compliance with the applicable rules and will update the Site as warranted, upon learning of any new or different requirements. To the extent that the professional responsibility rules of any jurisdiction require us to designate a principal office or an attorney responsible for the Site, Morgan &amp; Morgan, P.A. designates its office in Orlando, Florida (USA), 20 North Orange Avenue, Suite 1600, and attorney Alexander Clem.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Advertising Disclosures</h4><p dir="ltr">Some materials on the Platform may constitute lawyer advertising. The choice of a lawyer is an important decision, and it should never be based solely upon an advertisement. Before making your choice of any attorney, you should give this matter careful thought. The selection of an attorney is an important decision. Cases will be handled by attorneys licensed in the local jurisdiction.. Before you decide, you may ask us to send you free written information about our qualifications and experience. FREE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. No representation is made that the lawyers are certified specialists or experts in any field of law. And no representation is made that the legal services to be performed are greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Anyone considering a lawyer should independently investigate the lawyer’s credentials and ability, and not rely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed expertise. No representation is made here about your specific rights. Every case is different and must be judged on its own merits. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome. Contingent attorney fees are negotiable and not set by law. Costs and fees are charged only upon monetary recovery. Not available in all states. Cases may be handled in association with, or referred to, other law firms as co-counsel or referral counsel. Only the law firm’s non-lawyer staffed call center is open 24 hours a day / 7 days a week.</p>&nbsp;<p dir="ltr">Alabama: Erby Fischer, Esq., 216 Summit Blvd, Suite 300, Birmingham, AL 35243</p><p dir="ltr">Arkansas: Bobby F.
