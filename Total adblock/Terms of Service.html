  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”), End User License Agreement, and other documents referenced herein (collectively,
    the “Agreement”) are a binding agreement between Total Security Limited (incorporated in England under number
    10161957) doing business (or trading) as TotalAdBlock (“Total Security Group”, “we,” “us,” or
    “our”) and you (“you,” “yourself,” “User,” or “Customer”). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of
    your use of all Total Security Group's products and services (collectively, the “Services”). Within the scope of
    such Services, this Agreement covers both (i) your service plan; and (ii) any additional services you order to
    supplement your service plan, as further described on Our Services & Prices page. By accessing, using, purchasing
    any product or service offered by us, or registering for or receiving any of the Services, you are agreeing to be
    bound by this Agreement.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you do not accept and agree to this Agreement then you must not access or use the Services.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong> IMPORTANT NOTICE: YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION
      WAIVER SET FORTH BELOW WHICH REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND WAIVE YOUR RIGHT
      TO A COURT HEARING, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>For Users in the United States: Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong>
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us by email
      at <a href='mailto:complaints@totaladblock.com'>complaints@totaladblock.com</a> or by mail at Total Security US LLC, Attention: Legal, WeWork Giralda
      Place, 2222 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Blvd Miami, FL33134, to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally.
      You and Total Security Group agree that we will resolve any disputes between us that cannot be resolved through
      such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days through binding and final arbitration instead of
      through court proceedings. You and Total Security Group hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim
      (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or disputes arising between you and Total Security
      Group relating to these Terms of Service, End User License Agreement,
      <a target='_blank' href='https://www.totaladblock.com/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a>, any purchase you make from Total Security Group,
      any communications between you and Total Security Group (either directly or through a third party), and/or any
      aspect of our relationship with you (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with
      the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”). The AAA’s Rules are
      available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The
      arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance
      with the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator in the English language in
      a location mutually agreed upon by us, or telephonically. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will
      be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator
      shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction,
      validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Service, End User License
      Agreement, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.totaladblock.com/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a>, this arbitration provision, and any other terms
      incorporated by reference into this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to
      determine whether any dispute is arbitrable.
    </li>

    <li>
      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. In all other
      respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited
      to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
      or Total Security Group from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Total
      Security Group also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Total
      Security Group retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including
      preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver
      of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement.
    </li>

    <li>
      The arbitrator shall follow the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended. In all other respects,
      the substantive law of the state of Delaware shall apply, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>
        NEITHER YOU NOR TOTAL SECURITY GROUP MAY ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, NOR
        PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM. CLAIMS MAY NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A
        CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE ONLY YOUR OR TOTAL SECURITY GROUP'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.
        THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY
        SITUATED.
      </strong>
    </li>

    <li>
      If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be
      of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Mandatory Arbitration Provision and Class
      Action Waiver shall continue in full force and effect, except that if the class action waiver is held
      unenforceable then this entire arbitration agreement shall be deemed unenforceable
    </li>

    <li>
      If any claim or dispute is found by the arbitrator to be excluded from this arbitration agreement above, the
      parties agree that any such claim or dispute shall be exclusively brought in and decided by the state or federal
      courts located in Delaware.
    </li>

    <li>This Section of the Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Total Security Group.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>
        30 DAY RIGHT TO OPT-OUT. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT AND NOT BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS
        ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION OF THESE TERMS BY SENDING WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DECISION TO
        OPT-OUT BY EMAILING US AT <a href='mailto:waiveroption@totaladblock.com'>waiveroption@totaladblock.com</a>. THE NOTICE MUST BE SENT WITHIN THIRTY
        (30) DAYS OF ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, OTHERWISE YOU SHALL BE BOUND TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
        TERMS OF THOSE SECTIONS. IF YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, WE ALSO WILL NOT BE BOUND BY
        THEM.
      </strong>
    </li>

    <li>
      YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF
      YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT
      YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN
      ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
      PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
    </li>

    <li>

          <strong>While Using Our Services.</strong> When you install or use one of our Services, it will run in the
          background of your device or environment to help predict threats and better protect you, your devices, and
          your information. We may automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services as well

          <strong>Data Breach Search.</strong> Total Security Group uses a third-party service provider to conduct a
          regular search of current or ongoing data breaches. The third-party provider searches a proprietary database
          of publicly available information concerning data breaches and other online data breach incidents based on the
          email address provided by a user. Total Security Group is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of
          the results of any such search, nor are we affiliated with any website or brand that is listed. Whilst the
          Total Security Group can provide data breach results, we are not held responsible for the data shown, and nor
          do we claim to prevent future data breaches or detect all data breaches. No one can prevent all data breaches.
          We also reserve the right to conduct a data breach search on your behalf to enable us to provide you with
          informative feedback on whether or not you have been previously affected by a known data breach.

      </h4>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Term and Automatic Renewal.</strong> The initial subscription term for the Services will be
          the term you selected at the time you purchased the Services (e.g., either monthly or 12 months) (the “Initial
          Term”). Except in the case of trial offers, the Services will automatically renew for the same term length
          (each a “Renewal Term”) as the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any Renewal Terms shall be collectively
          referred to as the “Term.” All monthly and 12-month subscriptions will renew automatically at the end of the
          Term unless and until you cancel your subscription. To avoid being charged for an additional term, you must
          cancel before the end of the Term. A notice will be sent to you 30 days before your subscription automatically
          renews (the “Renewal Notice”). The Renewal Notice will be sent to the email address you have registered on
          file for your Total Security Group account and notice of auto renewal will appear in your control panel. It
          may be necessary for us to amend your renewal Term to provide you with the best service possible. Should this
          happen, you will be notified via email. It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address and other
          personal details in your user account remains current.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discount Promotions.</strong> If you receive a discount on your Initial Term, your Services will
          automatically renew at the then current non-discounted price listed on our pricing page. You acknowledge,
          agree, and authorize Total Security Group to automatically charge the applicable fee to your payment method in
          accordance with
          the <a href="#pricing-billing-and-payment">Pricing,     Billing and Payment</a> terms
          herein.

          previously requested a chargeback that we have successfully challenged, your Services will not automatically
          renew at the end of your existing service term. We are unable to return disputed charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trial Licenses.</strong> If you requested and received a free seven (7)-day or thirty (30)-day trial
          license, Total Security Group grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and limited
          license to use the Services via the Total Security Group Software only during such the trial or evaluation
          period in accordance with this Agreement. The free trial and evaluation license is only valid for your use of
          the Services via the Total Security Group Services on one device during the seven (7)-day or thirty (30)-day
          period and is limited to one trial license per calendar year, per device. Your trial license to use the
          Services will automatically terminate upon the expiration or termination of the trial license period unless
          you purchase a full subscription to the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Our Continuous Protection Service</strong> provides complimentary access to a range of value-added
          services. In order for these to be utilized you must have your auto-renewal preferences enabled, which can be
          found in 'My Services' within your account and maintain an active billing relationship with us. Once this
          relationship has been terminated, access to the value-added services which are included within the Continuous
          Protection service will be restricted within a 48- hour period of disabling and only accessible again once

          services you have ordered. If the Services you purchase from Total Security Group are billed on a monthly
          basis, you will be billed in full month increments. If our initial attempt to charge your payment method for
          the full subscription charge fails, we may reattempt to charge your payment method in separate charges that
          total the full subscription charge for your selected Services or downgrade your subscription into shorter
          Terms.

        <li>
          <strong>Payments.</strong> You agree to pay Total Security Group, during the Initial Term or each month, as
          applicable, depending on your choice of service plan, all fees for the Services, as set forth on the pricing
          page at the time you purchase the Services. You acknowledge, agree, and authorize Total Security Group to

          or Renewal Term (as applicable), unless and until you cancel the Services before the end of the Initial Term
          or any Renewal Term. All charges will be taken on the date of renewal; for example, for monthly subscription
          plans, your payment method will be charged at the end of your monthly cycle for these Services. If the payment
          method on file with Total Security Group has expired or does not permit automatic renewals, you must contact
          Total Security Group to renew the Services. If you do not renew your Services upon its renewal date, your

          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Our remote access agents (“RAAs”) will be in a position to access and view your private and

            </li>
            <li>
              RAAs will be able to delete and edit data on your licensed device and any attached media storage
              capacity (attached at the time of remote access by the RAAs).
            </li>
            <li>
              Under certain circumstances, action(s) taken by the RAA in connection with providing RAS may lead to
              the loss or corruption of data on your device or which may result in loss of functionality in a device.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to provide RAS, the RAA may need to upload or download information from your device in order
              to provide necessary technical support such as downloading log files or related utilities.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Customer Responsibilities in Connection with Seeking or Utilizing RAS.</strong></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              You are solely responsible for maintaining and backing up all information, data, text, files, photos or
              other materials (e.g. software) that are on your device and storage media before ordering RAS, installing
              any recommended or required files, as well as at the time when you request and receive any RAS and
              providing access to an RAA.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should ensure that any confidential or personal files are closed before the RAS session commences,
              and are appropriately labelled as being private or confidential.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should ensure that you have the necessary or proper capacity and authority to bind yourself to the

              have full authority and responsibility for your device and storage media in connection with the provision
              and receipt of any and all RAS provided by the RAA.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should be actively present at all times during the RAS provided by the RAA in order to follow any
              instructions or implement any recommendations from the RAA (e.g. entering passwords for access, providing

              You understand and agree that by requesting any RAS, an RAA may download and use software on your
              device; gather system data from your device; take remote access control of your device (upon your
              consent); and otherwise access and modify the device settings as reasonably to troubleshoot any issues and
              provide the necessary RAS identified.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand and agree that by using our RAS, an RAA may (while engaging in or undertaking the
              necessary or required RAS) be exposed to or be able to view private and confidential files, information
              and/or material on your device if not otherwise properly closed or secured.

              We do not take any responsibility for any data (including any files or software) that could be on your
              device or storage media while the RAS are performed. We cannot be held responsible for any loss or
              corruption of any data (including any files or software), whether as a result of negligence, accident or
              otherwise. If reasonably necessary in order to perform the RAS, some or all files or software may be
              deleted in order to remove viruses, malware, infections, trojan horses, automated programs, worms or
              corrupted data/files/software in order to make the device functional again.
