        <p>The GDPR applies to all EU organizations that handle personal data.  The GDPR also applies to organizations outside the EU that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU.  This represents a territorial expansion of the pre-GDPR regime.</p>
        <div class="data-policy privacy_new">
          <h4>What Data is Covered by the GDPR?</h4>
          <p>The GDPR applies to personal data and special categories of personal data, i.e., sensitive personal data.  The GDPR's definition of personal data is more detailed and expansive than in the pre-GDPR regime, e.g.:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A wide range of personal identifiers (such as IP address) can constitute personal data;</li>
            <li>The GDPR applies to automated personal data and manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria—this could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records;</li>
            <li>Personal data that has been pseudonymized (e.g., key-coded) can fall within the scope of the GDPR.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wholly or partly by automated means (e.g., personal data held in electronic form on a computer or other such device) –or–</li>
            <li>Other than by automated means, where that personal data forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a filing system (e.g., this could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wholly or partly by automated means (e.g., personal data held in electronic form on a computer or other such device) –or–</li>
            <li>Other than by automated means, where that personal data forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a filing system (e.g., this could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, despite its potentially wide material scope, the GDPR does not apply to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anonymous data.  This includes data “which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person” or “personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.”</li>
            <li>Data relating to deceased persons.  Member States are permitted to provide their own rules relating to the processing of personal data of deceased individuals.</li>
            <li>Data relating to legal persons.  This includes the name, form, and contact details of a company or another legal entity, which might have a legal personality separate to its owners or directors, does not constitute personal data and does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.</li>
            <li>Personal data contained within files or sets of files which are not structured according to specific criteria (e.g., manual/physical files which do not, and are not intended to, form part of a filing system). </li>
            <li>The processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law.  This includes activities involving national security, or immigration issues relating to third-country nationals on humanitarian grounds.</li>
            <li>The processing of personal data by Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the EU.</li>
            <li>The processing of personal data by an individual for purely personal or household activities with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. </li>
            <li>The processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.</li>
            <li>The processing of personal data by EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.</li>

          <h4>Transferring Your Personal Information Out of the EEA</h4>
          <p>To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With our offices outside the EEA;</li>
            <li>With your and our service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
            <li>If you are based outside the EEA;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK data protection law.</p>
          <p>If you would like further information, please contact us (see ‘How to contact us' below).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="data-policy privacy_new">
          <h4>Rights of the Data Subject</h4>
          <p>As noted above, the GDPR provides for new and extended data subject rights.  These are set out in Chapter 3 of the GDPR, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, GDPR and they include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>right to be informed</b> (Articles 13 and 14); </li>
            <li>The <b>right of access</b> (Article 15) is the right to be provided with a copy of your personal information;</li>
            <li>The <b>right of rectification</b> (Article 16) is the right to require us to correct any mistakes in your personal information;</li>
            <li>The <b>right to erasure</b>, also known as the "right to be forgotten" (Article 17) is the right to require us to delete your personal information—in certain situations;</li>
            <li>The <b>right to restrict processing</b> (Article 18) is the right to require us to restrict processing of your personal information—in certain circumstances, e.g. if you contest the accuracy of the data;</li>
            <li>The <b>right to data portability</b> (Article 20) is the right to receive the personal information you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or transmit that data to a third party—in certain situations;</li>
            <li>The <b>right to object</b> (Article 21) —at any time to your personal information being processed for direct marketing (including profiling)—in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information, e.g. processing carried out for the purpose of our legitimate interests;</li>
            <li>The <b>right to not to be subject to automated individual decision-making</b> (Article 22) is the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these rights are underpinned by Article 12 of the GDPR, which sets out general rules on transparency which are applicable to, among other things, the provision of information to data subjects and communications with data subjects concerning the exercise of their rights.</p>
          <p>For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on individuals’ rights under the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
          <p>If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Email—see below: “How to contact us” –and–</li>
            <li>Let us have enough information to identify you (e.g., your full name, address and customer or matter reference number);</li>
            <li>Let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your driving license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill);</li>
            <li>Let us know what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates.</li>
          </ul>
