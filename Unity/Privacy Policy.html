General Terms and Conditions</strong></p><p><strong>4.1 Control/Application of the DPA</strong>. In the event of any conflict or discrepancy between the SCCs, the Additional Terms for Other-Applicable Data Protection Law, the Terms of Service, and the terms and conditions of this DPA, the following order of precedence will apply: (a) the SCCs (where applicable), (b) this DPA, (c) the Additional Terms for Non-Applicable Data Protection Law, (d) the Terms of Service. This DPA applies only to Customer, and Unity and does not confer any rights to any third party hereunder. This DPA does not replace any additional rights related to privacy or data security set forth in the Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>4.2 Treatment of Data Rights and Restrictions in Other Agreements. </strong>Customer agrees that this DPA does not enlarge any rights provided for in the Terms of Service, and Customer continues to be limited to the data use rights and restrictions provided for therein.</p><p><strong>4.3 Limitations of Liability. </strong>This DPA in no way alters the limitations of liability or other legal terms set out in the Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>4.4 Advertiser’s Mobile Measurement Partners.</strong> Where Customer is an Advertiser, it agrees that, to the extent it requires Unity to present data to a third party install tracker in connection with trafficking of its advertising campaigns, that it has such third parties under a valid data processing agreement clearly directing the install tracker as to its usage instructions, duties, and liabilities for processing such data.</p><p><strong>4.5 Special Category Data.</strong> With the exception of information uploaded through the use of Ziva Face Trainer, Unity MARS, Unity AR Companion App, and Safe Voice, which may be considered as biometric under applicable laws, Special Category Data will not be processed pursuant to this DPA and the Customer warrants and represents that the Customer will not be sharing, disclosing or otherwise transferring such data to Unity.</p><p>4.5.1 You represent and warrant that you have complied with all Data Protection Laws with respect to any transfer of Person Data to us in connection with your use of the Service. Such compliance by you includes, but is not limited to, you providing proper notification of the transfer, communicating the possibility that a person’s data may be transmitted outside their country of origin, and obtaining any necessary consents for both collection and storage of biometric information of such person, including any geometric scans of that individual’s facial features. Further, where applicable, you give your written consent to Unity to collect, store, disclose and use any biometric information contained in Your Materials from which Created Materials will be provided as part of the Service. Please note that Unity may request copies of your consent records to confirm your compliance with this Section 4.5.1. Failure to provide proper documentation may result in cancellation of your use of the Service.</p><p><strong>4.5.2 Biometric Laws</strong> This Section applies to all transfers and disclosures of Personal Data from Customer to Unity as contemplated by the Terms of Service, particularly where such data consists of an individual voiceprint or any geometric scans of the facial features of an individual (“<strong>Biometric Information</strong>”) and is within the scope of applicable Biometric Laws including but not limited to BIPA and CUBI. Terms not otherwise defined in this DPA shall have the meaning ascribed to it by Applicable Data Protection Law </p><p>4.5.2.1 Customer must comply with Biometric Laws, including but not limited to, providing proper notification of the transfer, communicating the possibility that an individual’s data will be transmitted outside their country of origin, and obtaining any necessary consents for both collection and storage of biometric data.</p><p>4.5.2.2 Where Biometric Information is used by Customer and transmitted to Unity in connection with the Services, Customer will obtain advance, adequate consents from those persons whose Biometric Information has been used. Such consent will be in compliance with applicable Biometric Laws and Applicable Data Protection Law.</p><p>4.5.2.3 Unity shall secure Biometric Information in the same manner as any other confidential or sensitive information that it stores. The information shall be destroyed upon conclusion of its use as specified elsewhere in this DPA.</p><p><strong>4.6 Compliance with Law/Public Notices. </strong>Each party shall maintain a publicly-accessible privacy policy on its website that satisfies the transparency disclosure requirements of Applicable Data Protection Law. Customer shall list Unity as a third party that is collecting data within its application in its publicly available privacy policy, including by providing a link to Unity’s privacy policy. To the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Law, the Parties agree that they will specifically identify to the other Party when they require that the Party obtain from the relevant individuals their explicit consent pursuant to Applicable Data Protection Law, thereby permitting the use of his or her Personal Data by the receiving Party as contemplated by that Party. The foregoing does not create a general requirement related to Consent, and a Party requiring Consent must provide adequate notice to the other Party of this requirement. Customer agrees to keep up to date versions of Unity software and services installed in their applications as Unity identifies as necessary to permit Unity to maintain its compliance with law. By way of example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Unity relies on Customer updating its applications with software changes made to provide certain opportunities for End Users to exercise their rights to disclosure and deletion requests; however, updates unrelated to compliance with law may occur from time to time which are not subject to this Section 4.6 nor governed by this DPA.</p><p><strong>4.7 Term and Termination.</strong> This DPA will become effective as of the date Customer has accepted both: (i) a valid Terms of Service; and (ii) solely to the extent this DPA is not already incorporated into such Terms of Service, this DPA. Subject to Section 4.9, This DPA will terminate simultaneously and automatically upon the termination of the Terms of Service. Unity may terminate this DPA (in whole or in part) at any time upon notice to Customer if Unity offers alternative means to Customer that complies with Applicable Data Protection Laws. Customer may terminate this DPA at Customer’s discretion upon Unity’s receipt of Customer’s written notice of termination.</p><p><strong>4.8 Governing Law. </strong>To the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Law, this DPA will be governed by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. In all other cases, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction set forth in the Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>4.9 Survival. </strong>This DPA shall survive termination or expiry of any terms of service or other agreement to permit Unity to comply with its legal obligations. Upon termination or expiry of the Parties’ relationship, Unity may continue to process the personal data provided that such processing complies with the requirements of this Section 4.9 and otherwise with Applicable Data Protection Law.<br/></p><h4><strong>5.
