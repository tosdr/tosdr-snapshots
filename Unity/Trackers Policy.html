certain UnityAds, ironSource and Tapjoy offerings, as further detailed herein, whereas each offering is provided, operated, and billed independently and separately by the designated entity, as detailed below.<br/><br/>If you were directed to this page in connection with your use of any Game Service, Engage Service, Multiplayer Service, or Consulting Service, please note that the applicable terms are now available at the following link: https://unity.com/legal (or a different URL Unity may provide from time to time).</p><p><br/>These Terms of Service (the General Terms and, together with the Additional Terms, the “Terms”) are a binding agreement between you and Unity Technologies SF, an entity duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of California, USA (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Unity”), and govern your use or access to the Services made available to you by Unity. Certain Services may be provided by different Affiliates of Unity, with invoices issued by the applicable Affiliate. For example, ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“<strong>ironSource</strong>”) and Tapjoy, Inc. (“<strong>Tapjoy</strong>”) are two separate Affiliates of Unity’s, and each provides advertising and monetization Services independently within its own network, and the term Unity in the Terms shall apply to such Affiliate, as applicable. If you are a client of the ironSource offerings, you will receive invoice(s) issued by and payable to ironSource pursuant to the payment-related terms provided herein. Some Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions in order to use or access such Services. With regards to such Services, your agreement shall also constitute a binding agreement between you and the Unity entity.<br/><br/>The term “you” as used in these Terms means either an individual utilizing any of the Offerings in his or her individual capacity or the company or other entity affiliated with an individual utilizing any of the Offerings on behalf of that company or other entity.<br/><br/>By clicking to accept these Terms, registering for any of the Offerings or accessing, enabling or utilizing any of the Offerings or Service Assets (including access, enablement or utilization based on a “free,” “evaluation,” or “trial” basis), you represent that you have read, understand, accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not accept and agree with these Terms you are not authorized to use any of the Offerings or Service Assets.<br/><br/>If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other entity (e.g., an Agency on behalf of an advertiser), you represent that you are a duly authorized employee or agent of such company or other entity with the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of such company or other entity and that such company or other entity will be bound by these Terms. In such a case, the term “you” will also refer to such third party or parties on a joint and several basis. If you are an individual entering into these Terms on your own behalf, you represent that you are the age of legal majority or older and have the legal capacity to enter into and be bound by these Terms.<br/><br/>Unity may, from time to time, modify these Terms at its discretion.

All charges are subject to applicable restrictions and criteria set forth in an Offering Identification.</p><p>2.2. Payments from Unity. In connection with your use of the Monetization Services, you acknowledge and agree that all Net Revenue attributable to the Ads belongs to Unity, except that Unity will pay you a percentage of Net Revenue attributable to the Ads that run in your Applications each calendar month. Certain Applications might be subject to different payment terms which will be communicated to you, based on our internal analysis and discretion.</p><p>2.2.1.

Amounts payable of less than one hundred dollars ($100 USD) may be held by Unity until amounts payable exceed one hundred dollars ($100 USD) or a final payment is due hereunder. If payments made to you are not received due to the failure to provide accurate information, failure to cash a check, or otherwise, Unity has no ongoing obligation to hold such funds for you and, after a reasonable time as determined by Unity in its discretion, the funds will continue to be considered property of Unity.</p><p>2.2.3. Net Revenue and payment calculations will be based on Unity’s measurements, which will be the system of record for calculating such sums.

You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and fees of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with any of the Offerings, except for taxes based on Unity’s net income.

You agree that you have not and will not provide inaccurate, misleading, or false information to Unity.

You agree that immediately upon demand by Unity you will reimburse Unity for all losses associated with any inaccurate, misleading, or false information you provided to Unity, as determined by Unity in its sole discretion. You further agree that in connection with the above, Unity will have the right to retain any funds otherwise payable to you under any Offering or other agreement between you and Unity to offset the foregoing losses.</p><p>5.6.
