The previous version of the Software Terms can be found <a href="https://unity.com/legal/provider-legacy">here</a>.</p><p></p><h2>1. Background</h2><h3>1.1</h3><p>The Unity Asset Store is a publicly available site on which Providers can effect the distribution of Assets licensed by them to Customers.</p><h3>1.2</h3><p>This Agreement regulates the legal relationship between Provider as a content creator and Unity as the operator of the Unity Asset Store.</p><h3>1.3</h3><p>The purpose of the Agreement is to establish the legal framework for the Provider’s distribution of their Assets via Unity&#x27;s online and in-editor asset store service.</p><h2>2. Definitions &amp; Interpretation</h2><h3>2.1</h3><p>For the purposes of this Agreement with pertaining appendices, the below terms shall have the following meanings unless otherwise stated or clear from the context:</p><p><strong>&quot;Agreement&quot;</strong></p><p>This Asset Store Provider Agreement.</p><p><strong>&quot;Assets&quot;</strong></p><p>Any (a) software designed in order to facilitate the development of electronic games and digital media; and (b) content (for example – without limitation – computer graphics, including 3D computer graphics, sounds and music), tutorials and other digital materials created in order to become incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and digital media, in accordance with the Unity Asset Store Guidelines in force at any time, and distributed via the Unity Asset Store. Tutorials, demonstration videos, and related marketing material submitted to Unity by Provider, whether directly or via hyperlink, are considered part of the &quot;Asset&quot; to which they relate.</p><p><strong>&quot;Brand Features&quot;</strong></p><p>Any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo, domain name, and other distinctive brand feature of each Party, respectively, as owned (or licensed) by such Party from time to time.</p><p><strong>“Campaign”</strong></p><p>Any campaign or promotion via the Unity Asset Store through which licenses for Assets are offered at discounted prices or for free (with respect to Assets for which a fee is normally charged) that is no longer than 31 consecutive days.</p><p><strong>&quot;Customer&quot;</strong></p><p>Any person, company or other legal entity that will acquire licenses to Assets via the Unity Asset Store.</p><p><strong>“Dashboard”</strong></p><p>The online dashboard made available to Providers at the Unity Asset Store.</p><p><strong>“EULA”</strong></p><p>The Asset Store End User License Agreement—i.e., Appendix 1 of the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/as_terms">Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA</a>.</p><p><strong>“Floor Price”</strong></p><p>The minimum price that may be set for a license to a Provider Asset, as indicated by Unity at the Dashboard.</p><p><strong>&quot;Provider&quot;</strong></p><p>Any person, company or other legal entity who has accepted this Agreement by clicking and who is registered and approved by the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>&quot;Party&quot; or &quot;Parties&quot;</strong></p><p>Unity and/or Provider.</p><p><strong>&quot;Payment Processor(s)&quot;</strong></p><p>Any party authorized by Unity to provide payment processing services for payments from Customers to Unity or payments made from Unity to Providers for Assets distributed via the Unity Asset Store.</p><p><strong>“Promotion Discounting”</strong></p><p>Except where the Provider has opted out at the Dashboard for an Asset at least 31 consecutive days prior to the start of a Campaign involving that Asset, the Unity Asset Store may cause Provider discounting of the price for the license to that Asset by the lesser of (a) a percentage less than %100; and (b) that maximum percentage set by Provider at the Dashboard for that Asset at least 31 consecutive days prior to the start of that Campaign. Discounting for Campaigns that (i) are available to all END-USERS without any eligibility criteria; and (ii) do not offer more than 1 license for 1 Asset at a single price, may only occur at most 2 times per any 12 consecutive month period and no longer than 14 consecutive days each time. The price for affected licenses to Assets may not be changed by Provider at any time during a Campaign or, as indicated by the Unity Asset Store at the Dashboard in its discretion, for 31 consecutive days prior to and/or following the Campaign.</p><p><strong>“Program Fund(s)”</strong></p><p>Optional, non-refundable contribution by Customer to Provider in connection with the Program.</p><p><strong>“Support The Creator Program”</strong> or the <strong>“Program”</strong><br/>Program that Unity may initiate, in its discretion, to let Customers contribute Program Funds directly to Providers, in addition to any applicable license fee. Providers of free and paid Assets will be automatically enrolled in the Program, but will only receive Program Funds if they have provided Unity with a valid Payment Processor account for payment.</p><p><strong>“Taxes”</strong></p><p>Any withholding (on income) taxes, sales taxes, VAT, government levies, or the like applicable to license fees or Program Funds.</p><p>&quot;<strong>Unity</strong>&quot;</p><p>Unity Technologies SF, (C3183233) 30 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States</p><p><strong>&quot;Unity Asset Store&quot;</strong></p><p>The Unity Asset Store site operated by Unity.</p><h3>2.2</h3><p>Consistent with the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/as_terms">EULA</a>, Assets are licensed and not sold. In this Agreement, any references to prices for Assets or the sale/acquisition of Assets are for purposes of convenience only; in all cases this means prices for licenses to Assets or the sale/acquisition of those licenses.</p><h2>3. Accepting this Agreement</h2><h3>3.1</h3><p>This Agreement forms a legally binding contract between Provider and Unity, in relation to Provider&#x27;s use of the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets. In order to use the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets, Provider must first agree to this Agreement by checking the box indicating Provider’s acceptance of this Agreement prior to distributing Assets on the Unity Asset Store. Provider may not distribute Assets on the Unity Asset Store if Provider does not accept this Agreement.</p><h3>3.2</h3><p>Any person who enters into this Agreement on behalf of Provider represents and warrants that they have full legal authority to bind Provider.</p><h3>3.3</h3><p>Provider expressly accepts and agrees that Unity shall be entitled to forward Provider&#x27;s name, address and other contact details to any third Party that reasonably claims that Provider does not have all necessary intellectual property rights, including all necessary patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights, in and to Provider&#x27;s Assets. Provider also agrees that the handling of personal data in relationship to the distribution of its assets on the Unity Asset Store is governed by the Controller-Controller Asset Store Addendum found <a href="https://unity.com/legal/Controller_DPA_Asset_Store">here</a>.</p><p></p><h2>4. Pricing and Payments</h2><h3>4.1</h3><p>This Agreement covers both licenses for Assets that Provider chooses to distribute for free and for which Provider charges a fee. All fees for licenses for Assets distributed via the Unity Asset Store must be processed by the Payment Processor.</p><h3>4.2</h3><p>Provider may set the price for licenses to Provider&#x27;s Assets in US Dollars (USD), so long as the price is not lower than the Floor Price, and subject to Promotion Discounting. The Unity Asset Store may display to Customers the price of Provider&#x27;s Assets in USD or other currencies that Unity may consider expedient. Unity may choose to set different prices in other currencies, and shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the prices set, or for currency and conversion rates.</p><h3>4.3</h3><p>The prices set under Section 4.2 will determine the amount of payment that Provider will receive. 70 (seventy) percent of the sales price (less any refunds, bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider and less any Taxes) will be remitted by Unity to the Provider; the remaining 30 (thirty) percent will be allotted to and retained by Unity. Without limitation of the foregoing, where a refund is provided by Unity on Provider’s behalf under this Agreement, Unity may deduct and withhold Provider portion of such refund amount from any current Provider balance. Licenses to Provider Assets may be offered via the Unity Asset Store with licenses to other (non-Provider) Assets; in such event, Provider will receive its payment pro rata. The foregoing percentages shall not apply to applicable Program Funds, 100 (one hundred) percent of which shall be remitted to Provider, less any applicable bank fees or Taxes related to the transfer to Provider.</p><p><strong>4.3.1 </strong>PayPal Accounts Paid Monthly. The parties agree that any balance in favor of Provider will be calculated by Unity and made available to Provider via a web page. Unity will use reasonable efforts to pay Provider the applicable balance on a monthly basis as long as Provider provides and maintains a valid PayPal account.</p><p><strong>4.3.2 </strong>Check or Wire Payments Paid Quarterly. If Provider fails to provide a valid PayPal account, Unity will pay balances above USD 250 to Provider on a quarterly basis by check or wire payment, less applicable bank fees. However, any such account balance of less than 250 USD in favor in of Providerat the end of a calendar quarter will not be paid. Instead, such balance below 250 USD will be carried forward to the following calendar quarter. In the event that the balance for a period of eight consecutive calendar quarters remains below 250 USD, then Unity will pay such balance to Provider, less any bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider. The current applicable bank fees for check or wire payments are set forth in the Asset Store.</p><p><strong>4.3.3 </strong>Notwithstanding anything else herein, if Provider is an individual and resident in Denmark, provision to Unity of Provider&#x27;s tax identification number registered with the Danish Central Business Register (&quot;CVR Number&quot;) shall be a condition precedent to any payment obligation of Unity&#x27;s under this Agreement; for greater certainty, (a) unless and until Unity is provided with the Provider&#x27;s CVR Number, Unity is under no obligation to make any payment to the Provider; and (b) upon being provided with the CVR Number, accrued amounts will become payable hereunder, but no interest will be payable on those amounts.</p><h3>4.4</h3><p><strong>4.4.1 </strong>Provider is solely responsible for (a) collection and payment of any Taxes on transactions for purchases of licenses for Assets from Provider, including Program Funds; and (b) Taxes on any payments it receives from Unity (or directly from Customers via Program Funds) regardless of which taxing jurisdiction that has jurisdiction concerning such Taxes. For greater certainty, except as otherwise expressly provided by Unity to the contrary, all payments from Unity to Provider are inclusive of Taxes (other than withholding Taxes), and where applicable law requires Unity to withhold any amounts otherwise due to Provider, Unity may withhold such amounts unless Provider tenders to Unity adequate tax documentation supporting lesser withholding Taxes (amounts payable to Provider will not be grossed up on account of withholding Taxes).</p><p><strong>4.4.2</strong> Provider will provide Unity with any and all information and documentation as Unity deems necessary for Unity to account for performance of Provider’s obligations under Section 4.4 and Unity’s own taxation obligations. Without limitation of any other remedies under this Agreement or at law, any Provider failure to provide such information or documentation will be grounds for Unity to suspend payment to Provider under this Agreement indefinitely until provision of such information or documentation. No suspended payment shall accrue or be entitled to any interest of any kind.</p><p><strong>4.4.3 </strong>Provider agrees that Unity may, at its option and in its sole discretion, provide means for collection and/or payment under sub-paragraph (a) of Section 4.4.1, in whole or in part, on behalf of Provider. For greater certainty, however, Provider agrees that Unity shall not have or accept any liability for taking any such action; further Unity taking any such action shall not relieve Provider of its obligations under Section 4.4, and Provider shall at all times be liable for performance of such obligations.</p><p>4.4.4 If a Customer chooses to contribute Program Funds but Provider has not provided Unity with sufficient Payment Processor information to process Program Funds, Unity may contribute the Program Funds to a charitable organization of its choice. (For clarity, the terms “donation,” “charitable organization,” and “contribution” are informational only and not intended as tax or legal advice. Program Funds are taxable and Provider will not be entitled to any tax deduction in connection with the Program.)</p><h3>4.5</h3><p>Provider may also choose to distribute Assets for free. If the Asset is free, Unity shall not be entitled to receive the 30 (thirty) per cent listed in Section 4.3 above. Provider may not in the future collect charges from Customers for copies of the Assets that those Customers previously downloaded for free. Providers distributing Assets for free are still entitled to join any Support the Creator-Program by setting up a Payment Processor account as set forth in this Section 4.</p><h3>4.6</h3><p>Refund Requirements</p><p><strong>4.6.1 </strong>In addition and without prejudice to the Payment Processor&#x27;s standard terms and conditions regarding refunds, the following terms apply to Provider&#x27;s distribution of Assets on the Unity Asset Store:</p><p><strong>4.6.2</strong> Provider authorizes Unity to give the Customer a full refund of the price for a license to any Asset on Provider’s behalf if the Customer requests the refund within 2weeks after purchase, and Provider has not provided any refund directly to the Customer, in any of the following circumstances:</p><p>(i) the Asset was not as advertised (including any demo made available);</p><p>(ii) the Asset is not compatible with the most recent official release of Unity and no information was provided at the Unity Asset Store to indicate that Asset is so incompatible; or</p><p>(iii) the Asset includes unauthorized intellectual property.</p><p><strong>4.6.3 </strong>In the event that a Customer returns any Asset and/or receives a refund, all license rights granted herein terminate and under the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/as_terms">EULA</a> and the Customer will be instructed to immediately destroy any and all copies contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the Customer.</p><h3>4.7</h3><p>Provider Support</p><p><strong>4.7.1 </strong>Provider will be solely responsible for support and maintenance of Provider&#x27;s Assets and any complaints about Provider&#x27;s Assets. Provider&#x27;s contact information will be displayed in each Asset detail page and made available to Customers for customer support purposes.</p><p><strong>4.7.2</strong> Failure to provide adequate support for Provider&#x27;s Assets may result in low Asset ratings, less prominent Asset exposure, low sales and billing disputes. In the event of disputes for Assets sold for less than 50 USD, Unity may at Provider&#x27;s expense decide that the full purchase price shall be refunded to the Customer and charged back in full to the Provider, in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor. Chargeback requests for Assets sold at 50 USD or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor&#x27;s standard policy.</p><h3>4.8</h3><p>Reinstalls</p><p>Provider acknowledges and agrees that Customers that have licensed an Asset will have the ability to access and download the Asset for as long as the Asset is available on the Asset Store. Customer’s use of the Asset shall remain subject to the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/as_terms">EULA</a>.</p><h3>4.9</h3><p>Donations</p><p><strong>4.9.1</strong> Providers of free Assets may request and accept indirect donations for their work, provided that the following conditions are complied with:</p><p><strong>4.9.1.1 </strong>Donations shall be handled via the Provider’s own payment transaction system on their own website.</p><p><strong>4.9.1.2 </strong>Provider&#x27;s free Assets may not have a special enhanced version of this Asset which Provider markets outside of the Unity Asset Store (and thus circumventing the payment in favor of Unity, as specified in 4.3 above.</p><p><strong>4.9.1.3</strong> Assets themselves may not explicitly mention, prompt or request donations when embedded in a built Unity project (executable, browser game, etc.) nor in the editor if it uses editor classes.</p><p><strong>4.9.1.4 </strong>Donation requests shall be mentioned by use of the text: “donations accepted” on the Asset’s Asset Store page/description itself.</p><h2>5. Use of the Unity Asset Store by Provider</h2><h3>5.1</h3><p>Except for the license rights granted by Provider in Section 6 below, Unity agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from Provider (or Provider&#x27;s licensors) under this Agreement in or to any Asset supplied by Provider, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in those Assets.</p><h3>5.2</h3><p>Provider agrees to use the Unity Asset Store only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from Denmark or other relevant countries).</p><h3>5.3</h3><p>Provider agrees that Provider will protect the privacy and legal rights of Customers. If the Customers provide Provider with, or Provider&#x27;s Assets access or use, Customer names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, Provider must make the Customers aware that the information will be available to Provider, and Provider must provide a legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those Customers. Further, Provider may only use that information for the limited purposes for which the Customer has given Provider permission to do so. If Provider&#x27;s Assets store personal or sensitive information provided by Customers, it must do so securely and only for as long as it is needed and in full compliance with any applicable law regarding Provider&#x27;s access or use of such information. But if the Customer has opted into a separate agreement with Provider that allows Provider or Provider&#x27;s Asset to store or use personal or sensitive information directly related to Provider&#x27;s Asset then the terms of that separate agreement and any applicable privacy laws will govern Provider&#x27;s use of such information.</p><h3>5.4</h3><p>Prohibited Actions</p><p>Provider agrees that Provider will not engage in any activity with the Unity Asset Store, including the development or distribution of Assets, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices, servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to Customers, Unity, payment providers or any network operator.</p><p><strong>5.4.1</strong> Provider may not use customer information that Provider has obtained from the Unity Asset Store or Customers acquired via the Asset Store to sell or distribute Assets outside of the Unity Asset Store.</p><h3>5.5</h3><p>Non-Compete</p><p><strong>5.5.1 </strong>Provider may not use the Unity Asset Store to distribute or make available any Asset whose primary purpose is to facilitate the distribution of Assets outside of the Unity Asset Store.</p><h3>5.6</h3><p>Provider agrees that Provider is solely responsible for (and that Unity has no responsibility to Provider or to any third party for) any Assets Provider distributes through the Unity Asset Store and for the consequences of Provider&#x27;s actions (including any loss or damage which Unity may suffer) by doing so.</p><h3>5.7</h3><p>Provider agrees that Provider is solely responsible for (and that Unity has no responsibility to Provider or to any third party for) any breach of Provider&#x27;s obligations under this Agreement, any applicable third party contract or terms of service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Unity or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.</p><h3>5.8</h3><p>Asset Ratings</p><p><strong>5.8.1</strong> The Unity Asset Store will allow Customers to rate Assets. Only Customers who download the applicable Asset will be able to rate it. Asset ratings will be used to determine the placement of Assets on the Unity Asset Store with higher rated Assets generally given better placement, subject to Unity&#x27;s ability to change placement at Unity&#x27;s sole discretion. Unity reserves the right to display Assets to Customers in a manner that will be determined at Unity&#x27;s sole discretion.</p><p><strong>5.8.2</strong> Provider&#x27;s Assets may be subject to ratings to which Provider may not agree. In addition other factors that Unity deems relevant such as (but not limited to) community ratings and Provider&#x27;s history may influence such ratings. Provider may contact Unity if Provider has any questions or concerns regarding such ratings.</p><h3>5.9</h3><p>Marketing Provider&#x27;s Assets</p><p><strong>5.9.1</strong> Provider will be responsible for uploading Provider&#x27;s Assets to the Unity Asset Store, providing required Asset information to Customers, and accurately disclosing the security permissions necessary for the Asset to function on Customer&#x27;s equipment.
