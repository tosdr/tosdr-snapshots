              Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (<b>DNT</b>) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have their online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service operators, including Windcave, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.

              New standards are being developed for a Universal Opt-Out Mechanism, such as the Global Privacy Control (<b>GPC</b>), which allow users with GPC-enabled browsers and devices to send a signal that will communicate the user’s request to opt-out of sales of their personal information and to opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information. The CPRA and other laws allow for the acceptance of Opt-Out Preference Signals such as the GPC, as an option for users to transmit an Opt-Out of selling/sharing personal information. If we detect and recognize such a signal from your device or browser, we will honor it.

                  <b>Right to access your personal data:</b> You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. However, you should be aware that where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request, we will always tell you the reasons for doing so. To exercise this right, contact us via e-mail <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#187b777568747179767b7d586f71767c7b796e7d367b7775"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8fece0e2ffe3e6eee1eceacff8e6e1ebeceef9eaa1ece0e2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and we will send you a letter with information (or will explain in person) how you can obtain a copy of your personal data.

We will stop such processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests or if the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You can limit the processing of personal data in at least one of the following circumstances:

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Windcave no longer needs your personal data for the specified purposes, but you need the data to assert, fulfil or defend legal claims;

                      your personal data is processed based on legitimate interest, and you object to such processing of personal data. In this case, data processing will be limited until it is checked whether the reasons for which we process your personal data are superior to you.

We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so. When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data. You have the right to request that we no longer process your personal data (and delete it in some cases) in the event of at least one of the following circumstances:

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      you revoke the consent on which the data processing was based, and there is no other legal basis for processing the data;
