                  11.1. You can purchase digital credits, also known as "credits or
                  tokens", to use the Services available on the Website. Such digital
                  credits lose their validity 3 months after the date of purchase. When
                  spending credits, the credits purchased earliest are automatically used
                  before credits purchased more recently.

                  on the checkout page and will include VAT or any other applicable sales
                  tax. We accept payment via a third party payment service provider (who
                  will vary depending on the country where you make the payment). As part
                  of the checkout process, you will automatically be re-directed to their

                  terminate your account and block your access to the Website and the
