THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE  LAWS OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. </p><p id class="my-3 text-lg max-w-7xl">a. <em>Arbitration</em>. Subject to Section 10(f<em>), </em>any dispute arising out of these Terms, the <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, or  the Services will be resolved exclusively on an individual basis by binding and confidential arbitration conducted in the English language, in New York, New York, before a single commercial  arbitrator from JAMS, Inc.

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related  to these Terms, including their formation and any claim that some or all of it is void or  unenforceable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Dashlane. The  arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other  proceedings or parties. The arbitrator may (i) grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim  or dispute, (ii) award monetary damages and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available  to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms (including  the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement describing  the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is  based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will follow the applicable  law. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties. Each party will bear its  own costs of arbitration.  </p><p id class="my-3 text-lg max-w-7xl">c. <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO  SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN AS NOTED IN SECTION 10(F) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A  JUDGE OR A JURY.
