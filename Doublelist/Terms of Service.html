If anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to DL.

</p>
<p>If you submit UGC that DL reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by applicable law. We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.

Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Los Angeles, California for any and all purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Pre-Arbitration Notification</h5>
<p>DL and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that DL need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (“IP Disputes,” with all other disputes referred to as “General Disputes”). The party making a claim – whether you or DL – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If DL is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your DL account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under Section. If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 2261 Market Street #4626, San Francisco, CA 94114; Attn: Legal Department). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 8. Either you or DL, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to the <u>Limitation on Injunctive Relief</u> before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Arbitration of Claims</h5>
<p>Unless you give us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: 2261 Market Street #4626, San Francisco, CA 94114; Attn: Legal Department, all actions or proceedings arising from, in connection with, regarding, or relating to any Dispute, or the scope of the provisions of this Section, shall be submitted to JAMS www.jamsadr.com for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in Los Angeles County, California, before a single arbitrator in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1280 et seq. If the matter in dispute is between DL and a consumer, the matter shall be submitted to JAMS in accordance with its Policy on Consumer Arbitration Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS. We may have the right to pay the JAMS fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. If you are a consumer you have the right to an in-person hearing. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The parties may engage in the discovery or exchange of non- privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California or, if sought by DL, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the JAMS does not require you to register your agreement. The prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5> Limitation on Injunctive Relief</h5>
<p>AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.

<h5>Governing Law</h5>
<p>These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, General Disputes and IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against DL or by DL against you pursuant to this Section 9, or otherwise related to the Service, Content, DL Licensed Elements, UGC or other DL products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. This Section 9 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and DL agree that we intend that this Section 9 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 9 can only be amended by mutual agreement. Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 9 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>As permitted by applicable law, both you and DL waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 8 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Jury Waiver</h5>
<p>AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.</p>
