<h3 id="personal-information">1. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</h3><br>
<h5 id="personal-information-a" style="padding-left:25px;">a. Information About You That You Provide.</h5>
<p>DL and/or its Service Providers (defined below) may collect information you provide directly to DL and/or its Service Providers via the Service. For example, DL collects information when you set up an account and thereafter when you use the Service, subscribe to notifications, or communicate or transact through the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices, click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-third-party-content">here</a>. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices click <a id="goto-third-party" href="javascript:void(0)">here</a>.
</p></br>
<p>Information DL, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect may include: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, address, and full payment account number <b>(“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”)</b>; and (2) demographic information, such as your gender, age, zip code, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases <p>(“Demographic Information”)</p>. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Demographic Information is <p>“non-Personally Identifiable Information”</p> or <p>“non-PII”</p> (i.e., data that is not Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Policy). In addition, Personally Identifiable Information, including, without limitation, DL-Collected PII (defined below), once <b>“De-identified”</b> (i.e., the removal or modification of the personally identifiable elements, or the extraction of non-personally identifiable elements, including through anonymization, pseudonymization, and/or hashing) is also non-Personally Identifiable Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. However, we do not make assurances that De-identified data is not capable of re-identification. To the extent any non-Personally Identifiable Information, or PII collected outside of the Service, is combined by or on behalf of DL with Personally Identifiable Information DL itself collects directly from you on the Service (“DL-Collected PII”), DL will treat the combined data as DL-collected PII under this Privacy Policy. The definition of “personal information” under certain state laws differs from the definition of PII used in this Privacy Policy. California and Nevada residents can learn more about their privacy rights <a style="margin-left:15px; color:blue;" href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-state-privacy-rights2">here</a>.
</p>
<h5 id="personal-information-b" style="padding-left:25px;">b. Information Collected Automatically.</h5>
<p>DL, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service <b>(“Usage Information”)</b>. Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device). Except to the extent required by applicable law, or to the extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of DL with DL-Collected PII, DL does not consider Usage Information (including, without limitation, unique device identifiers) to be Personally Identifiable Information or DL-Collected PII. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices click <a id="goto-third-party-content-2" href="javascript:void(0)">here</a>. For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-third-party-2">here</a>. For information on choices some of these third parties may offer you regarding automated data collection click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-tracking-options-2">here</a>.</p></br>
<p>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p>
<ul><li><b>Log Information:</b>Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</b><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-cookies">Cookies</a>,<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-beacons"> web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”)</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-embedded">embedded scripts</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-location">location-identifying technologies</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-device">device recognition technologies</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-in-app">in-app tracking methods</a>,<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="goto-device-and-activity"> device and activity monitoring</a> and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.</li></ul>
<div class="border border-dark">
<p><b>Note the Links Above Should be Enabled and Should Go to the Following:</b></p>
<ul><li id="cookies"><b>Cookies:</b> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Service and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features, and functionalities of the Service may not work.</li></ul>
<ul><li id="beacons"><b>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”):</b> Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.</li></ul>
<ul><li id="embedded"><b>Embedded Scripts:</b> An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from DL’s web server, or from a third party with which DL works and is active only while you are connected to the Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li></ul>
<ul><li id="location"><b>Location-Identifying Technologies:</b> GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location-aware technologies locate you (sometimes precisely), or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content, including third party ads, based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Service, your device location may be tracked by us and third parties.</li></ul>
<ul><li id="device"><b>Device Recognition Technologies:</b> Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household) <b>(“Cross-Device Data”)</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li id="in-app"><b>In-App Tracking Methods:</b> There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs,” or may use “SDKs,” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.

Please see also any the general privacy policy or notice posted or referenced on our websites, apps, products, or services.</p></br>
<p>Consistent with the CCPA, Section (1) of this Notice covers our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of California Consumers’ “Personal Information” <b>(“PI”)</b> as defined by the CCPA, except to the extent such PI is exempt from the notice obligations of the CCPA for the twelve months preceding the Effective Date and will be updated annually. Our current privacy notices at the point of collection, as well as our general privacy policies and other privacy notices may reflect practices that are more current.

<p>The chart above reflects that categories of PI required by the CCPA. There may be additional information that we collect that meets the CCPA’s definition of PI but is not reflected by a category, in which case we will treat it as PI as required by the CCPA, but will not include it when we are required to describe our practices by category of PI.</p></br>
<p>As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified data or aggregate consumer information, and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI. We have no obligation to re-identify information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests.

</br>
<p>Subject to restrictions and obligations of the CCPA, our vendors may also use your PI for some or all of the above listed business purposes.

<p>For more information on your do not sell rights, see the Do Not Sell subsection below.</p>
<h5 id="california-consumer-rights" style="padding-left:35px">(2)California Consumer Privacy Rights.</h5>
<p>We provide California Consumers the privacy rights described in this section. You have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. As permitted by the CCPA, any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process <b>(“Verifiable Consumer Request”)</b> as more fully explained in the Right to Know and Right to Delete sections below. We will not fulfill your Right to Know or Right to Delete request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. To make a request, email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f1f1d06190e0c162f0b001a0d030a03061c1b410c0002"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3343415a4552504a73575c46515f565f5a40471d505c5e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <a href>here</a> and respond to any follow up inquires we may make.</p></br>
<p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPA’s verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA we do not include that PI in response to those requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p></br>
<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.</p></br>
<p>Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you financial account number, or an account password in response to a CCPA request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.</p></br>
<p>Your California Consumer privacy rights are as follows:</p>
<h5 id="rights-to-know" style="padding-left:45px">(a) Right to Know.</h5>
<p>To make a Right to Know (Categories) or Right to Know (Specific Pieces) request, email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3343415a4552504a73575c46515f565f5a40471d505c5e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b2c2c0dbc4d3d1cbf2d6ddc7d0ded7dedbc1c69cd1dddf">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here and respond to any follow up inquiries we make. We will respond to your request as outlined in the <a href>How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA </a> section below. Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.</p>
<h5 id="categories" style="padding-left: 55px;"><b>(i) Categories</b></h5>
<p>You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.
</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>
<li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred.</li>
<li>A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale occurred.</li>
</ul></br>
<p>For Categories of Information requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the verification standards set forth in the <a href>How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA</a> section below. </p></br>
<h5 id="specific" style="padding-left: 55px;"><b>(ii) Specific Pieces.</b></h5>
<p>You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p></br>
<p>For Specific Pieces of Information requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the heightened verification standards set forth in the <a href>How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA</a> section below.</p></br>
<h5 id="delete" style="padding-left: 35px;"><b>(b) The Right to Delete.</b>
</h5>
<p>You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. However, we may have a basis for retention under CCPA.. Our retention rights include, without limitation, to complete transactions and service you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.</p></br>
<p>For Delete requests, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the verification standards set forth in the <a href>How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA</a> section below.</p></br>
<p>To make a Right to Delete request, email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9b9bba0bfa8aab089ada6bcaba5aca5a0babde7aaa6a4"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9eeeecf7e8fffde7defaf1ebfcf2fbf2f7edeab0fdf1f3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <a href>here</a> and respond to any follow up inquiries we make.</p></br>
<p>Deletion of your personal information will not deactivate your account. As a result, we cannot delete personal information necessary to maintain the account. If you would like to deactivate your account, please follow the instructions in your account settings or email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7d0d0f140b1c1e043d1912081f111811140e09531e1210">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p></br>
<h5 id="do-not-sell" style="padding-left:35px !important">(c) Do Not Sell.</h5>
<p>
As noted in our Privacy Policy above, there may be cookies and other Tracking Technologies on our Service that may provide data, which may be treated as PI under the CCPA, to other parties that may use it for their own purposes, which in turn may provide that data to other parties for their own purposes. We do not believe that we sell PI collected by third-parties that operate their own cookies in association with our Services <b>(“Cookie Operators”)</b>. Cookie Operators collect PI that falls under the other identifiers (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs) and internet or other electronic activity information categories. However, we will treat PI collected by Cookie Operators, where not limited to acting as our service provider, as a sale and subject to a Do Not Sell opt-out request. We offer a cookie management tool that enables you to exercise your Do Not Sell opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device <a href>here</a>. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit and from each browser and on each device that you use. Since your opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will not be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. For additional information on cookies and alternative choices regarding them, including how to opt-out of certain interest-based advertising, see the Cookies and Tracking Technologies sections of our Privacy Policy above.</p></br>
<p>We do not knowingly sell the PI of Consumers under 16, as the Service is not available to anyone who is not at least 18 years of age.</p></br>
<p>We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a sale: (i) if you direct us to share PI; (ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Company as defined above, or as part of a merger or asset sale; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</p></br>
<h5 id="non-discrimination" style="padding-left:35px !important">(d) Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs.</h5>
<p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, retention and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.</p></br>
<h5 id="submit-ccpa" style="padding-left:35px !important">(3) How to Submit a Request Under the CCPA.</h5>
<p>You have the right to exercise your CCPA rights. You may submit a request to exercise your CCPA rights (1) as an individual; or (2) via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. </p></br>
<h5 id="submit-request" style="padding-left:35px !important">(a) Methods to Submit a Request.</h5>
<p>As permitted by the CCPA, any request you submit to us must be a Verifiable Consumer Request. This means that your request is subject to an identification and residency verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), or Right to Delete request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected Personal Information.</p></br>
<p>We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p></br>
<p>In addition to the above, we verify each request as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to Know (Categories):</b> We are required to verify a consumer’s request to know categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by the Consumer with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the Consumer.</li>
<li><b>Right to Know (Specific Pieces):</b> We are required to verify a Consumer’s request to know specific pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the Consumer with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying the Consumer together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the Consumer whose PI is the subject of the request. If you fail to provide the data points we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know (Categories) request.
</li>
<li><b>Do Not Sell:</b> No additional verification required. </li>
<li><b>Right to Delete:</b> We are required to verify a Consumer’s request to delete to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by the Consumer with data points maintained by us, or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by the Consumer with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. If you fail to provide the data points specified above, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request.
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="agents" style="padding-left:35px !important">(b)Authorized Agents.</h5>
<p>Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of California Consumers, but we reserve the right to also verify the Consumer’s identity directly as described above. Authorized agents must contact us to submit a request by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b0c0c2d9c6d1d3c9f0d4dfc5d2dcd5dcd9c3c49ed3dfdd"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="deaeacb7a8bfbda79ebab1abbcb2bbb2b7adaaf0bdb1b3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <a href>here</a> and indicating that they are submitting a request as an agent. We will require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of the Consumer by providing, for example, evidence of the agent’s identity, proof of registration with the California Secretary of State (if the agent is a business), and at least one of the following evidencing proof of the agent’s legal authority to act on behalf of the individual Consumer: </p></br>
<ul>
<li>presenting a Power of Attorney granted under the Probate Code that we can reasonably verify; or
</li>
<li>signed permission by the Consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also require the Consumer to verify their own identity directly with us and to directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p></br>
<p>In the absence of any of the general conditions detailed above, we are entitled to reject any request submitted through an agent. In addition, the agent is subject to the verification standards applicable to the type of request(s) made.</p></br>
<h5 id="limitation-rights" style="padding-left:35px !important">(4)Limitation of Rights.</h5>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use, and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights. In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law.</p></br>
<h5 id="nevada" style="padding-left:35px !important">(b) Nevada Residents.</h5>
<p>Although we do not “sell” “covered information” of Nevada “consumers” as those terms are defined by Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes, you may contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2252504b5443415b62464d57404e474e4b51560c414d4f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bacac8d3ccdbd9c3faded5cfd8d6dfd6d3c9ce94d9d5d7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and register an e-mail contact address for us to provide you notice in the event we should do so in the future, at which point you will have an opportunity to be verified and exercise your opt-out rights under that law. Contact us in the same manner to update your contact email for notices. Changing your email elsewhere (e.g., informational requests, account information, etc.) will not update your Nevada notice contact information. It is your responsibility to keep your notice contact information current.
