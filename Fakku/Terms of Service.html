	<h2>Access to Content</h2>
	<p>Users may access and/or purchase content (as defined below) through the Services in a few different ways including: (i) Users can pay a monthly membership fee to view certain content for the applicable period of time ("FAKKU Subscription") or (ii) Users may purchase certain content, or products, from us ("Purchasable Good(s)") which are then unlocked on their Account if digital ("Digital Good(s)"), and delivered to them if physical ("Physical Good(s)").</p>

	<h2>Purchasable Goods</h2>

	<h4>Returns & Refunds</h4>
		<p>Most digital items will be accepted for refund when requested within 3 days of initial purchase. </p>
		
		<p>Most Most physical items will be accepted for refund when requested and returned within 30 days of initial purchase. </p>
		
		<p>Returns will be refunded to the original payment method.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Please note the following exceptions to our return and exchange policy:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sale price or discounted items are final sale and cannot be returned or refunded.</li>
			<li>Physical items returned for refund must be in good condition and sealed in their original packaging. Returned physical goods may be charged a restocking fee.</li>
			<li>Refunds will not be issued for digital purchases that have been downloaded. Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis and are issued at our discretion.</li>
			<li>We cannot provide returns for purchases made outside of FAKKU, such as from third-party vendors.</li>

			<li>At any time we may provide a refund, discount, or other form of compensation to some or all of our users ("reimbursements"). The amount and form of compensation are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of reimbursements in one instance does not entitle you to reimbursements in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide reimbursements in the future, under any circumstances.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Pre-Orders</h4>
	<p>All pre-orders are paid in advance and in full.</p>

	<p>Pre-order items will be shipped on the estimated release date listed on the product description. We reserve the right to change or delay a Purchasable Good’s release date at any time and for any reason.</p>

	<p>Please note, that if additional Physical Goods are purchased with a product that has not yet been released, the entire order will be held until all items are in-stock and ready to be shipped.</p>

	<p>You cannot pick up pre-ordered items in-person, such as at an event we are selling at, you must wait until the order is shipped.</p>
	
	<h4>Damaged, Defective or Undelivered Goods</h4>
	<p>If you receive a damaged, or defective product from us, please <a href="https://www.fakku.net/contact">contact us</a> to submit a claim for a replacement or refund, depending on the type of item. Proof of the damaged product must be provided with your claim to be accepted.</p>
	
	<p>If a package is shown as delivered but has not been received, please contact the mail carrier and then contact us. If it's determined that the package is lost due to mis-delivery by the carrier or theft, we will replace or refund your order.</p>
	
	<p>If you’re encountering issues with your delivery, please contact the mail carrier and then <a href="https://www.fakku.net/contact">contact our support team</a> to expedite the resolution of any transit problems with your package.</p>

	<h4>Third-Party Vendors</h4>
	<p>Our Purchasable Goods may at times be listed for sale on third-party vendor services. Please note, that purchases of our Purchasable Goods from third-party vendors do not grant you any promotional offers we may have included for the same item on our Services. Exclusive promotions, deals, bonus items, offers, or sales are restricted solely to our Services unless otherwise stated. </p>

	<p>Purchasable Goods bought on third-party services do not guarantee you support from our Services.

	<h2>FAKKU Subscription</h2>

	<h4>Billing Cycle</h4>
	<p>The payment for your FAKKU Subscription will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter until you choose to cancel your subscription. We will automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the corresponding calendar day to the start of your paying period. In some cases, your payment date may change, such as in the event that your Payment Method was not successfully settled, or if your starting date begins on a day not contained in a given month. Visit your "Subscription Settings" page on our service to view your next billing date.</p>

	<h4>Payment Methods</h4>
	<p>To use the FAKKU Subscription service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Payment Settings" page. You authorize us to charge any Payment Methods associated with your account in the event of your default payment method declining or no longer being available to us for your payment. You are responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, we will automatically cancel your FAKKU Subscription until you chose to renew it. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge you fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your payment. Check with your payment method service provider for more details regarding any possible fees.</p>

	<h4>Pricing Changes</h4>
	<p>We reserve the right to change our FAKKU Subscription pricing in any manner and at any time. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms, any price changes to your FAKKU Subscription will take effect following notice to you.</p>

	<h4>Cancellations</h4>
	<p>You can cancel your FAKKU Subscription at any time and will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your current billing period. We do not provide refunds for any partial periods. To cancel, go to the "Subscription Settings" page on our Service and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your FAKKU Subscription, your account will lose access to content restricted to the FAKKU Subscription at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will lose access, visit the "Subscription Settings" page.</p>

	<h4>Refunds</h4>
	<p>Payments for a FAKKU Subscription are nonrefundable and there are no refunds for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your current billing period. At any time we may provide a refund, discount, or other forms of compensation to some or all of our users ("reimbursements"). The amount and form of compensation are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of reimbursements in one instance does not entitle you to reimbursements in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide reimbursements in the future, under any circumstances.</p>
