<p><span>Users may use third-party services or content included in VidPowr, but they must be aware of these third parties’ terms and conditions and have given consent to them. Under no circumstances will the Owner be deemed liable in relation to the proper functionality or availability, or both, of third-party services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Registration</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Deleting User accounts and account termination</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Owner, in case of breach of the Terms by the User, reserves the right to suspend or terminate the User’s account at any time and without notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Responsibilities and duties of the User</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It remains the exclusive responsibility of the User to ensure their operations are in accordance with the applicable rules. The Service, in fact, should be understood as an instrument of mere support of the User and under no circumstances replace the advice given by an expert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In particular, with regard to the purchase of VidPowr, which is carried out autonomously by the User, who remains solely responsible with regard to the verification of compliance with the purchase of <a href="https://vidpowr.com/">VidPowr</a> to their activities and the provisions of law.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Purchase</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Purchasing process</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Any order placed is an offer to purchase the Service. Orders are subject to availability and are accepted at the discretion of the Owner. Users must select the desired Service, choosing the type and duration that best suit them, and check-out only after having carefully verified the information contained in the Order Summary Form of the Order. The Order is placed on confirmation of the Order and is subject to payment of the amount charged in the Order Summary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Order Processing Receipt does not constitute acceptance of the Order. The contract shall be concluded at the time of the Order Confirmation by the Owner to the email address provided by the User. The Owner reserves the right not to confirm an order, should one or more of the Services purchased be unavailable. In this case, the Owner will notify the User about the unavailability of the Services purchased within 5 working days from order – to the email address associated with the purchase – and will provide for a refund of any amounts paid by the User.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To place an order, Users must register on the site providing the requested data. The indicated prices include taxes, fees and charges of the law applicable. The Owner reserves the right to offer discounts and various promotions throughout the year. For more details on current promotions, the User is asked to contact the Owner via the contact information contained herein.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Recurring subscription&nbsp;</strong><strong>of Able Marketing products</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Some of the Services offered by Able Marketing LLC are available via recurring subscriptions. In this case, payments start from the date when Users choose a paid subscription or modify another existing payment plan. The subscription must be renewed at each payment cycle to maintain the benefits provided by the paid services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Automatic renewal&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Recurring subscriptions are renewed automatically through the payment method that the User chose at the time of purchase. The renewed subscription will last for an equal period of time as the original service period. Users may cancel automatic renewal at any time by changing their preferences for the payment method used. If the User cancels an automatic renewal, then Able marketing LLC will be&nbsp;forced to cancel their subscription when it runs out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Automatic update of subscription plans&nbsp;</strong><strong>on Able marketing websites</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Some subscription plans available on Able Marketing LLC website</span></p>
<p><span>be automatically updated in the event that the defined use thresholds as set forth in the User’s current plan are exceeded. In these cases, the subscription plan will be automatically updated to the level that fits the User’s needs in order to ensure the continuity of the provision of the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The methods of payment used correspond to the payment method the User has chosen for subscribing to the original plan. The User is obliged to check that these payment methods are valid in order to allow the automatic update of the subscription plan to function properly. If the payment methods chosen by the User result unfit or unsuitable for use, the Owner may be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The User is free to turn off this automatic upgrade feature through the Service interface or by contacting the Owner. In this case, however, if the User exceeds the maximum use thresholds as set forth in the chosen subscription plan and fails to independently perform the update to the respective necessary plan, the Owner might be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In any case, the Owner will attempt to do its best to alert the User via email upon approaching the maximum use thresholds and, therefore, about the need to update the current subscription plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Disabling the service, withdrawal and refund</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Users may discontinue the Service at any time using the tools provided in the interface of VidPowr or by contacting the Owner directly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When disabled, Users are not allowed to claim for payments already made even if these relate to unused portions of the Service purchased.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Owner reserves the right, however, in its sole discretion and without involving charges or obligation to Users generally, to grant reimbursement in very exceptional cases after evaluating the specific circumstances of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In accordance with the right of withdrawal, the User may, within 14 days from the date of activation or payment of the Service, make a refund request, by sending notice to the Owner via the contact information provided in this document and including any information necessary to identify the purchase to which the claim relates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refunds will be made within 14 days after receipt of the request using the same payment method involved during the original purchase.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Methods of payment</strong></span></p>
<p><span>VidPowr uses third-party tools for its payment processing and is not connected with any of the provided payment information – such as the credit card – in any way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the owner of any of such third-party tools refuses to authorize a payment, the Owner cannot provide the Service and will therefore not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Duration</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The duration of the Service is indicated at the moment of payment of the price and confirmed in the Order Confirmation email sent by the Owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Changing the payment plan</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Users are free to change the chosen payment plan at any time.</span><br><span>In case the User modifies their current payment plan, the portion of the previous plan that has not yet been used shall be converted into a bonus which can be applied to the plan the User is switching to, on a pro-rata basis and in the form of a free period.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a currency conversion is required, the exchange rate criteria set forth in the specific paragraph of the present document shall apply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Currency conversion</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The exchange rate is the one established by the payment processor. In lack of such a rate, VidPowr will use the rate established by the European Central Bank at the moment of the relevant transaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>The Service is provided “as is”</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Service is provided by the Owner “as is”, with no express or implied warranty for accuracy or availability.</span></p>

<p><span>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees, as the case may be, harmless from and against any claim or demand, including without limitation, reasonable lawyer’s fees and costs, made by any third party due to or arising out of the User’s content, use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, or violation of any third-party rights.</span></p>
