		<h4>Last Updated July 14, 2023</h4>
		<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose, and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>
		<p>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected. These purposes include but are not limited to event registration, event experience, event logistics, safety and security, payment processing, event related communications, to improve our products and services, fraud prevention, customer and market analysis, and to deliver more personalized services such as marketing and local event recommendations.</p>
		<p>We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.</p>
		<p>We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</p>
		<p>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.</p>
		<p>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</p>
		<p>Leap Conventions  has strong data protection controls including encryption of data when being transmitted to sub-processors, in order to protect personal information from unintended disclosure or misuse. We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
		<p>In case of a data breach, appropriate authorities and affected individuals will be notified by Leap Conventions  via the appointed Data Protection Officer within 72 hours of the breach.</p>
		<p>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</p>
		<p>Camera: Certain Leap Conventions  apps may use camera on an iOS or Android device. Any data from camera and other sensors is neither collected nor distributed by Leap Conventions and is used solely for the purposes of ticketing and registration services. Any personal data collected is saved only to the user's device with user consent and action.</p>
		<h3>The Leap Conventions /Client Relationship</h3>
		<p>Leap Conventions  acts as a data processor for and on behalf of partners and clients in event management related services included but not limited to registration and ticketing, credit card processing, event data management, etc. Personal data processed by Leap Conventions  on behalf of clients are not used by Leap Conventions  for any purpose other than the fulfillment of contracted services with said clients, or any other purpose outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
		<p>Being that Leap Conventions is an event management and ticketing service provider, customers are permitted to create accounts with Leap Conventions that allow them access to their personal data that has been processed by GrowTix. Access to personal data stored by our clients within the Leap Conventions system can be achieved by creating an account with GrowTix.</p>
		<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
		<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
		<p>GrowTix and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.</p>
		<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.</p>

		<h3>Data Deletion Policy</h3>
		<p>Data stored within the Leap Conventions systems is collected and processed with an end to service Leap Conventions clients and their customers in event related services. This personal data is defined as necessary data in providing contracted services for Leap Conventions clients and their customers.</p>

		<p><u>Your Rights and Choices</u></p>
		<p>California, Virginia, and other applicable U.S. State laws may grant you certain rights—subject to all applicable limitations, exemptions, or exceptions—regarding our collection and use of your personal information. These rights include, to the extent applicable and to the extent granted under applicable law:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The right to confirm whether personal information about you is processed and to access such personal information;</li>
			<li>The right to request the disclosures of (1) what personal information has been collected; (2) the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; (3) the business or commercial purpose for collection or selling personal information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information; and (5) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, also called data portability;</li>

		<p>The above rights are only exercisable by you where applicable law in the jurisdiction in which you reside actually grants you the right being exerted. When exercising your right to deletion (to the extent applicable), please identify the information that you wish to be deleted and whether you would like to delete your account. Please note that the exercising of your right to deletion will result in the deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you. This may result in our inability to further provide services to you in the future. </p>
		<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights.</strong> To exercise the rights described above only to the extent applicable law grants you such rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request to: </p>
		<p>Email us: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bfcfcdd6c9dedcc6ffd8cdd0c8cbd6c791dcd0d2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="93e3e1fae5f2f0ead3f4e1fce4e7faebbdf0fcfe">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
		<p>Only you or a registered agent (if and only as permitted under applicable law) that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you have a registered agent act on your behalf, we have the right to authenticate such agent’s authority to act. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
			<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
		<p>Response Timing and Format. Your request will be responded to within 45 days, and in any event, we will respond to you within the timeframe required under applicable law.  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
		<p>If we deny your request, you can appeal such denial by <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#68181a011e090b11280f1a071f1c0110460b0705"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="afdfddc6d9ceccd6efc8ddc0d8dbc6d781ccc0c2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
