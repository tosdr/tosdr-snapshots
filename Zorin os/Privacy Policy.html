                                        <h2>Transferring personal information globally</h2>

					<p>We operate on a global basis. Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred and stored in countries outside the EU. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests, in particular we will either:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>only transfer your personal data to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR; or</li>
                                                <li>ensure that transfers outside your country are subject to additional safeguards required under local law – for example, the EU Model Clauses pursuant to Article 46(2) of the GDPR or by relying on certification schemes.</li>
                                        </ul>
					<p>You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) as mentioned above. <a href="/legal/privacy/#contact-us">Contact us</a> as if you would like further information or to request a copy where the safeguard is documented (which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).</p>

                                        <h2>How we protect and store your information</h2>

                                        <h3>Security</h3>
					<p>We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned. Measures we take include placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members and Service Providers; destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
					<p>Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by websites or other services. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use, as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>

                                        <h3>Storing your personal information</h3>
					<p>We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this policy. In some circumstances, we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements.</p>
					<p>In specific circumstances, we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.</p>

                                        <h3>Transparency</h3>
					<p>We have never received any court orders, warrants, or other classified requests for any user information. We have also not placed any backdoors into Zorin OS, our Services, or any of our products and have not been requested to do so.</p>

                                        <h2>Legal rights available to help manage your privacy</h2>
					<p>Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information.</p>
					<p>We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the personal information requested to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance, if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>
					<p>You can exercise your rights by contacting us. Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.</p>
					<p>We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example, if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p>

                                        <h3>Right to access personal information</h3>

                                        </ul>
					<p>We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>for compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
                                                <li>for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>Right to restrict the processing of your personal information</h3>
					<p>You can ask us to restrict your personal information, but only where:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy; or</li>
                                                <li>the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or</li>
                                                <li>it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                                                <li>you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.</li>
                                        </ul>
					<p>We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>we have your consent; or</li>
                                                <li>to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                                                <li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>Right to transfer your personal information</h3>
					<p>You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller, but in each case only where:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you; and</li>
                                                <li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3 id="right-to-object-to-the-processing-of-your-personal-information">Right to object to the processing of your personal information</h3>
					<p>You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.</p>
					<p>If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

                                        <h3>Right to object to how we use your personal information for direct marketing purposes</h3>
