<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.              HOLIDAY PRIZES<br/>
7.1           Because of their complexity, we have certain special terms that apply to holiday prizes. These terms are set out in this section 6. Where holiday prizes include a place for a travelling companion (i.e. a holiday for the prize winners plus guest(s)) then these terms also apply to those persons.</p>
<p>7.2           [The holiday is provided by [NAME AND ADDRESS OF TRAVEL AGENT].]</p>
<p>7.3           [The holiday is for [NUMBER OF PEOPLE] to travel by [CLASS OF TRANSPORT AND TYPE OF CARRIER] to [TRAVEL DESTINATION] for [NUMBER OF NIGHTS] between [DATE] and [DATE] (excluding between [DATES]). The prize does not include travel insurance, the cost of transfers to and from airports or stations, food and drink, spending money, tax or personal expenses. Any other costs incurred in addition to those set out above and that are incidental to the fulfilment of the prize are the responsibility of the winner(s).]</p>
<p>7.4           [You will be responsible for ensuring that you and any person travelling with you are available to travel and hold valid passports, any necessary visas and travel documents for the holiday in question on the travel dates specified. [Dates once notified to the travel agent cannot be changed].]</p>
<p>7.5           It is the responsibility of the prize winners or any travelling companion (if applicable) to check any travel advisories issued by the Government and determine whether they wish to accept the risk of travelling to the holiday destination. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage suffered by any prize winners and their travelling companion (if applicable) arising out of their failure to follow any travel advisories issued by the Government.</p>
<p>7.6           The prize winners and their travelling companion (if applicable) must comply with and are responsible for obtaining any inoculation and complying with any health regulations required by any holiday prize destination country.</p>
<p>7.7           We will not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage suffered by any prize winners or their travelling companion (if applicable) if any prize winners or their travelling companion (if applicable) does not redeem a holiday prize as a result of any Government travel warning or advisory applicable to the destination country and/or countries. In particular, we shall have no obligation to substitute any alternative prize, cash equivalent or other compensation where a prize winners and/or their travelling companion (if applicable) fails to redeem a holiday prize for any reason.</p>
<p>7.8           Prize winners and their travelling companions must comply with the terms and limitations of airlines, other transport providers, and the venues involved in the provision of any holiday prize, including any insurance policy relating to the holiday. In particular, entrants must comply with all health and safety guidelines and instructions and all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>7.9           Where the United States of America is a holiday prize destination, the prize winners and any travelling companion will be required to apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). Applications must be submitted no later than three (3) days prior to the departure date. If this form is not lodged by both parties and within this time, they will be ineligible to enter the United States of America and will therefore forfeit their holiday prize.</p>
<p>7.10        All holiday prizes must be taken within six (6) months of the closing date of the relevant Competition, or within the time limit specified in the Specific Terms if different, or the prize will lapse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(b)     to execute a legal document to exonerate us from liability in a form prescribed by us in order to participate further in the Competition and/or redeem the prize.</p>
