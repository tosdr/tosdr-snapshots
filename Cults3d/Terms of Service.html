<h2>Article II: Pricing</h2>

<h3>a) Pricing Policy</h3>

<p>Prices can be displayed in several currencies (depending on current exchange rates): US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Japanese Yen (JPY), Chinese Yuan (RMB), Argentine Peso (ARS), Mexican Peso (MXN), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Brazilian Real (BRL), Russian Ruble (RUB), Australian Dollar (AUD), South Korean Won (KRW), Indian Rupee (INR), South African Rand (ZAR).</p>

<p>However, orders are charged in either Euros (EUR) or Dollars (USD) which may incur additional conversion fees charged by the banking institutions.</p>

<p>Prices are first displayed to site visitors without tax. When a design is added to the shopping cart, the prices are displayed including VAT.</p>

<p>VAT is only applied to the Cults commission as the marketplace acts as a transparent intermediary.</p>

<p>Sellers have the possibility to change their prices at any time they want.</p>

<p>The designs are invoiced according to the prices in effect at the time of the order validation on the Cults marketplace.</p>

<h3>b) Rules for the VAT application on Cults</h3>

<h4>How VAT works</h4>

<p>The VAT reform for e-commerce in Europe, which came into effect on July 1, 2021, establishes new rules to be followed in the VAT application.<br>
The VAT rate applied to the Cults commission will differ depending on the status of the seller, whether he is an individual or a professional seller, and on the country of the buyer.<br>
The seller status is determined according to the legal identity that he has declared in his personal Cults account.<br>
The buyer’s origin is determined according to the legal identity declared in their personal Cults account or, failing that, via their IP address.<br>
The revenues sent to the designer when they request payment are gross revenues. Each vendor will need to manage their own accounting and tax compliance according to their status and country of tax residence.<br>
Using the tools and information provided by Cults in their personal account, the seller will be able to declare or not to declare VAT on each of their sales revenues according to their tax status and the nature and identity of their customers.</p>

<p>CULTS cannot be held responsible for any false declaration by the seller resulting in an error concerning the applicable VAT rate.</p>

<h4>Case of an individual seller</h4>

<ul>
<li>If the buyer is a  European Union resident, the VAT rate applied to the Cults commission will be the one applicable in his/her country (VAD regime).</li>
<li>If the buyer resides in a country outside the European Union, no VAT is applied on the Cults commission (EXPORT regime).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case of a professional seller</h3>

<ul>
<li>If the seller is a professional whose company is based in France, the VAT rate applied to the Cults commission is 20% (NORMAL regime).</li>
<li>If the seller is a professional whose company is based in a European Union country and has a valid intra-community VAT number entered in his Cults account, no VAT is applied to the Cults commission (AUTOLIQUIDATION regime).</li>
<li>If the seller is a professional whose company is based in a country outside the European Union, no VAT is applied to the Cults commission (EXPORT system).</li>

<h2>Article IX: Information &amp; Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The creator agrees to be informed by this contract that the sale of rights to use his creation for making objects from this creation is likely to lead to a qualification creator merchant within the meaning of Article L121 -1 of the Commercial Code, requiring certain specific obligations, such as the entry in the Register of Commerce and Companies, the holding of a particular accounting, payment of VAT and other applicable taxes, and compliance with the rules on invoicing.</p>

<p>Indeed, under Article L121 -1 of the Commercial Code: “Are those traders who carry out acts of commerce and make their own occupation”.<br>
For the creator, repeat sales of the product of his or her work that generate substantial income can be regarded as an act of commerce and therefore fell within the scope of a regulated professional activity including the Labour Code, the Commercial Code and the General Code taxes.</p>

<p>Thus a person who usually sells his creations or any products on a marketplace and draws regular income, must create a business company. There is no minimum or maximum sales threshold. It is the regularity of the activity, its nature and profit organization set up to allow the justice to determine in each case these criteria and qualify some dealers traders.<br>
In this case the creator, considered a professional seller would be required to meet the particular legal obligations above mentioned non- exhaustive way.</p>

<p>Consequently, the designer shall undertake to fulfill all tax and social security obligations related to the sale of his creations.<br>
CULTS is not seller, it only pays the French VAT on its commission and therefore disclaims all liability for any fraud that may be made by creators outside the tax legislation applicable to traders.<br>
CULTS is authorized to disclose all necessary information to the tax authorities under request.</p>

<h2>Article X: Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>This Agreement is governed by French law.</p>

<p>The parties shall endeavor to settle amicably and in good faith any disputes that may arise between them on the interpretation, or partial performance or breach of this Agreement.</p>

<p>If the parties are unable to settle their dispute amicably, such dispute shall be submitted to a mediator of the Professional Chamber of Mediation and Negotiation (“CPMN”) for professional guarantees of independence, neutrality and impartiality.</p>

<p>For referral, it is sufficient that one of the parties mandated the mediator to arrange a meeting so that the other party must be present in the month following the request.</p>

<p>For the meeting, the mediator sends a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt letter to each party. The parties will share equally the costs of intervention by the ombudsman and commit to attend at least one meeting with the mediator, to explore with its regulatory competition the most suitable solution to resolve the dispute.</p>
