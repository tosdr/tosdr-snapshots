In providing the Service, we collect information provided directly by Customers and information about Consumers captured indirectly through the Xesto app, and from Consumers directly through a consumer web portal. We, Customers and Consumers are bound by the terms and permissions granted by Customers and Consumers under this Privacy Policy.</p><h4><strong>Information we collect directly from Customers about specific company, user, product and other information is shared only with that Customer and never shared other Customers or with third parties outside Xesto (or the group of companies of which Xesto is a part) without consent of that Customer, except as noted in this Policy.</strong></h4><h4><strong>Information we collect directly and indirectly from Consumers is shared with Customers only with permission from each user and never shared with third parties outside Xesto (or the group of companies of which Xesto is a part) without consent of that Consumer, except as noted in this Policy.  </strong></h4><p>Customers may see or use Consumer information that is made available through the Service, on a limited basis and subject to permissions granted by individual Consumers, consistent with the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.</p><h4><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h4><p>We collect the following types of information:</p></div><h4><strong>Information Customers provide us directly about their company and staff:</strong></h4><p>· Information provided by the Customer (e.g., company name, address, store locations, usernames, passwords, etc).<br/>‍<br/>· Information captured through the Xesto app (“<strong>App Data</strong>”) (e.g., salesperson, store location, time, etc)<br/>‍<br/>· Communications between Xesto and the Customer. For example, we may send them Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, training information, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that Customers may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p><h4><strong>Information Customers provide us directly about products and customers:</strong></h4><p>· Information about Customers’ products (“<strong>Product Data</strong>”) (e.g., images, models, sizes, cost, price, inventory quantity and location, etc)<br/>‍<br/>· Results of physical shoe fit tests (“<strong>Fit Data</strong>”) performed by us and/or Customers matching Consumers to Customer products. <br/>‍<br/>· Information about Customers’ existing customers from eCommerce and other records. </p><h4><strong>Information Consumers provide us directly and indirectly through the Service:</strong></h4><p>· Consumer Profile Data acquired through the Service (e.g., name, phone number, email address, etc). <br/>‍<br/>· Consumer Measure Data (including fit preferences, photos, 3D renderings of feet and measurements derived from them) captured through the Service and through other means. Xesto uses the Camera API to capture photos using the front RGB camera and the TrueDepth API to obtain depth maps and RGB frames (from the front-facing TrueDepth camera) that are used to create 3D models of consumer feet. The RGB and depth images of your feet are gathered from your device, only after receiving your additional consent. The images will be recorded by the TrueDepth camera (TrueDepth is a trademark of Apple Inc.). Xesto will use the information we collect to make recommendations through our services for you, including providing dimension information and size recommendations. We also use the information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.<br/>‍<br/>· Consumer Match Data derived from relating specific Consumer Data to specific Product Data.</p><h4><strong>Information Consumers provide us directly:</strong></h4><p>· Additional Consumer Profile Data (e.g., passwords, permissions, demographic details, etc) captured through the XESTO consumer web portal.</p><h4><strong>Information we collect automatically:<br/><br/>Analytics, Cookies and Log File information:</strong></h4><p>· We use third party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends of the Service.

A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device&#x27;s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by XESTO.<br/>‍<br/>· A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how users use the Service and may help us derive and provide reports. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p><h4><strong>Metadata:</strong></h4><p>· Metadata is collected, usually in association with the process of capturing and rendering images of Consumers’ feet. This data may include the device information, the user information and/or location information.</p><h4><strong>2.
