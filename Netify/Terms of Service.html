                <p>
                    You agree that our entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement
                    is solely limited to the amount you paid for such Service(s). We and our contractors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or
                    consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services or for the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some states
                    do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the extent permitted
                    by law. We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access
                    interruptions; (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3) loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or
                    liability resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier, password or host key; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors,
                    omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability resulting from the interruption of
                    your Service. You agree that we will not be liable for any interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind
                    (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the
                    possibility of such damages. In no event shall our maximum liability exceed one thousand ($1000.00) dollars. Indemnity You agree to release, indemnify, and hold
                    us, our contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, and the directors, officers,
                    employees and agents of each of them, including attorney's fees, of third parties relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Services provided hereunder
                    or your use of the Services, including without limitation infringement by you, or someone else using the Service with your computer, of any intellectual
                    property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of our operating rules or policy relating to the service(s) provided.
                    When we are threatened with suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide
                    those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in deactivation of your Services.

                    <h3>Account Misuse</h3>
                <p>

                    protect the information provided to you by eGloo. As part of the registration process, you are required to provide us certain
                    information and to update us promptly as such information changes such that our records are current, complete and accurate. You are obliged to provide us the

                <p>
                    You agree that the terms of this Agreement are severable. If any term or provision is declared invalid or unenforceable, that term or provision will be
                    construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining terms and provisions will
                    remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <h3>Non-Agency</h3>
                <p>
                    Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Dispute Policy shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the
                    parties.
                </p>

                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>
                    This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its conflict of laws principles. If
                    any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision will be modified or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary
                    and the remainder of the provision, as well as the other provisions will continue in full force and effect. Failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                    provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
