                <p><strong>d. Free or Promotional Trials</strong></p>
                <p>From time to time, to the extent legally permitted, ConnectWise may offer free or reduced rate
                    promotional trials of certain Subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment or for a
                    reduced promotional price. If ConnectWise offers Customer a free or promotional trial, the specific
                    terms of the free or promotional trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the
                    particular trial, during the online registration process when the code for the trial is entered on
                    the
                    Site.</p>
                <p>ONCE THE FREE OR PROMOTIONAL TRIAL ENDS, CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES CONNECTWISE (OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT
                    PROCESSOR) TO BEGIN CHARGING CUSTOMER'S DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR
                    CUSTOMER'S
                    SUBSCRIPTION (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS THE SUBSCRIPTION
                    CONTINUES,
                    UNLESS CUSTOMER CANCELS THE SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE OR PROMOTIONAL TRIAL OR
                    OTHERWISE
                    CANCELS THE SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELING CUSTOMER'S
                    SUBSCRIPTION ARE DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 9(b) AND 9(c) ABOVE.</p>
                <p><strong>e. Pricing and Availability</strong></p>
                <p>All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional.
                    ConnectWise reserves the right to adjust prices as ConnectWise may determine in its sole discretion,
                    at
                    any time and without notice; provided, however, that if ConnectWise changes the amounts or other
                    charges
                    associated with Customer's Subscription, ConnectWise will use reasonable efforts to provide advance
                    notice of such changes in accordance with this Section. ConnectWise will not, however, be required
                    to
                    notify Customer of changes in any applicable taxes. The Service, Site and Subscriptions are subject
                    to
                    availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or part
                    of
                    an order, or to discontinue offering certain Services or Subscriptions without prior notice, even if
                    Customer has already placed an order.</p>
                <p><strong>f. Payment and Billing Information</strong></p>
                <p>By providing a payment method that ConnectWise accepts, Customer represents and warrants that
                    Customer is
                    authorized to use the designated payment method and that Customer permits ConnectWise (or our third
                    party payment processor) to charge Customer's payment method for the total amount of Customer's
                    Subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges). If the payment
                    method
                    cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, Customer's order or Subscription may
                    be
                    suspended or cancelled. Customer must resolve any problem ConnectWise encounters in order to proceed
                    with Customer's order. In the event Customer wants to change or update payment information
                    associated
                    with Customer's account, Customer can do so by logging into the Services and editing the payment
                    information. Customer acknowledges that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers,
                    changes to
                    your Subscription or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and Customer authorizes
                    ConnectWise
                    (or our third party payment processor) to charge Customer's payment method for the corresponding
                    amount.
                </p>
                <p><strong>g. Taxes</strong></p>
                <p>Customer is responsible for any sales, duty or other governmental taxes or fees due with respect to
                    Customer's purchase of a Subscription. ConnectWise will collect applicable sales tax if it
                    determines
                    that ConnectWise has a duty to collect sales tax. ConnectWise will present any taxes that it is
                    required
                    to collect at checkout, but note that actual taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at
                    checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes
                    in
                    tax rates.</p>
                <p><strong>h. Non-payment and late fees</strong></p>
                <p>In the event of non-payment, ConnectWise will have the right, with or without notice, to suspend or
                    immediately terminate your access to the Service. We may determine whether or not to reinstate your
                    access to the Service upon receipt of payment in full of all sums owed. Any payment not received by
                    ConnectWise on or before thirty (30) days following the due date shall automatically be assessed a
                    late
                    payment fee equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum allowed by applicable law; or (ii) the greater of
                    ten
                    (10%) percent or $50. Any payment not received by ConnectWise on or before thirty (30) days
                    following
                    the due date shall also bear interest from the due date until paid in full at the lesser of one and
                    a
                    half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. If ConnectWise is
                    required
                    to use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable
                    cost of collection. These collection costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency's
                    fees, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.</p>
                <p><strong>i. Disputed charges</strong></p>
                <p>Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a credit, you must contact
                    ConnectWise in writing within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. You hereby waive any
                    right to
                    dispute a charge or receive a credit for a charge that you do not report within thirty (30) days of
                    the
                    date on the applicable invoice. To dispute an invoice, you must send ConnectWise a written itemized
                    description of the specific items you dispute as contained in such invoice. The parties agree to use
                    commercially reasonable efforts to timely resolve billing disputes.</p>

                <h3>20. Dispute resolution</h3>
                <p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and
                    claims with ConnectWise and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>
                <p>Except for small claims disputes in which you or ConnectWise seek to bring an individual action in
                    small
                    claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or ConnectWise
                    seeks
                    injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and
                    ConnectWise waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to
                    these
                    Terms, our Service or Site resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to
                    these
                    Terms, our Service or Site will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in New
                    Castle
                    County, Delaware in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of
                    the
                    Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and
                    hereby
                    incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the
                    rules
                    of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are
                    unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
                <p>You and ConnectWise agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service or
                    Site
                    is personal to you and ConnectWise and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual
                    arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
                    representative proceeding.</p>
                <p>You and ConnectWise agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of
                    this
                    Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §
                    1, et
                    seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these
                    Terms
                    and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and
                    substantive
                    decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court;
                    provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or
                    a
                    representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an
                    individual
                    arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of
                    class or
                    representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. If you
                    are
                    an individual, you and ConnectWise agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the
                    filing
                    fee and ConnectWise will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and ConnectWise agree that the
                    state
                    or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County,
                    Washington
                    have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
                <p>ANY CLAIM BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SITE OR SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITHIN
                    ONE
                    YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL
                    NOT
                    HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.</p>

                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
                    Florida, without reference to its choice of law principles to the contrary. The application of the

                    to
                    these Terms, the parties hereby expressly consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and/or
                    federal courts in and/or for Hillsborough County, Florida, USA, and each party hereby expressly
                    waives

                <h3>22. Force majeure</h3>
                <p>Neither party shall be liable for any delay in performing its obligations if such delay is caused by
                    circumstances beyond the party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, any delay caused
                    by
                    any act or omission of the other party, acts of God, war, terrorism, floods, windstorm, labor
                    disputes,
                    or delay of essential materials or services. The delayed party shall promptly notify the other party
                    of
                    the reasons for and the likely duration of the delay, whereupon an extension of time equal to the
                    period
                    of delay, but not greater than thirty (30) days, shall be granted to the delayed party. If the
                    period of
                    the delay shall exceed thirty (30) days, then the non-delayed party may cancel further performance
                    of
                    the delayed obligation, without any penalty whatsoever. This paragraph shall not apply to any
                    payment
                    obligations.</p>
