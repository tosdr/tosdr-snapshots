                <p>We use cookies on our websites, www.recargo.com; www.plugincars.com; www.plugshare.com; and www.pluginsights.com (individually a “Website,” or collectively, the “Websites”).  <b>By using any of our Websites, you accept the use of cookies and similar technologies in accordance with this Cookie Policy.  If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them following the instructions in this Cookie Policy so that cookies from our Websites cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device.</b></p>
                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
                <p>“Cookies” are a standard Internet technology that allows us to store and retrieve login and other usage information for every user of our Websites.  “Cookies” are small text files that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive or on your mobile device when you visit a website.  They allow our Websites to store such things as user preferences. Our Websites use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) when you close your browser. Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date far into the future and thus stay in your browser until they expire, or until you delete them.</p>
                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are useful because they help make your experience of using our Websites more enjoyable.  Cookies allow us to recognize your device (e.g., your computer, laptop or mobile device) so that your experience on our Websites can be tailored to your device. Cookies do not typically identify you by name as an individual, just the device you are using. We use cookies to save information such as passwords and preferences so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Websites, to deliver content, including advertisements, tailored to your interests, and to optimize the performance of our Websites. The information connected with the cookie can also be visitors' preferences and record session information, such as pages visited, interactions with website features, time spent on our Websites and language preference.  More specifically we use cookies for the following purposes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>To Store Your Preferences and Settings.</b> Settings that enable our Websites to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. We may save preferences, such as device (e.g., computer, laptop, or mobile device) language, browser, and multimedia player settings, so those do not have to be reset each time you return to the Websites. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. Cookies can also help you fill out forms on our Websites.</li>
                        <li><b>For Sign-in and Authentication.</b> When you sign into one of our Websites using your account, we may store a unique ID, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the Website without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the Websites.</li>
                        <li><b>For Security.</b> We use cookies to enable and support our security features, to detect fraud and abuse of or other malicious activity on our Websites and violations of our Terms of Use.</li>

You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising as described in the “How to opt out of targeted advertising” section of this Cookie Policy.</li>
                        <li><b>For Showing Advertising.</b> We may use cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen so you do not see the same one repeatedly.</li>
