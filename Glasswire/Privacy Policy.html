                    <p>Glasswire is committed to respecting your privacy. This Website Privacy Policy explains the ways
                        in which Glasswire, a brand owned by Domotz Inc, and its subsidiaries and affiliates
                        (collectively, ”Domotz”, “Glasswire”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect,
                        use, and disclose information about you through our websites including Glasswire.com and
                        Glasswire.com sub-domains (the “Site”).</p>
                    <p>This Website Privacy Policy was last updated in October 2021. We may change it from time to
                        time, so please check back regularly to keep informed of any updates.</p>
                    <h3>Data collection</h3>
                    <p>You may create an account with Glasswire to receive marketing communications, join our forum or
                        post on our blogs.</p>
                    <p><i>Information You Provide:</i> We collect, and associate with your account, any information that
                        you provide Glasswire when you use the Site, such as when you create an account, purchase a
                        product, or contact us. Information you provide us can include, but is not limited to, (a) your
                        name, email address, physical address, username, password, and other registration information;
                        (b) transaction-related information, such as billing and shipping addresses, and any other
                        information necessary to complete the transaction; (c) and information you provide when you
                        contact us.</p>
                    <p>We do not collect or store your credit card information. Our credit card processing service
                        provider will collect and store full payment card information from you.</p>
                    <p><i>Usage:</i> We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Site. This
                        includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you
                        visited before coming to the Site, and identifiers associated with your devices.</p>
                    <p><i>Cookies and other technologies:</i> We use cookies, web beacons and other tracking
                        technologies (“Cookies”) to provide, improve, protect and promote our services, as explained in
                        the Cookies Policy section below.</p>
                    <p><i>Third Party Sites and Social Media Features:</i> Our Site contains links to other websites
                        operated by third parties, such as social media companies Youtube and Twitter. These third party
                        sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and they may record information
                        about your browsing behaviour. Your interaction with these features is governed by the privacy
                        policy of the company providing them. We do not control what information these third parties
                        collect. Please review their privacy policies and your privacy settings on your social media
                        sites and think carefully before clicking on third party links.</p>
                    <p>We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that
                        provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and
                        online services in which we participate. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do
                        so in this Website Privacy Policy. Visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">allaboutdnt.org</a>

                    <h3>Data Use</h3>
                    <p>We may use the information we collect to provide, improve and protect our services, such as
                        for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delivering marketing communications about Glasswire-related services, products or
                            promotions. We may use service providers to send these messages on our behalf, but we do not

                        </li>
                        <li>Providing you with products, services, or information you request, for example when you
                            contact us for remote support and troubleshooting;
                        </li>
                        <li>Providing you with information about the Site or required notices;</li>
                        <li>Customizing your experience when using the Site;</li>
                        <li>Improving the Site and services that we provide, such as by better tailoring our content to
                            your needs and preferences;
                        </li>
                        <li>Generating and analyzing statistics about your use of the Site;</li>
                        <li>Detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement,
                            violations of law, or other misuse of the Site.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may also combine or aggregate any of the information collected through the Site or elsewhere
                        for any of these purposes.</p>
                    <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
                    <p>We do not share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the
                        delivery of Glasswire products and services without asking you first. We do not rent or sell our
                        customer lists.</p>
                    <p>The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:</p>
                    <p><i>Trusted Partners working for Glasswire:</i> Glasswire may occasionally use certain third party
                        service providers to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our services. These third
                        parties may access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with
                        this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p><i>Other users:</i> Certain features on the Site may allow you to share information with other
                        users, such as your name, email address and additional information. Please take care if you
                        choose to do so, as we do not control how these other users will handle your information.</p>
                    <p><i>Business Transitions:</i> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a
                        portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will use
                        reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the purchaser uses your personal information in a
                        manner that is consistent with this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p><i>Law & Order:</i> We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such
                        disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death
                        or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Glasswire or our users; or (d) protect
                        Glasswire’s property rights.</p>
                    <p>We may share some aggregated, anonymized and non-personal information publicly and with our
                        partners. For example, we may publish trends about internet speed, or statistics about the type
                        of electronic devices installed in the homes of our customers. This information may also be
                        shared with other users to help them understand their network as compared to others in the
                        Glasswire community, raise awareness about technical issues or help us generally improve our
                        system. We take steps to ensure this non-personal information is not being associated with any
                        specific user and we require our partners to do the same.</p>
                    <h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
                    <p>We use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies (referred to collectively throughout
                        this policy as “Cookies”) to provide, improve, protect and promote our services. Cookies help us
                        with things like remembering your username for your next visit, and allow us to collect
                        information about your browsing behaviour when you use our Site, including for example, browser
                        type, IP address, domains, page views, referring/exit pages, and information about how you
                        interact with our web pages. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked
                        to content on the Site. We may track this click-through data to help us measure the
                        effectiveness of our customer communications.</p>
                    <p>Our site uses first party cookies (i.e. cookies set directly by us to your device) as well as
                        cookies served by third parties for the purposes outlined below. Some of the Cookies the Site
                        uses only remain on your device while your browser is open (these cookies are known as “session
                        cookies”) while others remain for longer periods (these are known as “permanent cookies”). The
                        Site uses the following Cookies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Ads Cookies</li>
                        <li>Google Tag Manager Cookies</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept Cookies. However, they are an important
                        part of how our Site works, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove
                        cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the site.</p>

                    <p><i>Security:</i> We take security seriously and care about the integrity of your personal information.
                        We use administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of
                        personally identifiable information, including encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Sockets
                        Layer).</p>
                    <p><i>Retention:</i> We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to
                        provide you services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or
                        to enforce our agreements.</p>
                    <p><i>Where:</i> To provide you with our services, we may store, process and transmit information in
                        locations around the world – including those outside your country. Those countries may not
                        provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country, and may
                        be available to the governments or agencies under a lawful order of those countries. Where this
                        is the case, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that your personal information is
                        protected in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you consent to such
                        transfer to, and processing in, these countries. Information may also be stored locally on the
                        devices you use to access the services.</p>
                    <h3>Children</h3>

                        age of 16. If you become aware that a child under your care has provided us with information
