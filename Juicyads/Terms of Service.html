It is your responsibility to keep up to date and adhere to these policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in JuicyAds limiting or suspending the delivery of any services or participation in the Platform or may result in the termination of this agreement. Failure to abide by the applicable acceptable use policy will be grounds for JuicyAds’s immediate termination of this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>7.                   Payments to Publishers</strong></p>
<p>7.1               JuicyAds will pay you a percentage of the sale price paid by the advertiser for the advertisements displayed on the Publisher Websites as determined by JuicyAds. JuicyAds will receive a 25% default commission. JuicyAds will subtract this commission from your account balance on each transaction. Your actual commission rate may vary and is set at JuicyAds’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>7.2               JuicyAds deposits funds to your account balance daily based on the previous net seven date (payment of account balances vary between seven and thirty days). You may request to withdraw the balance at any time, on condition that the balance is greater than or equal to the minimum payable amount (generally $25, but some payment methods have higher minimums). JuicyAds will process withdrawal requests in accordance with the payment schedules and policies for the payment method selected. If your balance is less than the minimum payable amount, JuicyAds will not process the request until the minimum payable amount is satisfied.</p>
<p>7.3               You acknowledge that JuicyAds will only be liable to you for your revenue based on payments from advertisers that it has received without restrictions that constitute immediately-available funds to JuicyAds. While JuicyAds will use reasonable efforts to timely bill, collect, and clear payment from the advertisers, JuicyAds will not be liable to you for payments due but unpaid from advertisers. If payment from an advertiser is later reversed at any time, JuicyAds may deduct that amount from your future payments.</p>
<p>7.4               If you dispute any payment made by JuicyAds in connection with the Platform, you will notify JuicyAds in writing no later than 30 days after the disputed payment. Failure to notify JuicyAds within this period will result in your waiver of any claims related to the disputed payment.</p>
<p>7.5               JuicyAds will calculate your payment solely based on the records kept by JuicyAds. No other measurements or statistics will be accepted by JuicyAds or have any effect under this agreement.</p>
<p>7.6               JuicyAds will not be liable for any payment based on any of the following:</p>
<p>(a)                any fraudulent impressions or clicks generated by any person, robot, automated program, or similar device or for fraudulent impressions or clicks similarly generated on any advertisements, as reasonably determined by JuicyAds;</p>
<p>(b)                advertisements delivered to end users whose browsers have JavaScript disabled; or</p>
<p>(c)                 impressions commingled with a significant number of fraudulent impressions or fraudulent clicks described in section 7.6(a), or as a result of another breach of this agreement by you for any applicable pay period.</p>
<p>7.7               JuicyAds may withhold payment or charge back your account due to any of the items identified in section 7.6 or any breach of this agreement by you. In addition, if you are past due on any payment to JuicyAds in connection with the Platform, JuicyAds may withhold payment until you have made all outstanding payments. If you are in breach of this agreement, JuicyAds will not pay you for any advertising sold, including any existing, accrued, or pending earnings.</p>
<p>7.8               To ensure proper payment, you will provide and keep accurate contact and payment information associated with your JuicyAds account. You bear full responsibility for any fees incurred due to inaccurate information provided to JuicyAds. JuicyAds will deduct from a reissued payment any bank fees related to returned or cancelled checks due to a contact or payment information error or omission.</p>
<p><strong>8.                   Referral Bonus.</strong> JuicyAds will pay you a 20% revenue share for referring publishers who sell direct ad spots to advertisers. The 20% rate is based on JuicyAds’s commission, and is paid out indefinitely, subject to change. JuicyAds will not pay you for referring yourself, and you cannot be paid using more than one account. JuicyAds will not tolerate self-dealing, including through the fraudulent creation of several accounts for one individual&#8217;s use, and will terminate your accounts and permanently ban you from the Platform.</p>
<p><strong>9.                   Payments from Advertisers</strong></p>
<p>9.1               You will prefund your JuicyAds account with your advertising budget. You will pay all charges set in your JuicyAds account, and will pay all charges in U.S. Dollars or in any other currency that JuicyAds agrees to in writing. Unless JuicyAds otherwise agrees in writing, you will pay all charges in accordance with the payment terms in the applicable campaign settings, including any taxes. Charges are exclusive of taxes.</p>
<p>9.2               You waive all claims relating to charges (including any claims for charges based on suspected invalid clicks) unless disputed no later than 30 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on JuicyAds’s measurements for the campaign. JuicyAds is not required to extend credit to you.</p>
<p>9.3               You acknowledge that JuicyAds may share any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to it with companies who work on JuicyAds’s behalf, including payment processors or credit agencies, solely to check credit, effect payment to JuicyAds, and service your account.</p>
<p>9.4               JuicyAds may withhold deposit or charge your account due to any breach of this agreement by you.</p>
<p><strong>10.               Canadian Sales Taxes</strong></p>
<p>10.1           Doing Business Outside Canada. If you have provided JuicyAds with an address outside Canada, JuicyAds will assume that you are not a resident of Canada and that you do not have a permanent establishment in Canada, as both of these terms are defined in the Excise Tax Act (Canada), and accordingly, no Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), Harmonized Sales Tax (“HST”), or Quebec Sales Tax (“QST”) will apply to any charges for participating in the Platform.</p>
<p>10.2           Doing Business Inside Canada. If you have provided JuicyAds with an address inside Canada and payment originates from inside Canada, JuicyAds will assume that for tax purposes, you are based in Canada, and accordingly, GST, HST, or QST may apply to any charges for participating in the Platform. Sales taxes will be based on rates as published by the Canada Revenue Agency and otherwise as applicable for each Province in Canada on one or more occasions.</p>
<p><strong>11.               Autorenewal and Autopayments.</strong> Autorenewal is an optional service that JuicyAds offers to advertisers that allows advertising space to be automatically rebilled indefinitely and debited from advertisers’ JuicyAds account balance. If you subscribe to JuicyAds’s autorenewal service, you acknowledge the following:</p>
<p>11.1           You are responsible for management of your autorenewal settings, which you can enable or disable at any time via your online account.</p>
<p>11.2           Autorenewal amounts are identical to the previously agreed purchase price for each individual ad.</p>
<p>11.3           You will be automatically rebilled from your account balance for advertising space with autorenew enabled.</p>
<p><strong>12.               Advertiser Refund Policy; Balance Withdrawal</strong></p>
<p>12.1           JuicyAds will investigate all refund requests before issuing a refund. You will make all refund requests no later than 30 days after the initial purchase date. JuicyAds issues refunds at its sole discretion, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>(b)                If JuicyAds issues a refund, it will be provided only for undelivered advertising time due to outage, technical malfunction, or other reason justifying a refund as JuicyAds determines in its sole discretion, and will not include delivered advertising time or delivered ad impressions.</p>
<p>(c)                 JuicyAds may issue a full or partial refund if you provide JuicyAds with proof of prohibited use by a participating publisher.</p>
<p>(d)                Any participating publisher, or JuicyAds, can refund any advertiser ad at any time in their sole discretion.</p>
<p>(e)                  If JuicyAds cancels or terminates your account because you breached this agreement, JuicyAds will not issue you a refund.</p>
<p>(f)                If JuicyAds gives you a refund, your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the payment/deposit. JuicyAds will not make refunds to any other payment method than the payment method originally used. No exceptions.</p>
<p>12.2           Once you make an initial deposit, you may request a withdrawal of your account balance if you are not satisfied with the Platform and you are otherwise in compliance with this agreement. Any refund issued under this section 12.2 is subject to section 12.1(g).</p>
<p><strong>13.               Publisher Ad Implementation</strong></p>
<p>13.1           You will comply with all specifications provided by JuicyAds for the proper display of ads in connection with the Platform. JuicyAds prohibits modification or abuse of advertising display or manipulation of ad code.</p>
<p>13.2           You acknowledge the following:</p>
<p>(a)                You are responsible for accurate ad pricing and purchase prices provided to participating advertisers. JuicyAds will not be liable for any errors related to ad pricing.</p>
<p>(b)                You will select accurate settings for the Publisher Website category, niche, or rating. JuicyAds may change or restrict your settings if they are inaccurate.</p>
<p>(c)                 Your use of ad zones in connection with “Float Ad” or In-Video placements, including “Pre-Loads” or “Post-Roll,” is allowed only with the “300&#215;250 for Layer/Float/Video Ads” advertising type and requires that a “Close” button/link be immediately clickable by the end user.

<p><strong>14.               Ad Delivery</strong></p>
<p>14.1           You acknowledge that for direct buy ads, the click statistics provided are based on past performance of other advertisers and might not reflect the actual traffic they may receive. Actual clicks to an advertiser’s website will vary and may be higher or lower than past performance.</p>
<p>14.2           Ad delivery depends on the advertising type and the way the advertiser is paying for it. For example, depending on the advertising type (Direct Buy, Network Ads, PopUnders, or Redirects), ads may be delivered by time, clicks, or impressions. Payment methods may include flat rate, pay per click, pay per impression, pay per action, or any combination of these.</p>
<p>14.3           You may have your transactions voided or partially credited if they fail to deliver purchased ad space and time. Refunds will be at the sole discretion of JuicyAds. These circumstances include:</p>

<p>(d)                Interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Site;</p>
<p>(e)                Bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, malware, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS), or other disabling code that may be transmitted to or through the Site by any person or that might infect your computer or affect your access to or use of the Platform, the services, the Site, or your other services, hardware, or software;</p>
<p>(f)                  Incompatibility between the Platform, the services, or the Site and your other services, hardware, or software;</p>
<p>(g)                Delays or failures you might experience in starting, conducting, or completing any transmissions to or transactions through or with the Site; or</p>
<p>(h)                Loss or damage incurred because of the use of any content posted, emailed, sent, or otherwise made available through the Site.</p>
<p>24.3           JuicyAds will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages that JuicyAds could not reasonably have foreseen on entry into this agreement. Further, JuicyAds will not be liable to you—regardless of theory of liability and even if you advised JuicyAds of the possibility of these damages—for damages for: (a) loss of use; (b) loss of services; (c) loss of profits; (d) loss of revenues; (e) loss of goodwill; (f) loss of contracts; (g) loss of data; (h) loss of privacy; (i) loss of business or opportunity; (j) computer failure related to your access of or your inability to access the Platform, the services, or the Site; or (k) cost of obtaining substitute services related to the Platform, the services, or the Site.</p>
<p>24.4           Except as stated in this agreement, neither party will be liable to the other party for indirect, incidental, special, statutory, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from this agreement, regardless of theory of liability and even if that party has been advised of the possibility of these damages, including loss of revenue or anticipated profits or lost business.</p>
<p>24.5           JuicyAds’s total cumulative liability to you will not exceed the greater of the total amount owed to you under this agreement and $500.</p>
<p><strong>25.               Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>25.1           In General. You will pay JuicyAds for any loss of JuicyAds’s that is caused by your (a) use of the Platform or services, (b) advertisements, (c) Publisher Websites, (d) selection and use of targets, (e) breach of this agreement, (f) actual or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, (g) actual or alleged violation of any other third-party rights, (h) actual or alleged violation of applicable law, (i) actual or alleged fraudulent or deceptive conduct or trade practices, or (j) any other actual or alleged tortious acts or omissions. But you are not required to pay if the loss was caused by JuicyAds’s actual intentional misconduct.</p>
<p>25.2           Definitions</p>
<p>(a)                “Loss” means an amount that JuicyAds is legally responsible for or pays in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages.</p>
<p>(b)                A loss is “caused by” an event if the loss would not have occurred without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.</p>
<p>25.3           JuicyAds’s Duty to Notify. JuicyAds will notify you before the 15th business day after JuicyAds knows or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be obligated to pay. JuicyAds’s failure to timely notify you does not terminate your obligation, except to the extent that the failure prejudices your ability to defend the claim or mitigate losses.</p>
<p>25.4           Legal Defense of a Claim</p>
<p>(a)                JuicyAds’s Control. JuicyAds has control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless JuicyAds directs you to control the defense.</p>
<p>(b)                Direction to Control. If JuicyAds directs you to control the defense, each of the following applies:</p>
<p>(i)                  You may choose and retain legal counsel.</p>
<p>(ii)                JuicyAds may retain its own legal counsel at its expense.</p>
<p>(iii)               You will not settle any litigation without JuicyAds’s written consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on JuicyAds, (2) admits JuicyAds’s fault, or (3) does not fully release JuicyAds from liability.</p>
<p>(c)                 Good Faith. You and JuicyAds will cooperate with each other in good faith on a claim.</p>
<p>25.5           No Exclusivity. JuicyAds’s rights under this section 25 do not affect other rights that JuicyAds might have.</p>
<p><strong>26.               Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>26.1           Litigation Election. Either party may elect to litigate the following type of case or controversy: (a) an action seeking equitable relief, (b) a dispute related to claims subject to indemnification under section 25, or (c) a suit to compel compliance with this section 26.</p>
<p>26.2           Negotiation. Each party will give the other a reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this agreement. The parties will first meet and negotiate with each other in good faith to try to resolve all disputes between the parties arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement. The party raising a dispute will submit to the other party a written notice and supporting material describing all issues and circumstances related to the dispute (a “dispute notice”). A primary representative designated by each party will try to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>26.3           Arbitration</p>
<p>(a)                If the parties’ primary representatives are unable to resolve the dispute no later than 30 days after receiving the dispute notice, the parties will settle any unresolved dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this agreement, or the breach of it, by arbitration administered by the ADR Institute of Saskatchewan in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that any part of this agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>(b)                A single arbitrator will preside over the arbitration and issue a final award on all issues submitted to the arbitrator. The arbitrator may grant any relief that would be available in a court, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement. The arbitrator’s award will bind the parties and any court of competent jurisdiction may enter it as a judgment.</p>
<p>(c)                 Arbitration will take place in Regina, Saskatchewan, and the language of the arbitration will be English. Subject to the prevailing party’s rights under section 26.6, the parties will bear equally the costs of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, and each party will bear the costs associated with its case. Unless required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this agreement without the advance written consent of both parties.</p>
<p>26.4           Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge that breach by you of your obligations under this agreement could cause irreparable harm for which damages would be an inadequate remedy. If any breach occurs or is threatened, JuicyAds may seek an injunction, a restraining order, or any other equitable remedy, in each case without posting a bond or other security.</p>
<p>26.5           Jurisdiction and Venue. If a party brings any litigation proceeding authorized under section 26.1, that party will bring that proceeding only in the courts of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and each party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of those courts for purposes of any proceeding. Each party hereby waives any claim that any proceeding brought in accordance with this section 26.5 has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of that proceeding is improper.</p>
<p>26.6           Recovery of Expenses. In any proceedings between the parties arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party, in addition to any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section 26.6, “prevailing party” means, for any proceedings, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the prevailing party. If any proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of settlement of that dispute, neither party will be the prevailing party in those proceedings.</p>
<p>26.7           Jury Trial Waiver. Each party hereby waives its right to a trial by jury in any proceedings arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.</p>
<p>26.8           Class Action Waiver. The parties will conduct all proceedings to resolve a dispute in any forum on an individual basis only. Neither you nor JuicyAds will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. The parties will not combine any proceeding with another without the advanced written consent of all parties to all affected proceedings.</p>
<p>26.9           Limited Time to Bring Claims. A party will not bring a claim arising out of, or related to the subject matter of, this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.</p>
<p><strong>27.               Termination; Cancellation</strong></p>
<p>27.1           By JuicyAds. JuicyAds may, at any time, (1) terminate the Platform, (2) suspend your account, (3) terminate this agreement, or (4) cancel one or more ads or your use of any target. JuicyAds will use reasonable efforts to notify you by email of any suspension, termination, or cancellation within a reasonable period.</p>
<p>27.2           By You. You may cancel any ads or terminate this agreement with or without cause at any time by deactivating a campaign in the campaign manager or by removing the ad codes from the Publisher Websites.</p>
<p>27.3           Effect. On termination of this agreement: (a) you will remain liable for any amount due for ads already delivered; and (b) all provisions of this agreement that by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including disclaimers and limitations of liability.</p>
<p><strong>28.               General</strong></p>
<p>28.1           Entire Agreement. This agreement and the <a href="https://www.juicyads.com/aup/">acceptable use policy</a> constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this agreement. It supersedes all earlier written or oral discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings, and agreements between the parties concerning the transactions contemplated in this agreement.</p>
<p>28.2           Amendment. JuicyAds may change the terms of this agreement on one or more occasions, on condition that changes will not apply to ongoing disputes or to disputes arising out of events occurring before the posted changes. JuicyAds will notify you through the Site or by email of any changes to this agreement. Changes will become effective when posted on the Site. It is your responsibility to check the Site periodically for changes to this agreement. If you continue to participate in the Platform after any change, JuicyAds will consider your continued participation as acceptance of the change unless you notify JuicyAds in writing of your disagreement no later than 15 days after the change. In your written notice, you must identify each change you disagree with and the reasons for your disagreement. JuicyAds will contact you no later than 15 days after receiving your notice of disagreement to address your notice and try to reach a mutually amicable resolution. If JuicyAds is unable to resolve your disagreement, your sole remedy is to terminate this agreement.</p>
<p>28.3           Assignment and Delegation. You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any performance under this agreement, except with JuicyAds advance written consent. JuicyAds may assign its rights or delegate its performances under this agreement without your consent. Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance in breach of this section 28.3 is void.</p>
<p>28.4           Waivers. The parties may waive any provision in this agreement only by a writing signed by the party or parties against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy, or in requiring the satisfaction of any condition, under this agreement, and no act, omission, or course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. A waiver made in writing on one occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver on any future occasion or against any other person.</p>
<p>28.5           Severability. The parties intend as follows:</p>
<p>(a)                that if any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, then that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that modification is not permitted by law, in which case that provision will be disregarded;</p>
<p>(b)                that if modifying or disregarding the unenforceable provision would result in failure of an essential purpose of this agreement, the entire agreement will be held unenforceable;</p>
<p>(c)                 that if an unenforceable provision is modified or disregarded in accordance with this section 28.5, then the rest of the agreement will remain in effect as written; and</p>
<p>(d)                that any unenforceable provision will remain as written in any circumstances other than those in which the provision is held to be unenforceable.</p>
<p>28.6           Notices</p>
<p>(a)                Form. All notices and other communications between the parties will be in writing.</p>
<p>(b)                Method. All notice will be given by (i) personal delivery; (ii) a nationally-recognized, next-day courier service; (iii) first-class registered or certified mail, postage prepaid; or (iv) electronic mail to the following addresses (or any other address either party may specify in writing):</p>

<p>(c)                 Receipt. All notices will be effective on receipt by the party to which notice is given, or on the fifth day after mailing or emailing, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>28.7           Governing Law. Canadian federal law and the laws of the province of Saskatchewan, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles, govern all matters arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.</p>
<p>28.8           Force Majeure</p>
<p>(a)                If a force majeure event prevents a party from complying with any one or more obligations under this agreement, that inability will not constitute a breach if (1) that party uses reasonable efforts to perform those obligations, (2) that party’s inability to perform those obligations is not due to its failure to (A) take reasonable measures to protect itself against events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event or (B) develop and keep a reasonable contingency plan to respond to events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event, and (3) that party complies with its obligations under section 28.8(c).</p>
<p>(b)                For purposes of this agreement, “force majeure event” means, for any party, any event or circumstance, whether or not foreseeable, that was not caused by that party (other than a strike or other labor unrest that affects only that party, an increase in prices or other change in general economic conditions, a change in law, or an event or circumstances that results in that party’s not having sufficient funds to comply with an obligation to pay money) and any consequences of that event or circumstance.</p>
<p>(c)                 If a force majeure event occurs, the noncomplying party will promptly notify the other party of occurrence of that force majeure event, its effect on performance, and how long the noncomplying party expects it to last. From then on, the noncomplying party will update that information as reasonably necessary. During a force majeure event, the noncomplying party will use reasonable efforts to limit damages to the other party and to resume its performance under this agreement.</p>
<p>28.9           No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This agreement does not, and the parties do not intend it to, confer any rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this agreement.</p>
<p>28.10       Relationship of the Parties. The parties intend that their relationship will be that of independent contractors and not business partners. This agreement does not, and the parties do not intend it to, create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the parties and the parties expressly disclaim the existence of any of these relationships between them. Neither of the parties is the agent for the other, and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.</p>
<p>28.11       Successors and Assigns. This agreement binds and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This section 28.11 does not address, directly or indirectly, whether a party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this agreement. Section 28.3 addresses these matters.</p>
<p>28.12       Further Assurances. The parties will take any further actions, or sign any further documents, as may be necessary to implement and carry out the intent of this agreement.</p>
<p>28.13       Electronic Signatures. Any affirmation, assent, or agreement you send through the Site in response to a prompt will bind you. You acknowledge that when you click on an “I agree,” “I consent,” or other similarly worded “button” or entry field using a mouse, keystroke, or other computer device, this action is the legal equivalent of your handwritten signature and binds you in the same way.</p>
<p>28.14       Voluntary Agreement. The parties have signed this agreement voluntarily and for valid reasons. The parties acknowledge that they (i) have carefully read this agreement, (ii) discussed it with their attorneys or other advisors, (iii) understand all of the terms, and (iv) will comply with it. The parties have relied on the advice of their attorneys or other advisors about the terms of this agreement and waive any claim that the terms should be construed against the drafter.</p>
<p>28.15       No Reliance. Each party acknowledges that in signing this agreement, that party does not rely and has not relied on any statement by the other party or its agents, except those statements contained in this agreement.</p>
<p>28.16       Permission to Send Emails to You. You grant JuicyAds permission to email notices, advertisements, and other communications to you, including emails, advertisements, notices, and other communications containing adult oriented material, sexual content and language, and images of nudity unsuitable for minors. Your permission will continue until you ask JuicyAds to remove you from its email list. For more information, please see the <a href="https://www.juicyads.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>28.17       Electronic Communications Not Private. JuicyAds does not provide facilities for sending or receiving confidential electronic communications. You should consider all messages sent to JuicyAds or from JuicyAds as open communications readily accessible to the public. You should not use the Site to send or receive messages you only intend the sender and named recipients to read. Users or operators of the Site may read all messages you send to the Site regardless of whether they are intended recipients.</p>
<p>28.18       Feedback. JuicyAds encourages you to give feedback about JuicyAds, the Platform, the services, or the Site. But JuicyAds will not treat as confidential any suggestion or idea provided by you, and nothing in this agreement will restrict JuicyAds’s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, or otherwise exploit any feedback, without paying you.</p>
<p>28.19       English Language. JuicyAds has drafted this agreement in the English language. No translation into any other language will be used to interpret or construe this agreement. All services, support, notices, designations, specifications, and communications will be provided in English.</p>
