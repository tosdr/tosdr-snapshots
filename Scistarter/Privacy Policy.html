Therefore, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of our use of your personal information. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it to third parties.Please note that this policy applies only to scistarter.org , scistarter.com, and scienceforcitizens.com and does not apply to any other companies, organizations or websites to which we may link. You should be aware that these other entities may have policy provisions significantly different from ours. Therefore, you should always review the privacy policy of any other website that you visit (whether from linking from our site(s) or independently) in order to determine what their policies are and how they use, collect and disseminate your personal information.You can delete your account any time by clicking here or by sending email to info@scistarter.org and requesting account deletion, and all data associated with your account will be deleted.I. CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT:A. Information You Provide to UsIdentifying information: When you sign up at SciStarter, you create a username (and, optionally, provide a real name) and provide an e-mail address and zip code. The e-mail address is not visible to other users, except project owners for projects you enrolled in, but others may see your username (or real name if one was provided ) in various contexts, including Profile pages and on project pages in the form of your ratings/reviews, bookmarks, or contribute to projects. Privacy preferences can easily be changed in Settings where you can tell us what information you&#39;d like public or private.B. Other Information We Receive and StoreUsage information: We also monitor and study how people use SciStarter and Science For Citizens websites, and aggregate data about visits and online activities. The following data may be recorded:log inspage viewsactivities including online ratings/reviews, bookmarks, contributions to projects, social sharing&nbsp; &nbsp;When you sign in, your username, real name, or an &quot;anonymous&quot; identity (depending on your Settings) is associated with these activities. Otherwise, they are associated with an IP address. &nbsp; If your profile is public, your username and link to your profile will be associated with participation in projects and listed on SciStarter webpages.We will never share your e-mail address with third parties without your express permission which includes projects you&#39;ve enrolled in (when you sign up for those projects through SciStarter, you give us permission to share your information with those project owners). We will also never share data we collect about you unless it cannot be associated with you or your username, it is necessary to accomplish the research goals of SciStarter or our university partners, or unless you give permission to third-party sites when you sign in to other sites using your SciStarter credentials or give your permission to affiliate your data with other citizen science platforms and projects (to track your contributions to projects, for example). Specifically, we may share your anonymized data with research study participants, other researchers, or in scholarly work describing our research. We may collect information from you as a result of your visiting our site and/or sending us emails including your domain name, IP address, the time you spend on our site, your email address, referral data, your browser type and version, your operating system and platform, pages you view, length of visits to pages and other browser interaction information.We may also gather certain generic information with respect use of our web site, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web site that they favor.

Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.www.scistarter.org, www.scistarter.com, and www.scienceforcitizens.com counts, tracks, and aggregates the visitor&rsquo;s activity into our analysis of general traffic flow at these sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from and how traffic flows within the sites). We may merge this information into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with potential advertisers, research firms, and business partners.
