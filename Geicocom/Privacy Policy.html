				<h3 id="summary">SUMMARY</h3>
				<p>This summary tells you the basics of our privacy commitment to you: how we collect and use your information, how we protect it, and who can see it. You should read the entire privacy policy below for full details.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We obtain information from you directly, from your transactions with us, and from third parties such as state motor vehicle departments.</li>
					<li>We do not and will not sell your personal information.</li>
					<li>Any third parties who perform services for us are required to safeguard any personal information that they process on our behalf.</li>
					<li>We use technical, physical, and administrative measures to secure and limit access to personal information.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="info_collect">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
				<p>Non-public personally identifiable information ("Information") is information that identifies you and is not available to the general public. The following sections tell you more about how and when we collect your Information.</p>
				<p>For California Residents, please click <a href="#california_residents_collection">here</a> to see the categories of personal information that we may collect.</p>

				<h4 id="info_obtain">INFORMATION WE OBTAIN FROM YOU</h4>
				<p>During the quoting, application, or claims handling processes you may give us Information such as your:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Address </li>
					<li>Phone number</li>
					<li>Email address </li>
					<li>Social Security number </li>
					<li>Driver's license number </li>
					<li>Date of birth</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you give us your email address, GEICO may use it from time to time to notify you of such things as new services, special offers, or to confirm transactions. If you do not wish to be contacted by email for non-policy related communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of any GEICO email you receive.</p>
				<p>If you are a policyholder, you can also log in to your account at geico.com, click on "Update Email Preferences" on the right side of the screen and choose the level of communication you'd like to receive from us. If you have not yet enrolled online, you will need to enroll with geico.com to update your email preferences.</p>

				<p>We may also collect Information when you visit our website. However, GEICO's website processes standard opt-out preference signals in a frictionless manner. You can implement a standard opt-out preference signal through any legitimate web browser. When our website recognizes a standard opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") signal, your Information will not be collected for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.  You can learn more about GPC by <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>

				<h4 id="info_trans">INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR TRANSACTIONS</h4>
				<p>We may collect Information about your transactions and experiences with us and others, such as your payment history, claims, coverage, and vehicle changes.</p>

				<h4 id="info_third">INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES</h4>
				<p>We may receive Information about you from service providers and third parties, like consumer reporting agencies that provide us with motor vehicle reports, claim reports, and/or credit information where permitted by law. When you ask for a rate quotation, we may obtain credit information if permitted by applicable state law. Our sales and service representatives do not have access to the details of your credit information. Other companies who view your credit report will not see the GEICO inquiry. It will be visible only to you. Our inquiry will not affect your credit score or credit rating. If you are purchasing a commercial policy, we may also confirm the motor vehicle records of the employees you will have driving on your company's behalf.</p>

				<h4 id="loc_mobile">LOCATION SERVICES</h4>
				<p>Your current location is only collected and used by us if you permit our services to do so. If you allow your location to be collected using a GEICO app, or with a browser, we will use this information to determine your estimated location. We use this information to distinguish your current location and provide location-related services to you.</p>

				<h4 id="access_corr">ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>If you are a resident of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, or Virginia, you have the right to request access to and correction of the personal information that we have collected from or about you. To do so, simply contact GEICO's customer service department. If you'd like to correct information that you provided to us, our representative will make the appropriate adjustments to GEICO's records. If you wish to correct personal information provided to GEICO by a third party (such as a credit rating agency) the representative will provide you with the applicable third party's contact information. Upon written request, we will provide you with a more detailed notice of these rights. Upon the request of residents of other states, we will take reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the personal information in our records.</p>
				<p>If you are a California resident, please go to the section of this policy titled "<a href="#california_residents">California Residents</a>" for information regarding additional rights you may have, including the right to know and right to delete, designated methods for submitting requests, and the categories of information we collect.</p>

All of these entities are obligated to keep the Information that we provide to them confidential and to use the Information only for the purpose for which the Information was provided.</li>
					<li>Information may be provided to organizations conducting actuarial research or audits. In this case, you will not be individually identified in any research report. The organization must agree not to redisclose the Information and the Information will be returned to us or destroyed when it is no longer needed.</li>

						<li>in the event of a business transaction involving the sale of all of or a portion of our business or assets in which case we will comply with applicable laws regarding notice and consent in such transfers</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="conf_security">CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h3>
				<p>We restrict access to your Information to personnel who we have determined need it to provide products or services to you. We train our personnel to safeguard customer information, and we require them to sign confidentiality agreements.</p>
				<p>We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Information from unauthorized access by third parties.</p>
				<p>Information about our former customers and about individuals who have obtained quotes from us is safeguarded to the same extent as Information about our current policyholders.</p>
