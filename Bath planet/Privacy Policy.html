<p><strong>Bath Planet</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Bath Planet&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;), is concerned about privacy issues and wants you  to be familiar with how Bath Planet collects, uses and discloses your  information in connection with our business. Accordingly, we have created this  Privacy Policy to describe our practices in connection with information that we  collect through: (1) in-person interactions, such as at trade shows, during  in-person market research, and at retail stores where our products are sold, to  name a few, (2) phone interactions, (3) websites operated by us from which you  are accessing this Privacy Policy (the &ldquo;Sites&rdquo;), (4) the software applications  made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the  &ldquo;Apps&rdquo;), (5) our social media pages and apps&nbsp;(collectively, our &ldquo;Social  Media Pages&rdquo;), and (6) HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that  link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Sites, Apps and our  Social Media Pages, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Except as otherwise expressly provided  herein, this Privacy Policy does not govern our collection of information  through any website not identified in this Privacy Policy or by any other means  other than through the Services; nor does this Privacy Policy govern the  collection of information by any of our Affiliated Entities (as defined below)  or by third parties.</p>
<p>We  encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before using the Services or  submitting your personal information to us. &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; is  information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable  individual.</p>
<p>Your use  of the Services signifies that you agree with all terms of this Privacy Policy,  so please do not use the Services if you disagree with any part of this Privacy  Policy.</p>
<h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
<p>Bath Planet reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. In the  event that Bath Planet makes a material change to this Privacy Policy,  it will be posted here. We encourage you to check this page regularly because  your continued use of the Services following any changes to the Privacy Policy  will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such change. You can determine  when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo;  legend at the top of this page.</p>
<h2>Notice Regarding Use of  the Services by Children</h2>
<p>The  Services are not directed to children under the age of eighteen (18), and we  request that children do not provide personal information through the Services.</p>
<h2>How We Collect and Use  Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will  collect personal information about you, such as your name, postal address,  telephone and mobile numbers, email address, credit card number or other  payment number, date of birth, gender, IP address, profile pictures, or social  media IDs through your use of the Services, such as when you create an account  or profile, order or register a product, order literature, enter contests or  incentive programs, sign up for newsletters, download an App, participate in a  survey, contact customer service, or otherwise do business with us or interact  with the Services. We may also receive your personal information from other  sources, such as affiliated entities, public databases, and cooperative  databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with  whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms; as well  as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social  media account to your Site account, certain personal information from your  social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal  information that is part of your profile or your friends&rsquo; profiles.</p>
<p>We use  your personal information to do business with you or otherwise provide the  services you request from Bath Planet such as responding to product  information requests; registering products; fulfilling orders for parts,  products, or customer service; initiating refunds; administering contests or  incentive programs; and facilitating on-line product visualization applications  and preferred products catalogs. We also use personal information to send you  news about our products and promotions, to conduct online surveys, contests,  other similar promotions or incentive programs via email, telephone, or postal  mail, and to notify you of special events and advertising that you might be  interested in. Please see the &ldquo;Sweepstakes, Contests, and Other Promotions&rdquo;  section below for more information on participating in such activities.  Further, we may also use personal information to send you important information  regarding the Services, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or  other administrative information.

In addition, we may use the information to improve Bath Planet&rsquo;s online  and other services, such as through customer service and product support, to  understand consumer preferences in developing product improvements and  innovations. We may also use your personal information for internal business  purposes, such as optimizing users&rsquo; Services experiences and analyzing,  managing, and expanding our businesses. If you apply for employment with Bath Planet, we may use the personal information you supply to process your  job application.</p>
<p>The  Services may offer a feature that allows you to send an electronic postcard or  otherwise share a message with a friend. If you choose to use this feature, we  will ask you for the recipient&rsquo;s name and email address, along with the text of  any message you choose to include. By using this feature, you are telling us  that you are entitled to provide us with the recipient&rsquo;s name and email address  for this purpose.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Through your browser or  device</em></strong>. Certain information is  collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your  Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh),  screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model,  language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the  Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to ensure  that the Services function properly.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Through your use of the  Apps</em></strong>. When you download and use  an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such  as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what  information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device  number.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Using cookies</em></strong>. Cookies  are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the  Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data. We and  our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate  navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your  experience while using the Services as well as for online tracking purposes. We  can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather  statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually  improve their design and functionality, understand how the Services are used  and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. Cookies  further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most  likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services. We may  also use cookies in online advertising to track responses to our advertisements,  and we may use cookies to track how you arrived at our site from another  website to improve your on-line experience with us. If you do not want  information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure  in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given  the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular  cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.

We use  Google Analytics, a Google service that uses cookies and other, similar  technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and  report on activities and website trends. We also use an enhancement to Google  Analytics called &ldquo;Demographics and Interest Reporting,&rdquo; through which Google  provides us with information about our users&rsquo; demographics (e.g., age, gender)  and interests. This information, which Google may collect by tracking a user&rsquo;s  behavior across third-party websites, helps us to learn more about our users.  You can learn about Google&rsquo;s practices in connection with this enhanced  tracking and opt out of it by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/home" target="_blank"><strong>https://myadcenter.google.com/home</strong></a>&nbsp;or  by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"><strong>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</strong></a>

    </li>
    <li><strong><em>Using Adobe Flash  technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (&ldquo;Flash LSOs&rdquo;)) and other  similar technologies</em></strong>. We may  use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store  information about your use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs  stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to  block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage  Settings Panel.

Please note that setting the Flash Player to  restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the  functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash  applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Physical Location</em></strong>. We may  collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite,  cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device&rsquo;s physical location to  provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also  share your device&rsquo;s physical location, combined with information about what  advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing  partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to  study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be  permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device&rsquo;s location,  but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing  partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized  services and content.</li>
    <li><strong><em>From you</em></strong>.  Information, such as your preferred means of communication is collected when  you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with personal information, this  information does not personally identify you.</li>

</ul>
<p>We may  use and disclose other information for any purpose, except where we are  required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat  other information as personal information under applicable law, then we may use  it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information.</p>
<p>In some  instances, we may combine other information with personal information (such as  combining your name with your geographic location). If we do combine any other  information with personal information, the combined information will be treated  by us as personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>

    <li>Whether there is a legal  obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to  keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can  delete them); or</li>
    <li>Whether retention is  advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable  statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul>
