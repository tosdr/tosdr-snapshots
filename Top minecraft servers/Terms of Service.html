<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<hr/>
<dl>
<dt>Agreement</dt>
<dd>
<p>By accessing TopMinecraftServers.org, its services, or any product or person in affiliation or agreements with the TopMinecraftServers.org website (collectively "<abbr title="Top Minecraft Servers">TMCS</abbr>"), you agree to follow and respect these terms and conditions (the “Terms”). If you do not agree to any of these Terms, please discontinue any further use of TMCS.</p>
<p>These Terms may change at any time without any notice, although an attempt to notify you of changes may be made. When changes are made to these terms and conditions, you agree to accept the Terms of Service and all alterations. It is your obligation to stay informed of updates to these terms and conditions, which can be found at http://TopMinecraftServers.org/terms.php</p>
</dd>
<dt>User Accounts</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>TMCS allows the creation of user accounts. This is done through submitting the form located at http://topminecraftservers.org/register.php. You will provide accurate information at the time of registration, and at any time that information may change or no longer hold truth, you will update your information to hold true and accurate information.</li>
<li>You hold yourself responsible for all actions taken through your account. Your account will be treated as you being the sole owner of it and all material posted held to you through your account. You will keep your account secure and notify us of all possible security compromises to your account. You will not share your account with any other person, wizard, vampire, werewolf, primate, pet, being, or matter other than yourself.</li>
<li>In cases where you break any of the Terms, or where the administration of TMCS feel appropriate, your account and all material connected to it may be banished (banned) and terminated from TMCS entirely. To appeal bans, you may contact a member of TMCS’s administration to attempt to appeal your ban, in which they may or may not accept your appeal. You will not attempt to get around your banishment in any way, and you will stop further use of TMCS.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Content</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>All content submitted by you on this website is solely your opinion and not that of TMCS. You claim all responsibility for content created by you on TMCS. You will not post or reference to content that may: (i) harm or offend anyone who may visit or use TMCS; (ii) break or disagree with any laws in the United States or any of its territories; (iii) conflict with any of the Terms; (iv) mimic or reference any content already posted on TMCS; or (v) be found unacceptable by members of the TMCS administration. If you’re not sure whether something may be acceptable, just contact a member of administration regarding the content.</li>
<li>Additionally, you will not link to, promote, or endorse content or software that: (i) is illegal in any United States territory; (ii) is pirated; (iii) goes against the terms and agreements of the authors of the content or software; or (iv) may offend or harm anyone else or their possessions.</li>
<li>Any content posted with a network of services are restricted to one listing for the entire network. Branches of that network may be posted in the listing, but only one single listing is allowed.</li>
<li>Automatic scripts are prohibited from reading content for purposes of manipulating systems of competition.</li>
<li>If you find any content on TMCS does not follow the Terms, please inform the administration of TMCS so that we may take care of any issues that arise. We will try to make sure content posted by users does not conflict with these Terms, but you will also help us in this as we simply cannot filter all content being posted at all times.</li>
<li>All other content provided by TMCS (such as images, html code, style sheets, information, etc.), selectively, is copyrighted material and may not be redistributed on any other site without the consent of the administration of TMCS.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Voting</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>You will vote once per day and will not attempt to vote more than once by any means. If you suspect someone of breaking this term, or are accused of breaking this yourself, you will contact a member of administration immediately, and the problem will be resolved as soon as possible.</li>
<li>The action of voting must be done by a person through our site. Programs that vote on a user's behalf, vote automatically(bot), or allow users to vote on external pages are not allowed.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Advertisements</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>TMCS holds advertisements on its servers. These advertisements are provided by third-party companies, and the materials and opinions of the advertisements are that of the advertiser. Advertisements are not endorsed by TMCS and we hold no responsibility for content posted by an advertisement. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here, here, here, and here. These companies may use cookies to serverelevant ads based on prior visits to the site.</li>
<li>If an advertisement expresses or leads to content that may be potentially dangerous, harmful, threatening, obscene, foul, illegal, or disapproved of in any way, then please contact a member of administration regarding the issue. Be sure to include specific information about the advertisement as this will help us file a report to keep the advertisement off of our servers. If the advertisement is seen to be unclean for TMCS, then we will work to blacklist the advertisement from being displayed.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Indemnity</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless TMCS and its administration from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to TMCS; (ii) your violation of any term in these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that content created or endorsed by you caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of TMCS.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>General</dt>
<dd>
<ol type="A">
<li>TMCS may at any time send notices or alerts to your email, phone, or any other means of contact that you provide.</li>
<li>If TMCS does not enforce any of the Terms, this does not mean TMCS has given up its right to do so, and TMCS may, at any time pick up on its enforcement of the Terms if not done immediately.</li>
<li>Any action taken with the intent of circumventing these terms is prohibited.</li>
<li>If you feel any of the Terms are unfair or should be modified, feel free to contact a member of administration regarding them. This does not mean you will be excluded from any Terms. If we feel your claim is valid, we may or may not make amendments to the Terms.</li>
<li>Should a statement in the Terms be nullified, the remaining terms stand and still apply.</li>
