    <h2>Your Privacy; Use of Service by Children</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1</strong> In order to use the Service you, or your School or Parent or Guardian on your behalf, will be required to provide certain personally identifiable information to Membean <em>(e.g., your first and last name, the name of the School on whose behalf you use the Service, your Student identification number, your e-mail address, and, if applicable, your credit card information)</em>. Membean will only use such personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of our <a href="/policies/privacy.html">privacy policy</a> <em>(the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;)</em>.

You hereby agree that we may use your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2</strong> Membean collects limited personal information from minor Students, but only where that Student’s School or Parent or Guardian has contracted with Membean to collect personal information from Students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Membean requires Schools and/or Teachers to obtain Consent from Students’ Parents or Guardians before collecting any such personal information. If you are a Student, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you are able to sign up for the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a Student without a Consent being obtained by his or her School and/or Teacher, or if we learn a Student has provided us personal information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Service, we will permanently delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a Student may have provided us personal information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Service, or that a Student's School or Teacher has not obtained a valid Consent prior to our collection of any personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@membean.com">support@membean.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>19.6</strong> Membean may assign or transfer its rights, or delegate any performance, under these Terms to a third party in its sole discretion.
