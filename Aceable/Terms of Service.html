STUDENT further agrees to use the Mobile App and/or Online course and the Information for lawful purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>LICENSE GRANT.</strong> ACEABLE grants STUDENT a limited, personal, non-assignable, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and license to use the Mobile App and/or Online course and the Information on a single computer until ACEABLE terminates this CONTRACT or STUDENT’s access rights; provided and expressly conditioned upon STUDENT’s agreement that all such access and use shall be governed by all of the terms and conditions set forth in this CONTRACT and provided that STUDENT does not (and does not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Information.

ACEABLE does not warrant that the functions contained in the Mobile App and/or Online course will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected or that the Mobile App and/or Online course or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful components and all such warranties are expressly disclaimed. STUDENT assumes the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. STUDENT assumes full responsibility for implementing sufficient procedures and checks to satisfy his or her requirements for the accuracy and sustainability of the Mobile App and/or Online course.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to STUDENT. This warranty gives student specific legal rights. STUDENT may also have other rights which vary from state to state.</p>
<p>STUDENT agrees that in no event shall ACEABLE (including its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives or subcontractors) be liable for and STUDENT releases ACEABLE from any liability for the following: (i) any decision or action taken, or not taken by STUDENT in reliance upon the information contained or provided through the Mobile App and/or Online course; (ii) any conduct contemplated by this CONTRACT or in any other manner related to STUDENT’s use of the Mobile App and/or Online course; (iii) any errors, inaccuracies, omissions or other defects in, or untimeliness or lack of authenticity of, the Mobile App and/or Online course or for any delay or interruption in the transmission to STUDENT, or for any claim or loss arising therefrom or occasioned thereby. STUDENT further agrees that in no event shall ACEABLE be liable for and STUDENT releases ACEABLE from many any and all non-direct damages, including but not limited to, any special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages whether or not arising out of or related to this CONTRACT. In no event shall ACEABLE’s total aggregate liability for all damages, losses and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including, but not limited to, negligence and strict liability), or otherwise) arising out of or related to this CONTRACT, the Mobile App and/or Online course, and/or use of ACEABLE’s web site and mobile application, exceed the cost of tuition paid by STUDENT foe the Mobile App and/or Online course even if ACEABLE or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages. If and to the extent any payment required to be made under this CONTRACT or damage limitation set forth herein is deemed to constitute liquidated damages, STUDENT acknowledges and agrees that such damages are difficult and impossible to determine and that such payment is intended to be a reasonable approximation of the amount of such damages and not a penalty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained here, STUDENT’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this CONTRACT and/or any liability arising out of or related to this CONTRACT and/or the Mobile App and/or Online course shall be a refund of the tuition paid by STUDENT for the Mobile App and/or Online course. This limited liability shall be complete and exclusive. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply. This clause gives STUDENT specific legal rights. STUDENT may also have other rights which vary state by state.</p>
<p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION.</strong> STUDENT agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ACEABLE, its subsidiaries, licensors, affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives or subcontractors, for any against all claims or demands, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from or related to STUDENT’s access, connection to, or use of, or STUDENT’s inability to use, access or connect to the Mobile App and/or Online course (including the Information obtained through the Mobile App and/or Online course), STUDENT’s violation of this CONTRACT, or STUDENT’s violation of any rights of another.</p>
<p><strong>DELAYS IN SERVICES.</strong> Any delays in or failure of performance by ACEABLE or any of its licensors, service providers or service sponsors (including its and their officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives and subcontractors) shall not give rise to any claims for damages, or any loss or liability, if and to the extent caused by interruptions due to electronic or mechanical equipment failures, telephone interconnect problems, defects, or occurrences beyond ACEABLE’s control, including but not limited to acts of governmental authority, weather, fire, floods, explosions, acts of God, strikes or other concerted acts of workers, riots, armed conflicts, acts of war, or sabotage. ACEABLE shall have no responsibility to provide STUDENT access to the Mobile App and/or Online course while interruption of the Mobile App and/or Online course due to any such or similar cause shall continue.</p>
<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT.</strong> STUDENT assigns and grants all right, title and interest to ACEABLE to gather, process, analyze, and retain any of the information STUDENT voluntarily supplies during STUDENT’s use of the Mobile App and/or Online course. STUDENT consents to the disclosure by ACEABLE of any of this information to third party entities in accordance with the Privacy Policy posted on ACEABLE’s Web Site and Mobile Application, and incorporated herein by reference. STUDENT consents to the aggregation of his or her non-identifying information with like information from other people, and consents to the release of such aggregated information to other parties, including but not limited to the sponsors or third party service providers of ACEABLE. STUDENT agrees that ACEABLE may mail him or her or email him or her information about ACEABLE programs or events. This CONTRACT shall not be assigned in whole or in part by STUDENT without the prior written consent of ACEABLE and any attempted assignment in contravention of this section shall be void.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICES.</strong> Notices to STUDENT may be made via either email, regular mail or by displaying notices or links to notices generally on ACEABLE’s Web Site and Mobile Application.</p>
<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY.</strong> THE ACEABLE Privacy Policy may be found from a link at the bottom of the ACEABLE home page. By accepting the CONTRACT, STUDENT agrees that he or she has read, understands and agrees to the PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM SELECTION.</strong> The CONTRACT is construed under the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. STUDENT agrees that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Mobile App and/or Online course can be filed only and exclusively in a state or federal court located in Austin, Texas, and STUDENT irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of the Mobile App and/or Online course. STUDENT knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and irrevocably waives any available affirmative defenses under federal law or any states' laws to venue and jurisdiction in Austin, Texas, including without limitation improper venue, forum non conveniens, lack of in personam jurisdiction, and all related defenses. STUDENT agrees that this forum-selection clause shall apply to any and all claims under federal law or any states' laws and that arise from or relate in any way to the Mobile App and/or Online course, including, without limitation, contract, tort, and all other statutory or common law claims seeking equitable or legal relief, whether asserted as a cause of action, counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, or otherwise, and whether asserted on an individual basis or as putative representative of a class.</p>
<p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> For disputes arising between STUDENT and ACEABLE, or any other user, STUDENT and ACEABLE agree that each can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. Neither STUDENT nor ACEABLE can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. If a court decides that this “Class Action Waiver” section is not enforceable or is invalid, then this section shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the CONTRACT will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.</strong> STUDENT knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and irrevocably waives his or her rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or in any manner relating to this CONTRACT and/or ACEABLE’s performance or failure to perform. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing and shall apply to any and all claims arising under federal law or any states' laws and that arise from or relate in any way to the subject matter of the CONTRACT and/or ACEABLE’s performance, including, without limitation, contract, tort, and all other statutory or common law claims seeking equitable or legal relief, whether asserted as a cause of action, counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, or otherwise, and whether asserted on an individual basis or as putative representative of a class. STUDENT expressly acknowledges that this provision is an essential aspect of the bargain embodied by the CONTRACT. If a court decides that this “Waiver of Right to Jury Trial” section is not enforceable or is invalid, then this section shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the CONTRACT will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIMS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong> Subject to and without limiting the Governing Law and Forum Selection section, STUDENT expressly agrees that any claim or cause of action that arises from, relates to, or has connection with the Mobile App and/or Online course shall be adjudicated exclusively and finally by arbitration in Austin, Texas, administered by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Except as required by applicable law, STUDENT knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently, and irrevocably waives any right to appeal from the arbitration award, including but not limited to any appeal from any judgment entered on the arbitration award or any order based thereupon. STUDENT agrees that any claim or cause of action that is subjection to arbitration under the CONTRACT must be brought in his or her individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. STUDENT agrees that the arbitrator shall not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides this “Mandatory and Binding Arbitration” section is not enforceable or is invalid, then this section shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the CONTRACT will remain in full force and effect. ATTORNEY’S FEES. If ACEABLE takes action (by itself or through its representatives) to enforce any of the provisions of this CONTRACT, including collection of any amounts due hereunder, in addition to all sums to which it is entitled or any other relief, at law or in equity, ACEABLE shall be entitled to recover from STUDENT and STUDENT agrees to pay, reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and all costs of any litigation or other dispute resolution proceeding.</p>

STUDENT agrees that the arbitrator shall not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides this “Mandatory and Binding Arbitration” section is not enforceable or is invalid, then this section shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the CONTRACT will remain in full force and effect.
