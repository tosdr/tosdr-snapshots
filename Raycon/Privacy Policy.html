Non-personal information is information we may collect whenever you gain access to or browse our website, such as your IP address, device type, browser type, and operating system you use. Each time you visit our website, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information. Other non-personal information also includes “cookies” which may be used to provide you with tailored information.

<p>How do I withdraw my consent? <br>If after you opt-in to marketing and promotional communications, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at unsubscribe@rayconglobal.com or mailing us at:</p>
