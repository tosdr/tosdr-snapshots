<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") that governs how we, FrankerFaceZ ("FrankerFaceZ", "FFZ", "we", "our" or "us"), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of: (i) the website FrankerFaceZ.com, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a "Site"); and (ii) the FrankerFaceZ browser extension, and any other software application that we license (each individually, and collectively, the "App"). The Site and the App are individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Services". We do not ourselves host any of the Services – all hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below) – as further described in this Privacy Policy – is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US).</p>
<p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from https://frankerfacez.com/terms.</p>
<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>
<p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
<h3>Usage Data</h3>
<p>We may collect information how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
<h3>Tracking & Cookies Data</h3>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.</p>
<p>Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>
<p>Examples of Cookies we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session Cookies. We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.</li>
<li>Preference Cookies. We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.</li>
<li>Security Cookies. We use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Twitch Account Data</h3>
<p>To provide our Service to you, we collect some information from your user account on https://twitch.tv ("Twitch").</p>
<p>When signing into FrankerFaceZ via your Twitch account, or by using the FrankerFaceZ extension on Twitch, we collect the following data about your Twitch account, provided to us by Twitch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitch account user ID and user-name, used for tying your FFZ account to Twitch.</li>
<li>Twitch oauth token, for communicating with Twitch's API in the context of the user.</li>
<li>Email address associated with Twitch account, which can be used to opt into email notifications regarding your FrankerFaceZ account, or other FrankerFaceZ features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Socket Server Data</h3>
<p>When using the FrankerFaceZ extension on Twitch, a connection is made between your browser and FrankerFaceZ servers in order to provide your Twitch session the data needed for FrankerFaceZ to work.</p>
<p>When using the FrankerFaceZ extension on Twitch, the following data may be sent through the socket connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients are all assigned a random UUID to identify them. This value is not stored on the server. The client IDs are used to estimate the number of simultaneous users we have connected at any given time.</li>
<li>Clients send the username and Twitch ID of the logged in Twitch user when connecting. This information is needed for certain features of the FrankerFaceZ extension to work.</li>
<li>Clients communicate with our server the Twitch channels they are currently active on, so that they can receive relevant data about the channel from us.</li>
<li>When an error happens in the official FrankerFaceZ client, the error is reported to https://sentry.io ("Sentry"). Error reports can be disabled in settings. They include the error that happened, the page the user was viewing, the user's active settings, the user's active FFZ and Twitch experiments, and a series of recent activity logs that make it easier to understand what was happening when the error occurred. Optionally, users can decide to include their Twitch ID and username with error reports.</li>
</ul>
