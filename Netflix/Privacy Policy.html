If we have collected and are processing your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and later decide you no longer want to receive them, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off. </p></li><li><p><strong>Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix.</strong> Some third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing about Netflix content or the Netflix service by sending privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use deidentification technologies to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website. </p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing of the Netflix service using cookies and similar technologies. </strong>To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs collected for marketing of the Netflix service or Netflix content on third party service, please use the tools described in the “<a href="#cookies">Cookies and Internet Advertising</a>” section below.</p></li></ul><h3>Advertising Choices (Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plans)</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Behavioral Advertising Choices <br><br></strong>If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we can present you with Advertisements, including behavioral advertisements.

This section explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below “<a href="#choice">How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</a>”</p><h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, and Resettable Device Identifiers</h3><p>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server. </p><p>We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.</p><p>If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant, and for analytics and optimization purposes. </p><h3>Why Does Netflix Use These Technologies?</h3><p>We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.</p><p>We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened. </p><p>Netflix uses resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, and to operate our ad supported subscription plan (including delivering Advertisements to you).</p><p>To learn more about the types of cookies used by Netflix, please <a href="#cookie-preferences">click here</a>. </p><h3 id="choice"><span>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</span></h3><ul><li><p><strong>To exercise choice regarding cookies<br><br></strong>For more information about cookies set through our service and to exercise choices regarding cookies, <a href="#cookie-preferences">click here</a>. We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track" signals.</p></li><li><p><strong>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers</strong><br><br>To exercise choice regarding Netflix’s use of resettable device identifiers (for marketing the Netflix service or Netflix content, or as used in connection with an ad supported subscription plan), please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device settings). If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix (and Advertisements if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan) on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier. Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device. </p></li><li><p><strong>To exercise choice regarding other similar technologies<br><br></strong>In addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to these choices, if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan and want to exercise your choices for behavioral advertising on Netflix as part of such plan, please see “Advertising Choices (Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plans)” above.</p><h2><span class="underline"><strong>Section E: Other Important Privacy Disclosures</strong></span></h2><h3>Sharing Functionality in our Service</h3><p>You can use sharing functionality available in our service to disclose your personal information in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>certain portions of our service may give you options to share information by email, text message, and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and apps on your device; and</p></li><li><p>social plugins and similar technologies that allow you to share information.</p></li></ul><p>Social plugins and social applications are operated by third-party social networks, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies.

Under the CCPA, these activities may be considered “selling” or “sharing.” If you do not want us to sell or share personal information about you, you can learn how to make applicable choices by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link located in the footer of <a href="https://netflix.com">netflix.com</a> or by visiting <a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/dnsspi">netflix.com/dnsspi</a>. Using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” (as defined by the CCPA) personal information, or stop all behavioral advertising. <br><br>We do not knowingly sell or share (as defined by the CCPA) the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. <br><br>Some web browsers and extensions are compatible with <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> (GPC), allowing them to communicate your preference to opt out from specific forms of data processing, including any “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.

It is possible that some may interpret an ad supported subscription plan to fall within the meaning of a “financial incentive” for the purposes of the CCPA.</p><p>If you choose an ad supported subscription plan, you will receive a discount in the price of your monthly subscription and when you watch shows and movies on Netflix, you will be presented Advertisements which may appear before, during, or after content viewed on Netflix. In certain circumstances some Netflix content and features (such as downloading and viewing Netflix content in other countries) may not be accessible under an ad supported subscription plan. </p><p>If you would like to stop subscribing to an ad supported subscription plan, you can access the “Account” section of our website and select a different plan. The monthly fee associated with your Netflix subscription will likely increase if you do so. We believe the reduction in the monthly fee for participation in an ad supported subscription plan and our use of the categories of personal information described above to present relevant Advertisements to you represents a fair exchange to continue to provide members a high quality service at a lower price to members. When considering the extent of reduction in monthly fee for participating in an ad supported subscription plan, we considered projected ad revenue generated by all members projected to participate in an ad supported subscription plan and the overall revenue required by Netflix to operate and innovate its business, produce the Netflix content to entertain its members, and make a profit.</p><h3>Personal Information Rights under US State Privacy Laws</h3><p>This section applies to residents of US States outside of California that have adopted US State Privacy Laws. </p><h3>Sale and Use of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes </h3><p>We may use certain categories of personal information to offer members an ad supported subscription plan or engage in marketing activities as described above in this Privacy Statement.
