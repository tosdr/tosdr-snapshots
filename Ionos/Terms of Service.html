                        2. TERM AND TERMINATION.
                    </h3><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.1.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be for an initial term of one month and shall be automatically renewed each month for additional one month periods unless and until sooner terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2. IONOS may accept prepayment for services to be provided under this Agreement, but such acceptance shall not modify or extend the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, IONOS offers certain Hosting and other Packages for which the term of this Agreement shall be in excess of one month (the &quot;Extended Term Packages&quot;), at the end of which this Agreement shall automatically renew for additional terms of equal length unless you turn off the auto renew function in your account, in which case this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the then-current term. You will receive notice between 30 and 60 days prior to the end of each term of your Extended Term Package that will alert you that your term is about to renew and will provide you with instructions on how to cancel if you do not wish to renew. These notices will be provided via your Customer Control Panel in the Message Board. Any and all service fees for the Extended Term Packages are NON-REFUNDABLE AND ARE DUE AND PAYABLE UPFRONT IN ADVANCE for the entire term thereof. Should you choose to terminate your Extended Term Package prior to the end its term you will not be entitled to a refund. For the purposes of this provision, any modification of the hosting package may, in the discretion of IONOS, be deemed a termination. Fees paid for an Extended Term Package shall be refunded to you if this Agreement is terminated by IONOS without cause pursuant to Section 2.2. prior to the end of the term of your Extended Term Package in an amount equal to the service fees for the remainder of the term on a prorated basis, or as otherwise agreed to in writing by IONOS in its sole discretion. Further notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, IONOS offers certain Packages for which the initial term of this Agreement shall be in excess of one month and shall have minimum term requirements (the &quot;Minimum Term Contract Packages&quot;), at the end of which such initial term this Agreement shall renew automatically on a month-to-month basis pursuant to the terms herein. Any and all service fees for the Minimum Term Contract Packages are due and payable for the entire initial term thereof. Should you choose to terminate your Minimum Term Contract Package prior to the end of its term you authorize IONOS to charge the Payment Account for all such fees and charges for the remainder of such initial term. For the purposes of this Section, any modification of the server package may, in the discretion of IONOS, be deemed a termination and entitle IONOS to the Fees owing on the Minimum Term Contract Package.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.2</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided herein, you or IONOS may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason, with or without cause, upon thirty days' written notice. You may terminate your account via the control panel or by notice to IONOS as set forth in Section 18.2. Should you terminate via e-mail, you must send the termination notice using the e-mail address which you provided to IONOS upon registration or subsequent thereto, in order to ensure the authenticity of the cancellation.IONOS may suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement and cease transmission of data associated with Your Web Site immediately and without notice:</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.2.1</strong>.&nbsp;if IONOS, in its sole discretion, deems that you have breached any part of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any warranty or obligation set forth in Section 8,</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.2.2.</strong>&nbsp;if your Payment Account provider refuses payment of fees or charges or you refuse authorization for same, or</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.2.3.</strong>&nbsp;if payment for the IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services is more than fifteen days overdue.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Payment Account provider, directly or through third-party service providers, may provide IONOS with updated credit card numbers, expiration dates, or other information which may be used to renew services or make payments under this Agreement. Should IONOS choose, in its sole discretion, to participate in such auto-update programs, you agree that IONOS may share your Payment Account information with such third-party providers and may update Your Payment Account with information provided through such services. You authorize any and all charges to your Payment Account using such updated information, whether or not you or IONOS have prior notice of same. IONOS cannot guarantee that your Payment Account will be updated, and you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to keep your payment information current and up-to-date at all times and that you shall be liable to IONOS for your failure to do so, including for any charges that IONOS may incur as a result of your failure to keep your payment information current. IONOS shall have no liability for declined payments or incomplete or out-of-date Payment Account information.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>2.4</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;After termination, you will no longer have access to your account and Your Data, including but not limited to e-mails, log files, databases, or other data files associated with your account may be deleted.

To get your mail space increased please contact the IONOS Technical Support.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Domain Name Registration</strong></p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.1&nbsp;</strong>Should you choose to register a domain name through IONOS, IONOS will register a second level domain name on your behalf, provided such domain name is available for registration. IONOS acts only as an intermediary between you and the organization providing the domain name, and has no influence over the assignment of domain names. The registration of your domain name is subject to the terms and conditions of those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ionos.com/terms-gtc/domain/" target="_blank" class="link-standard button-icon-before external-action-icon">registry terms and conditions</a>, and is also subject to the terms of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (<a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" class="link-standard button-icon-before external-action-icon">&quot;UDRP&quot;</a>). You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions of the UDRP in effect at the time of the dispute. IONOS assumes no liability in the event the domain name is unavailable or otherwise not assigned to you, and does not warrant or guarantee that assigned domain names do not infringe the rights of third parties, or that you will retain the rights to that domain name for any period of time. Upon payment in full of any and all registration fees, IONOS shall not own or otherwise legally control any domain name registered on your behalf. You agree that you are responsible for any and all fees and costs related to the registration of your domain name, and you authorize IONOS to debit the Payment Account for any such fees and costs. You acknowledge and agree that in the event of termination or expiration of a domain name, IONOS shall be the Designated Agent, commencing from the effective date of termination/expiration. Unless terminated, at the end of each term your domain name shall automatically renew for an additional term and you further authorize IONOS to debit your Payment Account for the renewal fee associated with such renewal term and any related fees or charges. Should the Payment Account provider fail to honor such renewal fee, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, release, cancel, or otherwise dispose of or utilize your domain name as it sees fit, with no obligation to you whatsoever. If a domain is terminated, IONOS may delete the domain registration forty (40) days after effective date of such domain name termination. Additionally, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, assign the domain name to another party for any and all purposes.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.2.</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that IONOS or its agents, assignees or licensees may associate any data of any kind, in IONOS’s sole discretion, with the Domain Name registered in association with Your Web Site or any URL incorporating said Domain Name until you replace such data with Your Web Site, at such times as Your Web Site is no longer available, and upon termination for any reason, for as long as IONOS or IONOS’s agent, assignee or licensee continue to be listed as the hosting entity with the domain name registry used to register such Domain Name. This paragraph shall apply to any and all web pages generated by IONOS or its affiliates, including but not limited to 404 error pages.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.3.&nbsp;</strong>The Customer agrees and accepts that, for reasons of security and/or in accordance with ICANN and other registry policies, IONOS shall set domain locks under certain circumstances, including but not limited to domain name registrations, domain name transfers, and any Material Changes to domain name owner details.&nbsp; The Customer will nevertheless be able to remove the transfer lock in order to allow a transfer of a domain name which has been applied for by third parties.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.4.&nbsp;</strong>You represent and warrant that your domain name does not infringe the copyright, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights of any person or company and that your domain name is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this agreement, in particular the provisions of Section 8.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.5.&nbsp;</strong>You shall inform IONOS of any claim or potential claim against your domain name, including but not limited to the initiation of a dispute under the UDRP, within five days of notification of same. Should you lose your right to use a domain name which is used in connection with the IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services, whether through expiration of the domain name, judicial decree, administrative decisions of the UDRP or otherwise, you agree to inform IONOS immediately of the party to whom the domain name is to be transferred and you authorize IONOS to take any and all action necessary to effect such transfer.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.6.&nbsp;</strong>IONOS will accept the transfer of domain names from other registrars, provided however, that you will be required to pay for an initial year of registration fees upon transfer. Domain names which have been prepaid for a period of more than one year but with fewer than nine years remaining may also be transferred, subject to the payment of an initial year of registration fees. An additional year will be added on to the remaining term of any transferred domain. Domain names with more than nine years remaining on the registration period may not be transferred. Upon the expiration of the one-year extension you will be charged an annual renewal fee for any subsequent renewal period. By requesting the transfer of your domain name you authorize IONOS to debit your Payment Account for the one-year registration fee and any related fees or charges.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.7.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that in the event a Material Change in respect of a domain name owner is required for any reason, any responsibility and liability for such Material Changes shall be borne solely by the Customer and account owner as the Designated Agent.&nbsp; The full ICANN Transfer Policy is available here.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.8.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that IONOS reserves the right to act as Designated Agent (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&amp;C) with respect to any Material Change (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&amp;C) or update to the domain name owner for any reason, without any liability to the domain name owner. &nbsp;The full ICANN Transfer Policy is available on the ICANN website.&nbsp;</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.9.&nbsp;</strong>The Private Domain Registration Services offered by IONOS are subject to the terms and conditions of IONOS’s Private Registration Service (the &quot;T&amp;C Private Domain Registration&quot;), which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.10.&nbsp;</strong>In using our Privacy Service, you agree to opt out of the 60-day transfer lock normally applied following any Material Change (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&amp;C).</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.11.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that IONOS may suspend, cancel, transfer or modify your domain name registration at any time, for any reason, at the IONOS’s sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel, transfer or modify a domain name registration:</p><p class="content-paragraph">1. to correct mistakes made by IONOS, another registrar, or the applicable registry administrator,</p><p class="content-paragraph">2. to resolve a dispute related to that domain name,</p><p class="content-paragraph">3. within five (5) calendar days of the creation date of that domain name registration,</p><p class="content-paragraph">4. if you breach this Agreement (including any applicable additional rule or policy),</p><p class="content-paragraph">5. if you use a domain name in connection with unlawful activity.</p><p class="content-paragraph">6. if IONOS believes, in its sole discretion, that the domain name has been registered fraudulently</p><p class="content-paragraph">7. upon receipt of a court order or other notification from a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitration award, or other legal authority requiring the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.<br /><br /> You further acknowledge and agree that your domain name registration is subject to suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification pursuant to the terms of any rules or policies applicable to your domain name registration, including, but not limited to (i) the UDRP, (ii) any ICANN adopted policy, (iii) any registrar (including IONOS) or registry administrator procedures, or (iv) any other ccTLD registry administrator procedures. As more completely set forth in Sections 6, 7, and 10, you waive any and all claims you may have, now and forever, against IONOS relating to the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.12.&nbsp;</strong>You shall have the right to cancel your contract in the event that the initial domain name registration price is greater than the price originally listed by IONOS. For the purposes of clarity, this termination right is only in relation to the new gTLDs and only under the above circumstances.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.13.&nbsp;</strong>You agree, and acknowledge, that some TLDs will have non-uniform renewal registration pricing such that the Fee for a domain name registration renewal may differ from other domain names in the same or other TLDs.<br /> You can review IONOS’s current renewal fees on the IONOS website.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.14.&nbsp;</strong>By ordering or applying SSL Certificates in connection with our products. You acknowledge and agree to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digicert.com/master-services-agreement" title="Verknüpfung folgen" target="_blank" class="link-standard button-icon-before external-action-icon" rel="nofollow noopener">Digicert Terms and Conditions</a>&nbsp;set forth on the IONOS website.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.2.15.</strong> In the case of a tariff with unlimited SSL certificates, the customer receives an SSL Wildcard certificate for each domain for which he has a current contract with IONOS, the SSL Wildcard certificate can be used for all domains administered by IONOS; if the customer concludes a new contract which includes a domain with IONOS another SSL Wildcard certificate will automatically be assigned.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.3</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Software</strong></p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>3.3.1.&nbsp;</strong>IONOS may, in its sole discretion, provide you with IONOS Software in combination with Your Services.

                        4. FEES
                    </h3><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.1.&nbsp;</strong>Certain IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services are subject to set-up, service, and domain service fees, pursuant to the Fee Schedule, and by registering for such IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services you authorize IONOS to debit your Payment Account for any and all such fees.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.2.&nbsp;</strong>The Fee is due in accordance with the terms of your contract, in advance of the provision of services, not later than the first of the month they are due. In the event that IONOS determines that the services of a collection agency are necessary or appropriate to collect amounts due under this paragraph, which determination shall be made in IONOS’s sole and unfettered discretion, any and all collection agency fees and other costs of collection shall be added to any amounts due under this provision.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.3.&nbsp;</strong>All Fees must be paid in United States Dollars in advance of the provision of services. IONOS will charge the Fees (including without limitation the monthly Fee, Fees for Extended Term Packages, and Fees for Minimum Term Packages), and any additional fees to the Payment Account unless specifically provided otherwise. You also agree that IONOS may automatically debit your Payment Account, without further authorization from you, for any renewal term, additional services, and any fees, taxes, or expenses applicable to Your Services or Your Website, including but not limited to sales, value-added, excise, use, or other taxes and any fees to fees for excessive bandwidth use or other surcharges for services in excess of those included within Your Services or Your Web Site. If payment in full is not received by IONOS from the provider of your Payment Account or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due from you for Your Services upon demand by IONOS.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.4.&nbsp;</strong>IONOS may offer subsequent promotional rates or special offers, the terms of which may or may not be more favorable than the terms and conditions for Your Services. Any such promotions or modifications shall not effect your obligations under this Agreement. Promotional fees may be subject to additional terms and conditions which, to the extent they conflict with the terms of this Agreement, shall govern. Promotional fees and special offers may not be combined.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.5.&nbsp;</strong>To the extent Your Services are subject to the terms and conditions of IONOS’s Money Back Guarantee (the &quot;T&amp;C Money Back Guarantee&quot;), they are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.6.&nbsp;</strong>IONOS offers a service uptime guarantee for the IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services, which provides for a credit to You in the event the total availability of IONOS hosted web pages falls below 99.99% (&quot;Uptime&quot;). If You can demonstrate to IONOS’s satisfaction, in IONOS’s sole discretion, that IONOS has failed to maintain the Uptime, You may contact IONOS and request a credit for that month proportional to the amount of downtime, to be put towards the purchase of future IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services. Credits cannot be redeemed for cash, and are exclusive of any applicable taxes. The credit does not apply to service interruptions caused by (i) periodic scheduled maintenance or repairs undertaken by IONOS from time to time; (ii) downtime caused by You; (iii) outages that do not limit browser access to Your web site (for example, interruptions to your ftp service or e-mail); (iv) suspension of Your account due to legal action taken or threatened against You or Your Services; (v) suspension of Your account due violations of the GT&amp;C, as determined in IONOS’s sole discretion, including but not limited to excessive use of system resources, non-payment or other billing issues, or identification by the abuse team as fraudulent or otherwise in violation of the GT&amp;C; or (vi) causes beyond the control of IONOS or that are not reasonably foreseeable by IONOS.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.7.&nbsp;</strong>You shall pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, in the event any invoice requires collection efforts. All accounts referred to a collection agency shall be subject to an additional fee of $18.95, which must be paid in full before the account is reactivated.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.8.&nbsp;</strong>International Customers bear the risk of currency fluctuations and any fees or taxes associated with the conversation of foreign currencies into United States Dollars. Certain IONOS&nbsp;Inc. Services will not be available to International Customers until IONOS is able to receive satisfactory confirmation from such customer's Payment Account provider, in IONOS’s sole discretion, that the funds will be available for debit from the International Customer's account. Orders from International Customers will not be accepted unless the country provided in the contact information matches that on file for the Payment Account.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>4.9.&nbsp;</strong>Upon cancellation of this Agreement you will receive a prorated refund of any pre-paid, refundable fees for the remainder of any term. Fees for certain services, including but not limited to domain name registration and maintenance, set up fees, shipping and handling, SSL certificate fees, Website Creator Plus, Website Builder Plus, in2site Live Dialog Plus, DynamicSiteCreator Plus, Additional Virus Scanner, Exchange accounts and fees for the Extended Term Packages, are not refundable except as may be provided otherwise herein or unless provided otherwise by applicable local law.
