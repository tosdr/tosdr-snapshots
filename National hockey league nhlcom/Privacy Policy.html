<p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Content providers</strong>, which may operate contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or public forums on our Services;</li>

</ul>

<p>Targeted Advertising: These and other third parties may collect and receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with advertising and other content) across your devices, including, for example, to make predictions about your preferences and deliver targeted advertising to you, both on and off our Services.

<p>Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising, please see the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices" >Your Other Privacy Choices</a> section below.</p>

<p>Social Networking Services: The third-party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services depending on your settings. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services.</p>

<p>You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from such third-party service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

Please note that if you have signed up to receive our marketing emails you will still receive emails that may be tailored to your engagement with the NHL, but they may be less relevant to you.

<p>7. <strong>Security &amp; Retention</strong></p>

<p>We have adopted physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to help protect against theft, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information we collect and receive. However, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information, or any other disclosures out of our control.</p>

<p>Your online access to some of your information may be protected with a password that you select. We strongly recommend that you select a unique password that is difficult to guess and that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls, or email messages).</p>

<p>We retain personal information for only as long as we need it to provide the Services, for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, after which we take steps to delete or anonymize information. Among the criteria used to determine our retention periods include the length of your relationship with us, any retention periods that are mandated by law, and whether retention is required pursuant to litigation or regulatory investigations.</p>

<p>8. <strong>Children's Privacy.</strong></p>

<p>Our Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 or as otherwise defined by local law without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") or other applicable local law.</p>

<p>9. <strong>Third Party Links.</strong></p>

<p>Our Services may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. Also, links to our Services may be featured on third party services on which we advertise. We provide links to third-party services as a convenience to our users. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked services. The linked services should have separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such services, and therefore we take no responsibility and assume no liability for the manner in which the entities that operate such linked services may collect, use, disclose, secure, or otherwise treat your information.</p>

<p>10. <strong>Additional California Disclosures</strong></p>

<p>This section provides certain disclosures intended to address California law requirements. We have tried to explain our privacy practices in full in the other sections of this Privacy Policy, but the disclosures in this section should be read to supplement those other sections with disclosures designed to conform to specific state law requirements.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy provides information about the categories of personal information that we have collected and disclosed or otherwise made accessible to third parties during the preceding 12 months. This information includes, for example:</p>

<p><em>Identifiers, such as your name, address, phone number, zip code, IP address, and online identifiers.</em> We may use this information to respond to your questions, to enable you to participate in our programs (including sweepstakes or contests), to process your registration with our Services, and for other business purposes.</p>

<p><em>Commercial information, such as a record of your purchases and services you have obtained.</em> We may use this information to improve your experience with our Services, to serve you ads about products and offers, and for other business purposes.</p>

<p><em>Internet and electronic network activity information, such as information about your interactions with our Services.</em> We may use this information to improve our Services, to better understand the visitors who come to our Services and the content of interest to them, and for other business purposes.</p>

<p><em>Geolocation data.</em> We may use this information to improve the quality, security, and relevance of our Services and for other business purposes.</p>

<p><em>Inferences about you, including about your preferences and characteristics.</em> We may use this information to provide our Services to you in an individual and personalized way and to send you marketing we believe may interest you, and for other business purposes.</p>

<p>Some of this information also is considered personal information under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.80.</p>

<p><strong>Additional California Rights</strong></p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices" >Your Other Privacy Choices</a> section for information on how to request access, deletion, or correction of your personal information and how to opt-out of certain disclosures of your personal information. In addition to the methods outlined in that section, if you are a California resident, you can also exercise your rights to know, correct, and delete personal information by calling 1-833-977-2095.</p>

<p>Please see the Your Other Privacy Choices section for information on how to request to opt out of the sale/sharing of personal information. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of children under the age of 16 without affirmative consent.</p>

<p>In addition to those rights outlined in the Your Other Privacy Choices section, California residents may also opt out of having their personally identifiable information shared with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes by contacting us as set out in the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#contact" >Contact Us</a> section below.</p>

<p>In addition, California residents who are registered users of the Services and are under the age of 18 are entitled, in accordance with California law, to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post as user content on the Services. You may request such removal by filling out the following form: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us" >NHL.com/contact</a>. Please select the "Privacy" option in the subject line and include in the body of the email (i) a statement that you are requesting, in accordance with California law, the removal of user content; (ii) a description of the material you want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; and (iii) your first name, last name, email address, mailing address (including city, state, and zip) and year of birth so that we can process your request. Please note that your request does not ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of the material.</p>

<p>11. <strong>Further Information for visitors outside of the United States, including European Economic Area ("EEA"), Canada and China Residents.</strong></p>

<p>International Transfers of Personal Information</p>

<p>The NHL's headquarters is in the United States, and, regardless of where you use our Services or otherwise provide information to us, your information may be transferred to, maintained, and processed by the NHL, its affiliates, and our operational partners and service providers in the United States or other locations outside of your jurisdiction of residence. Please note that U.S. privacy laws, regulations, and standards may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence and such information may be subject to lawful access by U.S. courts, law enforcement, and governmental authorities. Please be aware that information we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected, transferred, stored, and processed outside of your jurisdiction (which includes, for residents of Quebec, outside of Quebec) including in the United States or another country in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>Legal Basis for Processing for EEA Residents</p>

<p>To the extent our activities are subject to international data protection laws that specify limited legal grounds to process your information, the legal bases for our processing activities are to perform our contract(s) with you; to meet our legal obligations; and for our legitimate business purposes, including to improve our operations and Services, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our Terms of Service. We rely on your consent to send you direct marketing messages about our products, services and promotions and to deliver targeted advertisements to you, both on and off the Services. If you do not provide certain information to us, we may, in some circumstances, be unable to comply with our obligations or provide you with the services that you request. We will tell you about the implications of not providing certain information.</p>

<p>EEA Privacy Rights</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices" >Your Other Privacy Choices</a> section for more information on how to withdraw your consent at any time and your data protection rights. In addition, you may lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law. Contact details for all EEA Supervisory Authorities can be found <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080" >here</a>. You may exercise these rights by contacting us as provided in the Contact Us section below.</p>

<p>Information for China Residents</p>

<p>In order to achieve the purposes described in the “How We Use the Information We Collect and Receive” section of this Privacy Policy, we may transfer your personal information to NHL headquarters and affiliates or other third parties outside of China.</p>

<p>If your personal information is transferred to such parties, we will use lawful cross-border transfer mechanisms to transfer your personal information and adopt necessary measures to ensure that such overseas recipients can provide the same level of protection as required under applicable Chinese laws.</p>
