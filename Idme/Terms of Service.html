<h1>2. Service Definition</h1>
<p>The Service we Provide. The ID.me Service provides users with a simple and secure way to remotely verify their identities and affiliations (e.g., veterans, first responders, and members of other designated groups) once, and then share their identity and associated attributes at their discretion with parties that rely on these verifications. ID.me protects a user’s identity while simultaneously providing a level of assurance to businesses and government agencies (each a “Relying Party”) that the user’s identity, and attributes associated with that identity, are verified, based upon widely-recognized standards. The assurance provided by the Service allows both the user and the Relying Party to confidently complete transactions in a secure digital environment. In addition, ID.me provides its registered users (“Members”) with access to certain exclusive benefits, including without limitation, deals, discounts, cash back rebates and employment and educational opportunities, offered by participating retailers, service providers, employers, benefits administrators, and municipal, state and federal government agencies. Additional benefits and discounts may be offered to eligible parties, including our nation’s veterans, first responders, and members of other designated groups. To verify whether you qualify to receive these discounts and benefits, you will be required to provide us with certain personally identifiable information as described in our Privacy Policy. By providing us with this information, you understand, agree, and authorize us to use such information to verify your eligibility, which shall include, but not be limited to, sharing such information with (i) certain third party entities who are capable of helping us verify your identity or affiliations, (ii) Relying Parties that wish to offer certain access privileges to you upon the receipt of your explicit consent, and (iii) otherwise as detailed in our Privacy Policy. Before ID.me provides a third party with your information, you will be asked to authorize this release. This process is further described in our Privacy Policy. You may revoke subsequent access to this information by ID.me or by any Relying Party at any time by accessing your account settings.<p>

<p>ID.me also offers a service that allows its Members to earn cash back on qualifying online purchases made on the websites of participating retailers, service providers, employers or benefits administrators (the “Merchant Partners”) through its cash back rebates program (the “Cash Back Loyalty Program”). ID.me is not responsible for the products or services offered by our Merchant Partners. ID.me is responsible only for establishing and maintaining your account based upon the information you provide, posting the purchase information provided by the Merchant Partners and compensating registered Members who request payment of Cash Back Rebates.<p>

<p>Prior to using the ID.me Service, you must indicate that you understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. From time to time, (e.g., when we are validating your ID.me account, when we are re-confirming or re-validating the information in your account, and/or when you are renewing your registration with ID.me or its Services), we may, request that you reaffirm your understanding and agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. How do we do this? ID.me maintains an account for you that contains your identity and group affiliation information. Before you are able to use your account, ID.me must first verify your identity through a process called identity proofing. As part of the identity proofing process, you must provide us with various forms of information such as your name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, street address, email address, telephone number, financial account number and other personal information. The extent of the information needed is determined by the ‘strength’ of the validation process you choose or need from our service.<p>

<p>ID.me provides both ‘Unsupervised’ identity proofing, where you can sign-up online from a personal computer or mobile device, and a ‘Supervised (in-person)’ identity proofing, where you can present yourself and your identity evidence to an individual also known as a “Trusted Referee” who is authorized to review your information and help you through the process of validating your information. If we have problems with the identity proofing process, we may ask for further information to help us establish your identity and, in some cases, we may refer Unsupervised applicants to a Trusted Referee, so that they may complete the process in-person. In either case, our identity proofing process meets or exceeds industry best practices and applicable established standards. When we review your forms of identity evidence we may use special technologies to validate the documents you submit, and we may also use third parties recognized as authoritative sources (such as DMVs or credit bureaus) to corroborate the evidence. In addition, to make it easier for you to enter your address, ID.me uses Google Maps APIs. By using the ID.me Service, you are agreeing that you are bound to the Google Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy. ID.me’s Credential Policy gives further details of how we accomplish our identity proofing. In addition, ID.me’s Privacy Policy gives you details of how we protect the personal information you provide to us. Once we have completed our verifications, we will validate your ID.me account you will be able to use your ID.me account to provide a level of “proof” or assurance to another party of your identity or affiliation without having to provide these other parties with the more extensive information that you have provided Id.me for the identity proofing process. As further outlined in our Privacy Policy, ID.me will not provide your personal information to a third party without your express consent.<p>

<p>Your Obligations. By using the ID.me Service, you expressly agree that:</p>
<ol>
	<li>your identity, as established by the information and documents that you submit, matches the identity you claim while using the ID.me Service</li>
	<li>all information provided by you is complete and correct; </li>
	<li>you are affiliated with the groups that you attach to your ID.me account;  and</li>
	<li>any product discounts, cash rebates, deals, employment and educational opportunities (collectively, “Discounts”) are intended for the Member’s personal use.  Reselling, transferring, or exporting any discounted products and/or Discounts for the Member’s financial gain is strictly prohibited.	</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that Members may only use their ID.me account to verify their own identity, and any use by a party other than the Member, to verify the Members identity or to receive any benefits or Discounts, will be considered a material misrepresentation. ID.me , in its sole discretion, may immediately revoke a Member’s ID.me account upon learning of a violation of any terms contained herein, including, but not limited to inappropriate use of a Member’s ID.me account, and reserves the right to seek all other available remedies, in law or in equity.</p>

<p>You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to ID.me or its service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. See our Privacy Policy to see how we treat your data.</p>

<h1>19. Resolution of Disputes – Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h1>


<p>ID.me offers the following process to help you resolve a complaint or Dispute (as defined below) that you may have with ID.me, any services offered via the Website or Service, or use of the Website or Service. Please read this section carefully. Our Customer Service Department, which you can reach at help.id.me, Step 1. Notice of Dispute You must first try to resolve any complaint or Dispute with us through our Notice of Dispute process. You begin by submitting a “Notice of Dispute” with any supporting documents or other information by U.S. Mail to: ID.me, Inc. Attn: Dispute Resolution Department 8280 Greensboro Drive, Suite 800 McLean, VA 22102 A “Notice of Dispute” is a written form in which you provide your name, address, contact information, email address, the facts regarding your Dispute, and the relief you are requesting from us. Once we receive your Notice of Dispute, you and we will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within forty-five (45) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is received by us. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or we may initiate an arbitration proceeding or small claims action as described below. You agree that the term “Dispute” in this Agreement will have the broadest meaning possible. It applies to any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and us relating to the Website or the Service, any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of the Website or Service, communications between us, the purchase/order/use of goods or services from the Website, or the Agreement embodied by the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy – whether in contract, warranty, tort, laws or regulation. The term also applies to any dispute over the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration provision. Step 2. Arbitration If your Dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 45 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you and we agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us. As we explain below, you and we also may also have the right to bring an individual action before a Small Claims Court for certain claims. You agree that arbitration or a small claims action will be your sole and exclusive remedy to resolve any dispute with us. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement. By agreeing to arbitrate, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) any and all Disputes in a court before a judge or jury (except Small Claims Court). Instead, a neutral arbitrator will resolve all Disputes. JAMS/Endispute, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor thereof (“JAMS”) will administer the arbitration using the JAMS’ procedures and rules in effect on the date the Arbitration is filed (“JAMS Rules”). In the event the JAMS Rules are inconsistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, this Agreement will prevail. JAMS is independent from us, and you may obtain copies of the current JAMS Rules, and other related materials, including forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614 or by visiting <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Class Action Waiver Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your Dispute with other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity or as a private attorney general are not permitted and are waived by you, and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims. If a court or arbitrator finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect. Costs If you initiate an arbitration with JAMS, we will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee you may have been required to pay by JAMS, once you have notified us in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration demand. However, if we are the prevailing party in the arbitration, we will be entitled to seek and recover our attorneys’ fees and costs, subject to the arbitrator’s determination and applicable law. Small Claims Option You may also litigate any Dispute in the District of Columbia, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. However, if you initiate a Small Claims case, you are responsible for all your court costs. Choice of Law and Forum Selection You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware govern this agreement and any claim or Dispute or issues arising from it, without regard to Delaware’s conflict of laws rules. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or Dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any Disputes or claims that you may have against us reside in and will be resolved by a state or federal court located in Northern Virginia and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.</p>
