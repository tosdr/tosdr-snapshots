    <a href="#section-eight">8. Data Retention</a>
</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information will be retained until we have fulfilled our legal, contractual and policy obligations.</strong> ID.me stores your Personal Information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law and contractual obligations). This means we may retain your Personal Information even after you close your account with us, for up to three (3) years. Users may request that ID.me delete certain Personal Information at any time at account.ID.me or through our <a href="https://account.id.me/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Rights Center</a>, where applicable. We acknowledge all such requests, however we reserve the right to retain data tied to certain high-risk transactions, particularly in government and healthcare settings, exclusively for fraud prevention and government audit purposes.</p>

<p>ID.me aligns to the National Archives recommended guidelines for data retention when supporting government agencies. Personal Information provided by users in connection with a public sector agency as part of their verification may be retained for up to three (3) years after account closure, unless applicable regulations require a shorter retention period.</p>

<p><strong>Selfie Image and Associated Biometric Information.</strong> Certain pieces of Personal Information, such as a selfie image and the associated Biometric Information submitted by users for certain types of verification Services, are retained in line with ID.me's obligations to our partners, with the specific retention periods determined by the first partner with whom a user first verifies their identity (e.g., IRS, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, etc.) Certain partners may require this information to be purged within twenty-four (24) hours following a successful verification, other partners may require a longer retention period, but under no circumstances will ID.me retain this information for longer than thirty-six (36) months absent a subpoena, warrant, or other legally compelling justification.</p>

<p>While we store your Personal Information, we use approved industry-recognized encryption methods to protect it from unauthorized access. Likewise, when we destroy your Personal Information, we use industry-recognized methods to affect such destruction.</p>
