<p>The downloads from our website are cached by Fastly, a CDN provider. This may
also log your IP address - see <a href="https://www.fastly.com/privacy">Fastly’s privacy policy</a> for details.
We don’t currently use this data at all, but we may use it for aggregated
statistics in the future.</p>

<h2 id="codebase">Codebase</h2>

<p>The Foreman community use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> to manage the code that
comprises the Foreman project. Refer to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">GitHub’s privacy policy</a> for
details on how GitHub handles the data you post there.</p>

<p>Commit messages can contain names and email addresses. You are free to use
psuedonymous data for commit messages. We do prefer a working contact mail in
case of needing to contact contributors to the codebase, but it is not
mandatory.</p>

<p>We also use non-identifiable data from the codebase to provide aggregated
statistics such as average time to merge, number of open pull requests, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent</li>
</ul>

<p>The Foreman community also runs a self-hosted bug tracker using the
<a href="https://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a> software. When you sign up for a Redmine
account, you provide us with an email address and a name.</p>

<p>Externally, we only use this email within Redmine to contact you about bugs you
have reported or subscribed to. You have full control over what emails are sent
from your Redmine account preferences.</p>

<p>Email addresses can also be linked to GitHub commits (see above) if the emails
match, or manually by an admin (on request). This enables Redmine to
automatically attribute issue changes to your user, based on the public commit
data from the GitHub repositories (e.g. closing it when you fix an issue). This
populates your Redmine “activity” page, which is public.</p>

<p>The bug tracker also uses cookies to store your session.</p>

<p>We also use the bug tracker data to provide aggregated statistics such as
number of open/closed bugs, average time to close a bug, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>The Foreman project maintains two public IRC channels on
<a href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a>, refer to <a href="https://libera.chat/privacy">libera.chat’s privacy
policy</a> for details on how they handle your data.</p>

<p>The Foreman community uses a self-hosted forum using the
<a href="https://discourse.org">Discourse</a> software. When signing up for a Discourse
account, you provide a name and email address - and in addition we store the IP
address of your most recent connection. The email address is only used to send
you updates to your forum topics, personal messages from other users, and
digest summaries. You have full control over the emails sent from your
Discourse account preferences. The forum also uses cookies to store your
session.</p>

<p>We also use the IP addresses and <em>public</em> post data to provide aggregated
statistics about the forum community, such as posts-per-month, user engagement,
etc. We also use the IP addresses to help identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)">sock
puppeting</a> and spam
accounts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="surveys">Surveys</h2>

<p>The Foreman community runs a survey each year. Completing the survey is opt-in,
and providing a contact email address in the survey is <em>optional</em>. Such
addresses are stored until the survey analysis is complete, and then deleted
from the raw survey data before publication. The survey data is used to gain
understanding of the community, and aggregated statistics based on the survey
results are published each year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="foreman-debug-archives">Foreman debug archives</h2>

<p>The Foreman project provides a tool called <a href="https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/blob/develop/script/foreman-debug">foreman-debug</a> which
collects logs from your Foreman server and uploads it to a secure location in
our infrastructure. Use of this tool is entirely voluntary (it is never run
automatically), and the data is used by our developers to assist users in
debugging complex problems. The data is not used for any analysis or
statistics, is only accessible to a small number of the Foreman developers, and
is deleted regularly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal basis for this data usage: Consent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="your-choices">Your choices</h2>

<h3 id="you-can-choose-not-to-provide-us-with-personal-data">You can choose not to provide us with personal data</h3>

<p>Using a VPN, Tor, or other IP / UserAgent masking service will not affect your
use of the project website, as it is entirely static. For Redmine &amp; Discourse,
we do not mandate use of real names, and using pseudonyms will not affect the
services.</p>

<h3 id="your-accounts-on-our-services">Your accounts on our services</h3>

sent to you. 3rd party services such as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> retain
their own policies and privacy options.</p>

  <li>Git commits will not be rewritten
    <ul>
      <li>contributing to the codebase is opt-in,</li>
      <li>providing personally identifying information in commit messages is a further opt-in</li>
      <li>we have a legitimate interest in contacting contributors and showing IP provenance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
