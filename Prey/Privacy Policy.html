We are transparent in the gathering and processing of your personal data. Consequently, we have decided to adhere the highest standard of privacy by complying with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and making those rights available to all of our users so you can know that both your devices and your data are safe with us.  </p><p>We will NEVER request unnecessary information unless it is necessary to provide a better service.  </p><p>We will NEVER sell your personal information or data from your devices to a third party. </p><p>We will NEVER enable the functionalities of our software without your prior consent or request. By adding a device to your account, location tracking is set to ON by default. You can change this at any time on your settings. </p><p>We will NEVER access your personal information or data from your devices without your prior consent and will do so solely for support purposes. </p><p>If you have any concerns about how we protect and process your data, please do not hesitate to contact us at <strong>privacy [at] preyhq [dot] com</strong>.</p><p> </p><h4>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT      </h4><p>We only request the minimum amount of data to create your account, this includes your name and country; however, it is important to highlight that the only way for us to identify you as a user is through the e-mail you used to register, which will be the official channel of communication between us. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the basis for us processing personal data is the provision of a service.    </p><p>Once the software is installed on your device the default settings for location awareness is “on”, this mean that your devices will send all location changes to our servers. You can set this option to “off” in which case we won’t ever get the location information of your devices unless they are set to missing or you specifically request it. Once a device is set to “missing” you can start receiving reports and have the camera take pictures, this option can be turned off in the report settings. A device marked as ‘missing’ sends technical identification data to our servers along with the geo-localization, images and files you decide to retrieve from it.   </p><p>‍</p><h4>NEWSLETTERS </h4><p>Currently, we have two mailing lists, one for updates from our Blog with security and technology news and another one of commercial information for clients.
