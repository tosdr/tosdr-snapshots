      SOFTWARE BEHAVIOR
      <ol class="legal-list">
        <li>
          Scheduled Tasks. By installing desktop software or mobile apps produced by RealDefense you acknowledge that the products may create and run scheduled tasks on your device. Scheduled tasks are enabled by default. You can disable most scheduled tasks at any time from within the product settings. If you wish to disable ALL scheduled tasks you need to uninstall the software completely. Payment is not required to disable, enable, or amend the scheduled tasks created by any one of the RealDefense Products.
        </li>
        <li>
          Background Processes. Upon installation, RealDefense Products may set and run tasks or background processes on your computer that will auto-start upon reboot or restart of your computer's operating system. These tasks are required to check your installed software for available updates, validate your license information, monitor your computer for specific product-related items (such as privacy threats, malware infection attempts, etc.) and various other product-related tasks required for the products to operate. If you do not wish to grant the products that permission, please uninstall the products at your convenience or disable the ‘Launch at System Startup' option from within the product settings where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          URL Redirects/Blocked Websites. When installed, RealDefense Products may detect certain website and/or software communication attempts as malicious and block any outgoing or incoming communication between your computer and the specific website and/or IP address. This communication block is done for your safety. If you do not wish to grant the product(s) that permission, please uninstall the Product(s) at your convenience or disable the ‘Safe Browsing' feature from within the product settings where applicable. If you wish to visit/allow the blocked URL after all, please add the URL to the exclusion list of your security software.
        </li>
        <li>
          User Account Control/UAC. UAC is a security feature of Windows which helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system by prompting the user for manual approval. Certain RealDefense Products may disable the UAC prompts relating only to those RealDefense Products. At any point you can uninstall the product if you feel this is an inconvenience to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Installing Multiple Software Products. Please note that installing multiple security products and/or utilities with overlapping coverage on devices that are not designed for high performance is not recommended, nor needed.

From time to time, a new software patch or newly deployed version of such third party product may be released that is incompatible with our products. We cannot guarantee that our Products will work after installation of such incompatible products.

          You acknowledge that arbitration is a substitute for litigation, and that you agree to present any dispute to the arbitrator and not a governmental agency, body, or court.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at support@realdefen.se within thirty days of first registering your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of this Agreement that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
        </li>
        <li>
          The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Los Angeles, California, or any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section XV will be deemed void.

      MISCELLANEOUS
      <ol class="legal-list">
        <li>
          This Agreement is governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. You and RealDefense agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Products will be brought in the federal or state courts of Los Angeles County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions above. Both you and RealDefense consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
        </li>
        <li>
          This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and RealDefense with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or other terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. These Agreement creates no third-party beneficiary rights. You acknowledge that any adjustment or amendment to this Agreement must be in writing, signed by you and an authorized employee of RealDefense.
        </li>
        <li>
          RealDefense's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. Our rights under this Agreement survive any transfer or termination of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. RealDefense may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any part of this Agreement is held or found to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to be consistent with applicable law while the remaining portions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.
