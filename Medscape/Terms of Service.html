You will always be able to view the most current version of these Terms by clicking on the Terms of Use link at the bottom of any page of a Medscape Network property. Note that these Terms do not apply to our properties and services that display a link to different terms of use. In the event that we expand the Medscape Network through our acquisition of another company and/or its properties, that company may operate its properties subject to its own terms of use accessible via a link on such properties until we integrate its practices with ours, at which point a link to these Terms will be displayed on its properties. <strong>By using the Services, you agree to these Terms, whether or not you are a registered member of the Medscape Network. These Terms govern your use of the Services and create a binding legal agreement that we may enforce against you in the event of a violation. If you do not agree to all of these Terms of Use, do not use the Services!</strong></p>
