            <p><em>Effective November 5, 2015</em></p>
<p>SocialSign.in, Inc. ("SocialSign.in") is pleased to offer you fast, high-quality, wireless access to the Internet and access to personalized offers and promotions (the "Services"). We make the Services available to you through a variety of Internet-enabled devices, including computers, tablets, smart phones, and personal Internet devices (collectively, "Devices").

<p>We provide our Services to you subject to the following Terms of Use, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. By accessing and using the Website or the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use and the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, this "Agreement"). You also acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by any additional terms and conditions and/or privacy policy that participating Venues (as defined below) may impose, for which SocialSign.in is not responsible. In such case, you will be provided with such additional terms and conditions and/ or privacy policy and will be required to accept them in order to access and use the Services.

<h5>1. DESCRIPTION AND USE OF SERVICES</h5>
<ol type="a">

Your Device will connect automatically with the Services wherever they are available with our participating Venues. </li>
<li>b. As described in our Privacy Policy, we will use Geolocational Information from your Device to offer you wireless Internet access as soon as you're within range of and connected to one of our or our Venues' networks, and to help advertisers and retailers bring you relevant offers and promotions that you can use at that Venue.</li>
</ol>
<h5>2. RESTRICTIONS</h5>

<h5>3. COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h5>
<p>Our community, like any community, functions best when its users follow a few simple rules. By accessing and/or using the Website or the Services, you hereby agree to comply with these community guidelines the ("Guidelines") and that:</p>

<p>SocialSign.in respects the intellectual property rights of others and attempts to comply with all relevant laws. We will review all claims of copyright infringement received and remove any content deemed to have been posted or distributed in violation of any such laws.</p>
<p>Our designated agent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act") for the receipt of any Notification of Claimed Infringement which may be given under that Act is as follows:</p>
<p>SocialSign.in, Inc. <br />
Attention: DMCA 1407<br />Broadway, 24th Floor<br />
New York, NY 10018</p>
<p>If you believe that your work has been copied on the Website or via the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our agent with notice in accordance with the requirements of the Act, including: (i) a description of the copyrighted work that has been infringed and the specific location where such work is located; (ii) a description of the location of the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work; (iii) your address, telephone number and e-mail address; (iv) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; (v) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and (vi) an electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.</p>
<h5>12. MISCELLANEOUS</h5>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of law provisions. You expressly agree: (i) to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of New York; and (ii) that the Website and the Services shall be deemed passive that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over SocialSign.in, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York.

<p>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.

Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement, including Schedule A, constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.</p>
<p>Copyright 2015 SocialSign.in, Inc. All rights reserved.</p>
<h5>Schedule A - SocialSign.in's Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP")</h5>
<p>SocialSign.in respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information, however, when there are competing interests at issue, SocialSign.in reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, SocialSign.in has developed this AUP, which supplements and explains certain terms in the Agreement and is intended as a guide to your rights and obligations when utilizing the Services and the Website. This AUP will be revised from time to time, without any obligation to notify you of the same. Your use of the Services after changes to this AUP are posted on the Website shall constitute your acceptance of any new or additional terms.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use the Internet, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others. When you obtain information through the Internet via the Services, you must keep in mind that we cannot, and do not make any attempt to, monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that you may acquire. For this reason, you must exercise your best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet is sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because we cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, neither SocialSign.in nor any applicable Venue shall be responsible for injury to you that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal Internet communications.</p>
<p>When you disseminate information through the Internet via the Services, you must keep in mind that SocialSign.in does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information you may create. When you place information on the Internet, you have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Also, because the information you create is carried over our and the Venues' networks and may reach a large number of people, your postings may affect other subscribers and may harm our goodwill, business reputation, and operations. For these reasons, you violate this AUP and the Agreement when you engage in or facilitate the following prohibited activities:</p>
<h5>1. Intellectual Property Violations</h5>
<p>Using the Services to engage in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, or privacy or publicity rights held by individuals, corporations, or other entities. We are required by law to remove or block access to user content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement. It is also our policy to terminate the privileges of users who violate copyright laws.</p>
<h5>2. Obscene Speech or Materials</h5>
<p>Using the Services to view, advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material. We are required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when we become aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through the Services.</p>
<h5>3. Defamatory or Abusive Language</h5>
<p>Using the Services as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.</p>
<h5>4. Spamming</h5>
<p>Using the Services to send unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet (known as "spamming"). Spamming is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward SocialSign.in, but also because it can overload our and the Venues' networks and disrupt service to our other users. When a complaint is received, we have the discretion to determine from all of the evidence whether the email recipients were from an "opt-in" email list.</p>
<h5>5. Forging of Headers</h5>
<p>Using the Services to forge or misrepresent message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.</p>
<h5>6. Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks</h5>
<p>Using the Services to access illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual's system (often known as "hacking"). Also, any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e. port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity).</p>
<h5>7. Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities.</h5>
<p>Using the Services to distribute information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks.</p>
<h5>8. Export Control Violations.</h5>
<p>Using the Services to export encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States.</p>
<h5>9. Other Activities.</h5>
<p>Using the Services to engage in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that SocialSign.in determines to be harmful to our or the Venues' subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with you. We will not monitor the communications of our users to ensure that they comply with the Agreement, this AUP, or applicable law. However, if we become aware of harmful activities, we may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a website, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet or a particular website, or taking any other action that we deem appropriate.</p>
<p>We are also concerned with the privacy of on-line communications and websites. In general, the Internet is neither more nor less secure than other means of communication, including mail, facsimile, and voice telephone service, all of which can be intercepted and otherwise compromised. As a matter of prudence, however, we urge you to assume that all of your on-line communications are insecure. We cannot take any responsibility for the security of information transmitted over our or the Venues' networks, equipment, or facilities.</p>
<p>We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying your obligations as responsible members of the Internet. Any complaints about a user's violation of this AUP should be sent to <a href="mailto:support@socialsign.in">support@socialsign.in</a></p>
