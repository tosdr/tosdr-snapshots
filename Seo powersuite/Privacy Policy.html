    <h1>SEO POWERSUITE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    Effective Date: May 11, 2021
    <br><br>
    When you use SEO PowerSuite or any of the products included therein (all together and each individually called
    "<strong>SEO PowerSuite</strong>") or our website <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/"
        target="_blank">https://www.link-assistant.com/</a> and https://www.seopowersuite.com (and other available
    domains such as .fr, .de, .nl, .jp, .es, .ru.) ("<strong>Website</strong>") we can collect some of your
    <strong>Personal Data</strong> (which means information about you, which can directly or indirectly identify you).
    <br><br>
    We take the privacy and security of your Personal Data very seriously. We do not sell your Personal Data and do not
    earn money from your Personal Data in any other way. Our goal is to provide you with SEO tools while respecting your
    privacy and obligations. Our business model is simple: we only make money if you choose to pay for our tools by
    purchasing a license. This means that great products and services are our main assets and keeping your data private
    is one of our operating principles.
    <br><br>
    We take numerous measures to protect your Personal Data from accidental loss or theft.
    <br><br>
    This Privacy Policy describes: <br>
    · How we process your Personal Data, including using cookies, <br>
    · With whom we can share your Personal Data, and<br>
    · The choices you have regarding your Personal Data.

    updated Privacy Policy will be subject to the new Privacy Policy. If we make any major changes to our Privacy Policy
    and will need your explicit consent for further processing of your Personal Data, we will request your consent or
    your renewed consent (in case it was obtained previously).
