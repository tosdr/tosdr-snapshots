                (together, the “Restricted Jurisdictions”).

                Astrill may, in its sole discretion, implement controls to restrict access to its Services or website in any of the Restricted Jurisdictions.

You can use Astrill account on five physical devices at the same time unless otherwise stated in your active plan. Astrill may enforce you to authorize devices which are allowed to connect to VPN services through a special member-zone control panel and set a maximum limit of authorized devices greater or equal to the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for your account. Astrill VPN can not be used on 2 or more routers at the same time, just one connected router per account is allowed.</li>
              <li>Astrill Personal VPN is for personal use only. If you wish to use Astrill for business purposes, you must have our Business Solution. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@astrill.com">support@astrill.com</a> for more details.</li>

              <li>VIP add-on gives access to Astrill VIP VPN Server Network. Traffic used on these servers is counted and your usage of these servers is limited to the amount of traffic you purchase with your VIP add-on. Traffic packages are counted per calendar month and counters reset every 1st day of month at midnight GMT. When you purchase new VIP add-on or you upgrade your traffic quota other day than the 1st of every month, the available traffic for the month of purchase will be reduced accordingly. That is if you buy 100GB / month package on 28th January, you will get only 4/31 * 100 GB of VIP traffic allowed in the rest of January. Similarly if your membership ends on the 1st of June, you can only use 1/30th of your current VIP traffic quota package.</li>
              <li>Some product features advertised on our website (such as but not limited to Smart Mode) and certain protocols may be unavailable in your country. For complete details about availability of individual features please ask our support. By purchasing Astrill membership you agree that some features / protocols / devices supported may be limited without prior notice. Such change of available services is not a valid reason for full nor partial refund.</li>
              <li>Any rewards in form of affiliate commission, free membership or other special rewards will be granted only if the invited user and inviting user are different entities and do not share the same devices and the memberships are not paid for by the same entity. Reseller and affiliate commission are mutually exclusive.</li>
              <li>Use of services in a datacenter, for any purpose, if not explicitly allowed by Astrill is not allowed.</li>
