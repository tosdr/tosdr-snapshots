<p><strong>14. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND THEREFORE AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW CLAIMS YOU AND ODA HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>14.1     Effect of Agreement to Arbitration Terms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By agreeing to the Terms, and unless you opt out as provided immediately</strong><strong> below, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against ODA on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Section 14, “Agreement to Arbitrate” (hereinafter “Arbitration Terms”). By agreeing to the Arbitration Terms both you and ODA waive the right to resolve any such disputes through a trial by jury or judge or through an administrative proceeding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your agreement to the Arbitration Terms will preclude you from bringing any</strong><strong> class, collective or representative action against ODA, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated or representative action brought against ODA by someone else. This means the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. However, you and ODA each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>14.2     Right to Opt Out of Arbitration Terms. </strong>You may opt out of these Arbitration Terms and your agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor ODA can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. You may opt out by emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@movate.com">legal@movate.com</a> or sending us written notification at OnDemand Answers, Inc., Attention: Legal, 75 E. Santa Clara Street, Suite 900, San Jose, CA 95113. You must notify us by emailing or posting within thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision, and your notification must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your account (if you have one) and a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Arbitration Terms. Your decision to opt out of these Arbitration Terms will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us. Unless you choose to opt out, this dispute resolution provision in <em><u>Section 14</u> </em>shall survive termination of the Terms.</p>
<p><strong>14.3</strong>     <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial. </strong>The parties hereby waive their constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under these arbitration section terms. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and ODA (or the applicable Customer) in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, you and ODA (or the applicable Customer) waive all rights to a jury trial, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p><strong>14.4     Waiver of </strong><strong>Class or Consolidated Actions. </strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and ODA are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and ODA otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated or representative proceeding. All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Terms must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one User cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other user or third party (including but not limited to Experts, users or Customers).</p>
<p><strong>14.5     Notices. </strong>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief. A Notice to ODA should be sent to: OnDemand Answers, Inc., Attention: Legal, 75 E. Santa Clara Street, Suite 900, San Jose, CA, 95113. Any Notice to the applicable Customer should be sent to that Customer’s principal offices. After the Notice is received, you and ODA (or the applicable Customer) may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and ODA (or the applicable Customer) do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled. If you opt out of these Arbitration Terms, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>14.6     Arbitration Terms. </strong>To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise between you and ODA, both you and ODA mutually agree that pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1-16, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will submit solely to final, binding and confidential arbitration any and all disputes, claims or causes of action arising from or relating to: (i) the negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance, breach or enforcement of the Terms; or (ii) your work with ODA and your ODA Account (including but not limited to all statutory claims); or (iii) the termination of your relationship with ODA and any ODA Account on the Services (including but not limited to all statutory claims); provided, however, that this Section shall not apply to any claim or cause of action brought in court by you pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 as amended. The arbitration will be initiated through and conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) pursuant to<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><em> </em></a><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><em>JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures</em></a> that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by these Terms. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will mutually select an alternative provider (“ADR Provider”). The Terms and the rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms (“Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearing. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that ODA or the applicable Customer made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, ODA (or the applicable Customer) will pay you the greater of the award or 130% of the settlement offer. ODA will pay any portion of the other party’s arbitration costs in excess of those that you would have paid were the dispute brought in court.</p>
<p><strong>14.7     Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. </strong>If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>14.8     Time Limits. </strong>If you or ODA (or the applicable Customer) pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the Arbitration Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
<p><strong>14.9     Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator shall have the sole and exclusive authority to determine whether a dispute, claim or cause of action is subject to arbitration under this <em><u>Section 14</u> </em>and to determine any procedural questions which grow out of such disputes, claims or causes of action and bear on their final disposition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim; shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the ADR Provider’s rules and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and ODA (or the applicable Customer).</p>
<p><strong>14.10   Severability. </strong>If any provision of these Arbitration Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Arbitration Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>14.11   Right to Waive. </strong>Any and all of the rights and limitations set forth in this section may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these terms.</p>
<p><strong>14.12   Survival of Terms. </strong>The Arbitration Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with ODA (or the applicable Customer).</p>
<p><strong>14.13   Small Claims Court. </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or ODA (or the Applicable Customer) may bring an individual action in small claims court in Collin County, Texas, United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>14.14   Emergency Equitable Relief. </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Terms.</p>
<p><strong>14.15   Courts. </strong>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Terms permit the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Collin County, Texas for such purpose.</p>
<p><strong>15. General</strong></p>
<p><strong>15.1     Changes to Terms. </strong>These Terms are subject to revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we will notify you by sending you an email to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Services so it is visible when you visit and/or log-on to the Services for the first time after the change is posted. Such changes will not retroactively modify agreed dispute resolution provisions for any then-pending disputes. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been posted shall constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must cease your use of the Services. Any changes to these Terms will be effective immediately following our posting of notice of the changes on our Services. You are responsible for providing us with your most current email address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.</p>
<p><strong>15.2     Electronic Communications. </strong>The communications between you and us use electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send emails, or whether we post notices on the Services or communicate with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
<p><strong>15.3     Entire Agreement. </strong>These Terms (which include any other rules posted on the Services) constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation.” If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. We may freely assign these Terms. The terms of these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.</p>
<p><strong>15.4     System Outages and Changes to Services. </strong>You acknowledge and agree there will be occasions when the Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are outside of our control, and that we will have no liability for your inability to access and/or use the Services, or any portion thereof, during any of the foregoing events. We reserve the right to change, alter or vary the Services or Services offered on or through the Services at any time without notice.</p>
<p><strong>15.5     Third-Party Beneficiary. </strong>ODA and you acknowledge and agree that each Customer is a third-party beneficiary of these Terms, and that, upon you accepting the terms and conditions of these Terms, each such Customer will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>
