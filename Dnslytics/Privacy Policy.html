<h1 id="data-collected-by-our-browser-addons-extensions-and-apps">Data collected by our browser addons, extensions and apps</h1>
<p><strong>Data collected</strong></p>
<p>Our browser addons, extensions and apps (hereafter called &ldquo;addon&rdquo;) do not embed any kind of tracking or analytic code. All the information displayed by the addon is collected by our service. The addon sends a request to our service for information. Your IP address, internet browser and timestamp will be logged for every request. We only use this information to protect our service for abuse. These logs are removed after 180 days. Depending on the function of the addon this request may include the hostname part of the current URL. The first time we detect a new hostname it will be added to our database of hostnames and used to deliver our tools and services. Collected hostname data is always stored without any user context or reference to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements</strong></p>
<p>Ads may be displayed inside our addon. Ads consists of text links or images hosted on our own server. We do not use any cookie, iframe or other techniques to track users. By clicking on an advertisement you are redirected to a third-party website. This privacy policy does not apply to these websites and we cannot control there activities.</p>
<h1 id="data-collected-to-provide-our-products-and-services">Data collected to provide our products and services</h1>
<p>All data we collect and process is publicly available on the internet. We can not collect protected data and we do not bypass any security measures. Below we describe the data we collect and the measures we are taking to minimize the collection and use of personal data.</p>
<p><strong>DNS, Domain and server IP data</strong></p>
<p>For our DNS investigation services we collect several DNS, domain names and server IP records. This data is for example used to track spammers or hackers, detect potentially fraudulent transactions, identify malicious websites and to protect intellectual property. To collect domain names we use the official published zone files, hostnames collected by our addons and public sources like commoncrawl.org. To collect DNS and server IP records we use a technique called active DNS. Active DNS means our system queries the DNS server to collect the data. We do not use any user input or user logs. By using the active DNS technique all data is collected and stored without any user context or reference to personally identifiable information. The data we collect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A, AAAA, MX, NS and SPF records for every domain name.</li>
<li>A and AAAA records for every mail (MX record) and name server (NS record).</li>
<li>A and AAAA records for every subdomain.</li>
<li>PTR records of the complete IPv4 address space and limited set of IPv6 addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Website data</strong></p>
<p>Our service crawls all active domains and subdomains. The following pages are crawled: homepage, maximum of five direct linked pages, ads.txt and robots.txt files. We extract and collect technical and meta data from it. The data we collect are: name and version of the webserver, HTTP headers, HTML meta tags, Google Tags, technology frameworks used, script and CSS files used. We use this data to generate reports, for example a report of domains using a certain webserver.</p>
<p>For our HTML search engine all crawled data is stored and indexed. Historical data is removed within 180 days from our servers.</p>
<p><strong>Whois data</strong></p>
<p>On our service whois data is displayed. Whois data may contain personal data. Starting from 25 May 2018 most domain registrars removed the personal data of EU companies and individuals. The whois data is shown for the sole purpose of assisting our users in obtaining information about domain name or IP address registration records and for no other purpose. We only serve this data to the user who made the request. For performance reasons we cache this data for a limited time. After the cache has expired the whois data is deleted from our systems. We have implemented the following measures to protect against misuse of the whois data:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not offer bulk access to whois data.</li>
<li>We do not offer any services based on whois data like whois history or reverse whois.</li>
<li>Whois data is excluded from search engine crawlers.</li>
</ul>
