<p>2.6 If in the opinion of Webdevmedia the continued functioning of the computer systems or network of Webdevmedia or third parties is actually or under threat of being damaged or jeopardized, for example through excessive transmission of e-mail or other data, leaks of personal data or virus/hacking activity, Webdevmedia may take all steps it deems reasonably necessary to end or avert such damage or jeopardy.</p>
