<p>2.3 You may not send automated requests of any sort to DNSlytics. You may not use a proxy service or any other service when using DNSlytics to hide your real IP address. Automated requests are available through the DNSlytics API Service and subject to additional terms and conditions.</p>
<p>2.4 All information (such as reports or output of tools) that you download, receive, or otherwise obtain through DNSlytics may be used solely for informational, personal, non-commercial purposes.

<p>2.6 If in the opinion of Webdevmedia the continued functioning of the computer systems or network of Webdevmedia or third parties is actually or under threat of being damaged or jeopardized, for example through excessive transmission of e-mail or other data, leaks of personal data or virus/hacking activity, Webdevmedia may take all steps it deems reasonably necessary to end or avert such damage or jeopardy.</p>
<p>2.7 Webdevmedia is at all times entitled to file a criminal complaint for any offenses committed through or using the service.
