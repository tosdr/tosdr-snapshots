    <h5>a. Services and/or Product Data </h5>
    <p>
        We may collect and record information relating to the setup, general performance, and operation of the Services
        and/or Product, including Services and/or Product status, User Content that a Services and/or Product’s sensors

        about the device our user is on such as their Operating System, and browser, as well as the city, region and
        country location of users. This location information enables DJG to send public health push notification
        messages that are relevant to certain geographic locations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push
        notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App. </p>

    <p>INFORMATION DISCLOSED FOR A BUSINESS PURPOSE</p>
    <p>We have disclosed, within the preceding twelve months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy, and do
        disclose Personal Information to other business or third parties for various business purposes. These purposes
        include, but are not limited to, fulfillment of orders and shipments, execution of marketing and advertising
        activities, execution of service requests from consumers, and execution of product safety notices and
        recalls.</p>
    <p>NO SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:</p>
    <p>As of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, We do not sell any consumer personal information to any third
        party. Any change in our position on the sale of consumer data will result in an update of this Privacy Policy
        and we will provide you with the opt-out and opt-in rights required by the CCPA.</p>
    <p><strong>NON-DISCRIMNATION:</strong></p>
    <p>We will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their rights under the California Consumer Privacy
        Act</p>
    <p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS AS A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request that we discloser to you the categories and
        specific pieces of information which we have collected about you in the preceding twelve months. We will honor
        such requests to the extent required by applicable law. As a resident of California, there are three categories
        of request which we support:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>'Data Subject Access Requests': you have the right to request that we disclose to you the categories of
            information and specific pieces of information which we have collected about you in the twelve months
            preceding your request, including the sources from which we have collected data, the third parties with whom
            we have shared personal information, and the business purposes for the collection and, to the extent
            applicable, sharing of information with third parties.
        </li>
        <li>Deletion of Personal Information ('Right to be Forgotten'): to the extent applicable by law, you have the
            right to request that we delete personal information about you that we have collected from you. Exceptions
            include where personal information is maintained for:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Transaction completion;</li>
            <li>Detection of security incidents or protection against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal
                activity;
            </li>
            <li>Debugging for identification and repair of functionality errors;</li>
            <li>Exercise of free speech;</li>
            <li>Compliance with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;</li>
            <li>Engaging in scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest;</li>
            <li>Internal uses reasonably aligned with consumer expectations;</li>
            <li>Compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
            <li>Otherwise lawful use, compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Data Portability Request: you have the right to obtain your personal information in a format that allows you
            to transmit it to another organization. We will deliver personal information as required by law within 45
            days after receipt of a verifiable request, unless we notify you, as required by law, that we require
            additional time to respond.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In all three cases, above, we will first, as required by law, verify the request.</p>
    <p><strong>HOW TO MAKE A REQUEST:</strong></p>

        the means listed below.</p>
    <h3><a id="10-data-transfer">10. DATA TRANSFER</a></h3>
    <p>You understand and agree that personal information provided in connection with the Services and/or Product may be
        transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which DJG or
        its Providers maintain facilities, including, without limitation, the United States of America and Canada, and
        you consent to the transfer of your personal information to such jurisdictions. In the event DJG or its assets
        are sold, merged or otherwise involved in a corporate transaction, DJG may transfer affected customer and
        personal information without your consent.</p>
    <h3><a id="11-privacy-issues">11. PRIVACY ISSUES</a></h3>
    <p>If you have questions concerning a privacy issue or wish to update, correct or modify your personal information
        or privacy preferences (such as to indicate you do not wish to receive promotional communications), you may
        contact DJG customer service using the contact information below.</p>
    <h3><a id="12-privacy-inquiries-complaints">12. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</a></h3>
    <p>If you believe that DJG has not complied with this online Privacy Policy with respect to your personal
        information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write to DJG at the contact address
        indicated below. In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the
        ways in which you believe that the DJG online Privacy Policy has not been followed. We will attempt to
        investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly. Please note that if you provide DJG with inconsistent privacy
        preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers
        and indicating on another occasion that they may not), DJG cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy
        preference will be honored. Also, please note that DJG is not responsible for the content or privacy practices
        of non-DJG websites to which this Site or any other DJG website may link. You should review the privacy policy
        of such sites before using the sites.</p>
    <h3><a id="13-force-majeure">13. FORCE MAJEURE</a></h3>
    <p>DJG and its Providers shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts or
        circumstances beyond their control, including without limitation acts of God, strikes or other labor disputes,
        riots, acts of war, malfunction of portions of the Internet or another third party network, governmental
        regulations promulgated after the effective date of these Terms of Use, communication line, power or equipment
        failures, fires or other disasters, and acts of third parties, including hackers (each a "Force Majeure
        Event").</p>
    <h3><a id="14-dispute-resolution">14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</a></h3>
    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND IT LIMITS THE
        MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. To the fullest extent permitted by law, these Terms of Use, and any claim,
        dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to these Terms or Use, the Services or
        Product, will be governed by the laws of Indiana, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflicts of laws
        principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted
        by law, any dispute or claim relating to this Privacy Policy, the Services and/or Product will be resolved by
        binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"),
        rather than in court (except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, and you or
        we may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to stop infringement or other misuse of intellectual
        property rights). The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the enforcement of this
        agreement to arbitrate. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION
        PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE
        ACTION. This arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
        state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. If for
        any reason a claim proceeds in court (other than small claims court) rather than in arbitration you and DJG each
        waive any right to a jury trial and irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
        Columbus, Indiana in connection with any such action. You and DJG waive any objection based on lack of personal
        jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue or forum non conveniens in any such action.</p>

        for use in all countries, and some or all of the features of the Services and/or Product may not work or be

        export laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions in providing and using the

        disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that
        such communications be in writing. </p>
    <h3><a id="17-continuity">17. CONTINUITY</a></h3>
    <p>Please note that if DJG sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or DJG (or a
        division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, DJG may provide to such entity customer
        and personal information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other
        entity without your consent.</p>
    <p>Specific elements of the Services and/or Product may include additional or different provisions relating to
        collection and disclosure of personal information. In the event of a conflict between such provisions and this
        Privacy Policy, such specific terms shall control.</p>
    <h3><a id="18-general">18. GENERAL</a></h3>
    <p>These Terms of Use, including any applicable Service Terms and other materials incorporated herein, represent the
        entire agreement and understanding relating to the use of the Services and prevail over any prior or
        contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications. The English version of this Privacy Policy shall
        govern over any translation. You acknowledge and agree that each of DJG’s Providers, as well as Apple, Google
        and other applicable OS providers, shall be considered a third party beneficiary of these Terms of Use and shall
        have the right to enforce this Privacy Policy directly against you in connection with any dispute or breach.</p>
    <p>Any unauthorized access, modification or change of any information, or any interference with the availability of
        or access to the Services is strictly prohibited. DJG reserves all legal rights and remedies available to it and
        this Privacy Policy shall in no way be deemed a limitation or waiver of any other rights DJG may have.</p>
    <p>Our failure to assert a right or insist upon compliance with any term or condition shall not constitute a waiver
        of that right or excuse any subsequent noncompliance. If any provision of this Privacy Policy is deemed
        unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the remaining
        terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The parties agree that
        any invalid provision shall be deemed to be restated so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible
        under law consistent with the original intent and economic terms of the invalid provision.</p>
