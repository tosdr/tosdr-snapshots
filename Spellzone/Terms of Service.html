<p dir="ltr">5.3.5. You are duly authorised to provide the Site usernames and passwords to teachers and students who are wholly connected to the Site for which a Fee has been made. This Fee will also enable teachers and students, who are wholly connected to the Site, to use the username and password at any other location if it is in connection with work set by the Site. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5.4. Single users</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">5.4.1. A Fee is payable by you for single user access to the Service. This Fee will also enable you to use the username and password at home and in any other location.</p>

<br/>
<strong>5.5. Family, home school and private tutor users</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>5.6. VAT</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">5.6.1. The Fees are exclusive of VAT which will be payable by you, if applicable and at the prevailing rate of VAT, in addition to the Fees as follows.</p>

If you validly exercise a right to cancel we will refund the Fee paid within 30 days.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="7" id="7"></a>7. Termination</h2>
<p dir="ltr">7.1. You can terminate the Service with us at any time by giving us notice in writing. Unless we are in breach of our obligations to you, you will not be entitled to any refund of the Fee paid by you. You may in addition be entitled to cancellation rights under Clause 6.</p>

<p dir="ltr">7.2.3. you fail to pay the Fee when due.</p>
<p dir="ltr">7.3. We reserve the right to terminate the Service at any time without giving you any reasons. If we terminate the Service under this clause we will refund a proportion of the Fee relating to the remainder of the period for which you have paid (if any). </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="8" id="8"></a>8. Personal Data</h2>
<p dir="ltr">8.1. We will request certain Personal Data from you (or if you are an institution, from your employees) in order to provide the Service to you. You are responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of such information and you warrant and undertake to us that all such information is true and correct.</p>
<p dir="ltr">8.2. We will use your Personal Data only for the purposes of providing the Service to you. We will treat your Personal Data as confidential and we will not disclose it to any third party except with your prior agreement or as required by law.

<p dir="ltr">8.3. We reserve the right to request supporting documentation to verify personal information at our absolute discretion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">8.4. You must notify us immediately of any change in your Personal Data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">8.5 Our use of Personal Data is set out in our <a href="privacy-policy.cfm">Privacy Policy</a> and our use of cookies is set out in our <a href="cookie-policy.cfm">Cookie Policy</a>. By using the Website, you are agreeing to the provisions set out in our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="9" id="9"></a>9. Usernames and Passwords</h2>
<p dir="ltr">9.1. You may access certain parts of the Website without registering or providing Spellzone with your details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">9.2. Where you have registered on the Website and have been provided with a username and password. You are NOT free to divulge these details to any third party, except as documented in this agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">9.3. If there has been a disclosure of your username and password, you agree to promptly notify us of such disclosure so that Spellzone can take appropriate security measures and instruct you how to create a new username and password.</p>
<p dir="ltr">9.4. If we reasonably believe that a user name and password are being used in any way which is not permitted by us we reserve the right to suspend the Service and/or issue a new username and password.</p>
<p dir="ltr">9.5. Spellzone recommends that you change your password at least on an annual basis. See <a href="password-guidance.cfm">password guidance</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="10" id="10"></a>10. Children's Privacy Guidelines</h2>
<p dir="ltr">10.1. Spellzone exists to serve educators, parents and students and strives to provide a safe, positive experience for children. We have audited our compliance with the Children’s Code and are pleased to say that Spellzone meets its requirements. To help ensure this, we adhere to the following policies:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
We request confirmation that a user is over the age of 18 before they sign up for a Spellzone free trial or subscription or that they have parental or guardian consent to do so. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
We do not distribute any personally identifiable information about children to third parties. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
We do not allow students to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
We try to avoid providing access links to any websites that request personal information, such as user email or physical addresses. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
We do not use the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to entice children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity. </li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="11" id="11"></a>11. Children and the risks of use of the Internet and the Website</h2>
<p dir="ltr">11.1. We are concerned about the safety and privacy of our users, particularly children. Any adult or organisation using Spellzone, suggesting the use of Spellzone for children and/or directing or assigning students to use Spellzone should be aware of the many risks of using the internet and take appropriate protective measures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">11.2. Some of these online risks include but are not limited to the possibility that students can be exposed to obscene or profane materials, that students might be directed through links to websites that try to solicit personally identifying information, that malicious computer viruses, code or other &quot;malware&quot; can attach itself to a user's computer through emails, downloads and website visits, and the possibility that any information transmitted across the internet cannot be guaranteed to be entirely private and secure. Although the services provided by Spellzone have measures in place for removing external links, malware and obscene or profane language they are provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">11.3. Teachers/parents who wish to allow their child(ren) access to and use of the Website/Service should consider supervision of such access and use. By allowing your child(ren) access to the Services you are allowing your child(ren) access to all of the Services. It is therefore your responsibility to determine which Services are appropriate for your child(ren). Always use caution when revealing personally identifiable information about yourself or your child(ren) via any of the Services.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="12" id="12"></a>12. The Service</h2>
<p dir="ltr">12.1. The contents of the Service are only for general information or use. They do not constitute advice and should not be relied upon in making (or refraining from making) any decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.2. We use reasonable care to make sure that the information appearing on the Service is accurate and up to date. However, errors and omissions can occur and you should not take the accuracy of the information for granted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3. Because we do not have control over the use that may be made of the information provided through the Service, we exclude (to the fullest extent permitted at law) all warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, accuracy, timeliness, completeness, performance, or fitness for a particular purpose of the Service or any of its contents. In particular we make no warranty or representation that:</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.1. the Service will meet your requirements;</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.2. the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free;</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.3. the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable;</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.4. the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the Service will meet your expectations;</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.5. the contents of the Service are free from infection by viruses or anything else which has contaminating or destructive properties; or</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.3.6. any errors in the software contained within the Service will be corrected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">12.4. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained by you through the use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and on the basis that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="13" id="13"></a>13. Service Access</h2>
<p dir="ltr">13.1. We endeavour to ensure that the Website is available 24 hours a day with at least 99.9% uptime in any calendar month.</p>
<p>If we do not meet 99.9% uptime, we will credit customer accounts with the equivalent amount of downtime, upon request. Downtime credits may not be exchanged for monetary amounts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">13.2. Downtime credits may not be issued for circumstances beyond our control such as failure of a transmission link.<br/>
See <a href="#22">Our Liability Clause 22.4</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="14" id="14"></a>14. Technical and Organisational Measures</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Spellzone Limited will adopt physical, technical, and organisational measures to ensure the security of Personal Data. This includes the prevention of loss or damage, unauthorised alteration, access or processing, and other risks to which it may be exposed by virtue of human action or the physical or natural environment. A summary of the Personal Data related security measures is provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
Prevent unauthorised persons from gaining access to data processing systems in which Personal Data are processed. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Prevent persons entitled to use a data processing system from accessing Personal Data beyond their needs and authorisations. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that Personal Data in the course of electronic transmission during transport cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorisation. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that access logs are in place to establish whether, and by whom, the Personal Data was entered into, modified on or removed from a data processing system. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that in the case where processing is carried out by a Data Processor, the data can be processed only in accordance with the instructions of the Data Controller. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that Personal Data is protected against undesired destruction or loss. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that Personal Data collected for different purposes can and is processed separately. </li>
<li dir="ltr">
Ensure that Personal Data is not kept longer than necessary </li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="15" id="15"></a>15. Changes to the Website</h2>
<p dir="ltr">15.1. The information on the Website may be incomplete, out of date or inaccurate, may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors and be subject to occasional 'downtime'. Spellzone reserves the right to update the Website at our sole discretion. Thus, such information may be changed, updated or removed without notice.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="16" id="16"></a>16. Material Submitted by Users</h2>
<p dir="ltr">16.1. Spellzone has taken a number of measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on the website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists. However, no protective measures can be fool-proof.</p>
<p dir="ltr">162. Spellzone provides spelling practice on the website where registered users can post word lists. We do not accept any responsibility for the content or accuracy of such material. Where the material is based on or contains extracts owned by third parties, we do not make any representation or warranty that the material is provided without infringing the rights of the third party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">16.3. To maximize privacy and security, we require users to set up accounts if they wish to post word lists or comments. <br/>
<p dir="ltr">16.4. Spellzone has no method for verifying whether someone who registers as a teacher at a particular school is truly that teacher or works at that school. It is therefore possible for a person to register and post while posing as a teacher or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. It is actually common on the internet for people to register using false information about themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">16.5. All Spellzone users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. When made aware of a fraudulent account, Spellzone will take measures to ban that user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">16.6. You agree that you will not upload files or content that contains software or other materials protected by intellectual property laws unless you own or control all of the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">16.7. You are not permitted to post or transmit to or from the Service any unlawful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material or any other material which could give rise to any civil or criminal liability. </p>
<p dir="ltr">16.8. You must not conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters or falsify any author attributions or other proprietary designations or do anything that might restrict or prohibit other users from using the Service.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness for Spellzone during this remote learning phase. The site is easy for students to navigate independently and they're really enjoying the activities and spelling games. You get an awful lot for your money with Spellzone. Really reassuring is the very prompt response with helpdesk queries. I've very rarely needed the helpdesk, but when I have, the issue has been addressed and sorted within a very short time."</p>
