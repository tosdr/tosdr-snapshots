<p dir="ltr">If you choose to accept our cookies, you can also delete such cookies later from your computer (see the 'Managing Cookies' section below). If you delete the cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and will need to be re-created when you visit the website subsequently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spellzone may also track certain information regarding your use of the website through the use of JavaScript code, web beacons and third party website analytics providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By using the website, you are agreeing to the provisions set out in this Cookie Policy.<br/>
</p>
<h2><a name="3" id="3"></a>What are Cookies?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises those cookies. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device. You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Cookies have various functions, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some cookies are allocated to your device only for the duration of your visit to a website, and these are called session based cookies. These cookies automatically expire when you close down your browser. Another type of cookie known as &quot;persistent&quot; cookies would remain on your device for a set period of time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, please note that some websites contain third party cookies i.e. cookies that are set by a third party domain.</p>
<h2><a name="4" id="4"></a>Categories of Cookies</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We have categorised the cookies used on the website as follows:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies some services, like e-billing, cannot be provided. Because these cookies are strictly necessary, we do not need to ask for your consent to use them. You may at any time restrict, disable or delete the cookies by adjusting your web browser settings. For more information, please see the 'Managing Cookies' section below. However, you may not be able to access some parts of the website, and some features may not function properly or be available to you.<br/>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Performance Cookies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often and how long they spend on the website, and whether they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve the performance of a website to enhance the users experience and to ensure that we develop the website to meet with their expectations. In addition, some of these cookies are analytics cookies, set using third party web analytics software, which allow us to understand more about how our website is used. For example, some websites use Google Analytics cookies to help the owners of those websites to monitor their website traffic but those cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor. The owners of those websites may also use such cookies to highlight products and/or services which they think will be of interest to you based on your use of their websites.
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">These cookies allow websites to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and to provide enhanced and more personal features. For example, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on websites other than the website you are visiting.<br/>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Third party cookies</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Some Spellzone website pages may use third party services or software, such as maps, online videos or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies on your device.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>By using our website, you are agreeing that Spellzone may place these types of cookies on your device.</strong></p>
<p>For details of the cookies which would be used, please see our Cookie Directory below.

<p> <strong>Google Adsense</strong> - a DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as Spellzone, displaying AdSense ads. When users visit such a website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to Spellzone and/or other sites on the Internet. </p>
<p>Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the ads preference manager.
