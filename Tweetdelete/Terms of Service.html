Depending on your needs, you may want to access more or all of TweetDelete.Net’s Services by creating or upgrading to a paid account (“Paid Account”). You can create or upgrade to a Paid Account by signing up for one of TweetDelete.Net's subscription plans (“Subscription Plans” and each a “Subscription”).
You can find information about our pricing options and available Subscription Plans on the following page here.
</p>
<b>Fees for Subscriptions</b>
<p> Fees for Subscriptions (“Subscription Fees”) shall be based on the length of your Subscription (“Subscription Period”). All Subscriptions will auto-renew at the end of the then Subscription Period.</p>
<p>We bill you for all initial and recurring Subscription Fees through an online billing account and you agree to provide (and keep updated) current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can process your payments and contact you as needed.
</p>
<p>Our prices may be updated from time to time so please make sure that you check our current Subscription Fees before placing your order. All payments shall be in USD.
</p>
<b>Accepted Forms of Payment</b>
<p>We accept the following forms of payment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visa</li>
  <li>Mastercard</li>
  <li>American Express</li>
  <li>Discover</li>
  <li>Any other Stripe supported card brands</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect for your Subscription, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your order. If your Subscription is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until you notify us of your cancellation in accordance with the cancellation information described in this section below.</p>
<b>Sales Tax</b>
<p>Sales tax will be added to the price of purchases as deemed required by us. Amounts due under these Terms of Use are payable to us without deduction and are net of any tax, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including without limitation any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value-added tax, whether or not withheld at the source (collectively, “Sales Tax”). Except as forbidden by applicable law, we may require that you submit applicable Sales Taxes to us. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that you are tax exempt, provided you give us a valid tax exemption certificate within thirty (30) days of the start of your Subscription. Our failure to include any applicable tax in an invoice will not waive or dismiss the parties’ rights or obligations pursuant to this Section. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of Sales Taxes or any other tax or duty, you shall separately pay us the withheld or deducted amount, over and above fees due. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section does not govern taxes based on our net income.
Account Upgrades, Downgrades, and Cancellations
</p>
<p>If you created a Free Account but want to upgrade to a Paid Account, your upgrade will occur immediately upon payment of the relevant Subscription Fees and your Subscription Period will run from the date of your upgrade.
If you created or upgraded to a Paid Account, and you want to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrade to a different Subscription Plan: Your upgrade will occur immediately at a prorated rate upon payment of the price difference between the two Subscription Plans for the remainder of your Subscription Period. Your upgraded Subscription Plan will run until the end of the initial Subscription Period and will auto-renew as the upgraded Subscription Plan.
</li>
  <li>Cancel your Subscription Plan and/or downgrade your Subscription: Your downgrade will take place following the end of your current Subscription Period.
</li>
</ul>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN YOU DOWNGRADE YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES AVAILABLE WITHIN YOUR NEW SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, AND THEREFORE YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO ANY ADDITIONAL FORMS OR ANY PREMIUM CONSENT PLATFORM FEATURES CREATED OR AVAILABLE THROUGH YOUR PREVIOUS SUBSCRIPTION PLAN.</p>
<b>How to Cancel a Subscription Plan</b>
<p>You can cancel your Subscription Plan at any time by logging into your account or contacting us using the contact information provided below. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current Subscription Period.
Except as stated in this Section, we will not be required to refund Subscription Fees under any circumstances.

<h5 id="dispute-resolution">19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5>
<b>Informal Negotiations
</b>
<p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ninety (90) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
</p>
<b>Binding Arbitration
</b>
<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association(&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules''), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the United States, Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

<p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States, Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<b>Restrictions</b>
<p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitratio</b>
<p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
