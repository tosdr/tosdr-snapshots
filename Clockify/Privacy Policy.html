        <p class="text-center"><strong>Last updated: July 10, 2023</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how CAKE.com Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates
          (“<strong>CAKE.com</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) collects, uses, and discloses
          information about you when you use our <a id="productLink" href="https://clockify.me/">Clockify</a>, <a
            id="productLink" href="https://pumble.com/">Pumble</a>, <a id="productLink" href="https://plaky.com/">Plaky</a> or
          <a id="productLink" href="https://marketplace.cake.com/">the
            Marketplace</a> websites, mobile applications, and add-ons, tools and other online products and services
          that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “<strong>Services</strong>”), engage with us on social
          media, or otherwise interact with us.</p>
        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the
          date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a
          statement to our website or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
          regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>
        <h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>The information we collect from you varies depending on our relationship with you, which Services you use,
          and the way in which you use them. When you simply browse our public website as a consumer
          ("<strong>Consumer</strong>") to explore our Services or to learn more about us, we do not request that you
          provide us your information. If you use our Services and become a CAKE.com business user who has licensed
          and/or purchased one of our products or Services or contact us to learn more about using our Services in
          connection with your business ("<strong>Business User</strong>"), we collect information from you as describe
          below. Our Services, even if free, are offered to Business Users and are only intended for commercial, not
          personal, use. Our Business Users may also collect and provide us information about their authorized users to
          whom they provide access to the Clockify, Pumble, or Plaky Services through their Business User account
          (<strong>“Authorized User”</strong>) or their clients or customers (<strong>“Business Clients”</strong>).
          Below, we describe the ways in which we may collect information in these different situations.</p>
        <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us.</p>
        <h4>Business Users</h4>
        <p>If you are a Business User, we collect certain personal information about you in order to facilitate our
          business relationship with you and provide you with our products and services.</p>
        <p>The Business User personal information we collect from you includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, account username and password, communications you provide, and
            any other information you choose to provide.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Professional information</strong>: work contact details, title, employer and job title.</li>
          <li><strong>Commercial information</strong>: purchase or subscription history and type, invoices, payment
            details where applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also collect information a Business User chooses to provide relating to its Business Clients. Business
          Users must provide their Business Clients any required notices and collect any necessary consents before
          providing or disclosing any such information to us. CAKE.com does not directly collect or control Business
          Client personal information, but rather the Business Users determine what Business Client personal information
          they collect, and to the extent CAKE.com receives that information, we do so on behalf of our Business Users.
        </p>
        <h4>Authorized Users</h4>
        <p>We collect information from Authorized Users of our Business Users. As an Authorized User, you share
          information directly with us when you create an account, use our Services, submit or post content through our
          Services, sign up for our newsletter, fill out a form, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request
          customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. However, while we may directly collect your personal
          information, we do so on behalf of your company, the Business User who provided you access to our Services,
          and not for our own purposes. CAKE.com does not directly control the processing of Authorized User personal
          information, but rather Business Users are responsible for providing their Authorized Users any required
          notices and collecting any necessary consents before requesting that we collect or disclose the personal
          information of their Authorized Users.</p>
        <p>The types of Authorized User personal information that we collect for Business Users depends on the Services
          selected, and directions and permissions given to us by the Business User, but could generally include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> your name, account username, user identification, and password,
            email, language, time zone, phone number, photograph, birthday, anniversary, personal API key, role on our
            Services, Skype number, chat correspondence on our Services, any communications you provide, and any other
            information you choose to provide.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional information</strong>: work contact details, title, employer, job title.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Clockify entries</strong>: event and project calendars, time entries, hourly rates, clients and
            projects, tasks and work assignments, expenses, time off requests, custom fields, screenshots, audit log,
            and any other information you wish to input.</li>
          <li><strong>Pumble entries</strong>: messages, files, user status.</li>
          <li><strong>Plaky entries</strong>: project groups and teams, tasks and their designated team members,
            comments, invitees, and files.</li>
          <li><strong>Auto Tracker tool information (Clockify only)</strong>: the applications, programs, and websites
            you access, and the time (both active and idle) that you spent on each. All data collected from the Auto
            Tracker will be stored on the Authorized User’s device for a limited time unless the such data is converted
            to a Clockify time entry. (See more information about the Auto Tracker tool <a
              href="https://clockify.me/help/time-tracking/auto-tracker">here</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Integration Tracker tool information (Clockify only)</strong>: when downloaded into a particular
            application, program or website, select content from such applicable application, program, or website and
            the time (both active and idle) that you spent on each. (See more information about the Integration Tracker
            tool <a href="https://clockify.me/integrations">here</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Desktop Screenshot tool information (Clockify only)</strong>: Authorized User desktop appshots
            taken in timed intervals and linked to a Clockify time entry. Authorized Users will receive a notification
            when screenshot capturing is enabled. (See more information about the Desktop Screenshot tool <a
              href="https://clockify.me/help/extra-features/screenshots">here</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Location Tracker tool information (Clockify only):</strong> in accordance with your device
            permissions, we may collect information about the precise location of your device. This feature enables the
            Business User to track who is currently working on-site and its Authorized User’s location history
            throughout the day while the timer is running. Location is recorded every time the timer is started and
            stopped in the mobile application. Locations are collected even if the mobile application works in the
            background. You may stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see the Your Choices
            section below for details). (See more information about the Location Tracker tool <a
              href="https://clockify.me/help/extra-features/gps-tracking">here</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Add-on interactions:</strong> Interactions you have while searching for, installing, disabling and
            uninstalling the marketplace add-on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not providing certain personal information may prevent CAKE.com from providing Services to you (e.g., without

        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), the United Kingdom, or
          Switzerland, and you are a Business User whose personal information we control, you have certain rights and

          you.</p>

            protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data
            analytics, and communicate with you).</li>
          <li> To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who
            have opted out of marketing communications).</li>
          <li> When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing communications from us).
            When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal information, you may withdraw such consent
            at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>We store your personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally
          collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other
          compliance obligations.</p>
        <p>For Authorized Users, we retain your personal information for the duration of our agreement with your
          company, or until your company requests its deletion, whichever comes first, unless it is required to meet our
          legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. Additionally, some information, including but not limited
          to screenshots, GPS location, auto-tracking, and audit-log information are automatically and routinely deleted
          after a designated time as part of our data retention policies.</p>
        <h3>Data Subject Requests</h3>
        <p>To the extent required under applicable law, you have the right of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Information</strong>. You have the right to be informed about how we collect and use your personal
            information.</li>
          <li><strong>Access.</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we are
            processing about you, which we will provide to you in electronic form.</li>
          <li><strong>Rectification.</strong> You have the right to require that any incomplete or inaccurate personal
            information that we process about you is amended.</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion</strong>. You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we
            process about you, unless, for example, we are required to retain such data in order to comply with a legal
            obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Restriction</strong>. You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your
            personal information where: (i) you believe such data to be inaccurate; (ii) our processing is unlawful; or
            (iii) we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, but where we are not able to delete
            the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.</li>
          <li><strong>Portability</strong>. You have the right to request that we transmit the personal information we
            hold with respect to you to another data controller.</li>
          <li><strong>Objection</strong>. Where the legal justification for our processing of your personal information
            is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your
            situation (e.g., direct marketing). We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate
            grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process
            the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.</li>
          <li><strong>Withdrawing Consent.</strong> If you have consented to our processing of your personal
            information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Please note that if
            you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our use and processing of your information
            on the basis of your consent before the point in time when you withdraw your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some rights may be limited, and we may need to retain certain personal information, as required or permitted
          by applicable law. If you would like to further inquire about, or exercise any of these rights, please contact
          us using the information below.</p>
        <p>If you are an Authorized User, please contact the Business User for whom you are an Authorized User with your
          request to exercise your rights as we may be limited in our ability to respond to your request directly.</p>
        <h3>International data transfer</h3>
        <p>We take steps to ensure that we handle your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards. As a US
          company, most of our operations are conducted in the United States and in order to provide the Services,
          personal information will be processed in the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal
          information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. We provide appropriate protections for
          cross-border transfers as required by applicable law for international data transfers. With respect to
          transfers originating from the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK, where applicable, the standard
          contractual clauses and the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard
          contractual clauses for international data transfers, approved by the European Commission and the UK
          Information Commissioner, respectively, are implemented. Where required by such laws, you may request a copy
          of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below.</p>
        <p>In some cases, we may provide you with the option to choose the location, including locations in the EEA, in
          which we store and process your data. To the extent we provide that option to you, we will only process and
          store your data in the designated location and not transfer your data outside that jurisdiction, except in
          accordance with applicable law.</p>
