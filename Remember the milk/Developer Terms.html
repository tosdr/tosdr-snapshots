<h2>2. Commercial Use</h2>

<h3>a. Rules and Restrictions.</h3>

<p>If the primary purpose of your application is to derive revenue, it is considered a commercial application. Remember The Milk reserves the right to make these evaluations at the time that you apply for the license. Remember The Milk may also monitor your site or application over time to ensure continued compliance with the appropriate type of API key.</p>

<p>If you're in doubt about whether your application is commercial, here are a few common examples of commercial use that may provide you some guidance:</p>

<p>If you are interested in commercial use of the API, please share your business proposal via our contact form: <a href="/help/contact/?ctx=business">https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/contact/?ctx=business</a>. You can't be too specific about your intended use of the Remember The Milk Commercial API! Lack of specificity or supporting information could delay your application indefinitely. When in doubt, it's always better to include more detail about your application. Please note that in some cases we may grant your request for a commercial API key subject to your payment of fees, such as to help cover infrastructure costs.</p>
