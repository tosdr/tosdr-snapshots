            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of us and any of our suppliers
                under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
                limited to the amount actually paid by you for the service. To the maximum extent permitted by
                applicable law, in no event shall we or our suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect,
                or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for
                loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy
                arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the service, third-party software
                and/or third-party hardware used with the service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this
                Agreement), even if we or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if
                the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
                you.</p>
            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed
                and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
                applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by us on the
                Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Services. If any
                provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of
                such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall
