    <p>If you believe that your work has been used on form1-p.com’s Site or in connection with its Service in any manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify form1-p.com’s copyright agent by written notice. The notice should include the following information:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the material at issue is not authorized by the copyright owner, the agent of the copyright owner or the law; and</li>
        <li>A statement by you that the information in this notification is accurate and a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner of the material allegedly infringed or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p id="link14"><strong>13. Applicable Law</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and form1-p.com are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p id="link15"><strong>14. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS</p>
    <p>ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT; THE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION. THE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>General. Except as otherwise provided in this section 15, by using the Site and Services, you and form1-p.com agree to submit any disputes arising from the use of the Site or Services or any interpretation, violation, non-performance, termination or invalidity of these Terms of Service or this arbitration provision (including questions of its formation and enforceability) to final and binding arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, which can be found here, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with those Rules. Notwithstanding these rules, however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the state of California as set forth in section 14 above. You agree to submit to binding arbitration in either San Francisco, California or your county of residence. form1-p.com will agree to commence arbitration in your county of residence. At your written request, form1-p.com will consider any requests to advance or reimburse any arbitration filing fee, or administrative and hearing fees that you are required to pay to pursue a claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying those fees. In no event will you be required to reimburse form1-p.com for any arbitration filing, administrative, or hearing fees in an amount greater than what your court costs would have been if the claim had been resolved in court. Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Further, the arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages in any arbitration initiated under this section, except as may be required by statute.</li>
        <li>Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve any dispute will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor form1-p.com will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration proceeding may be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the applicable proceeding.</li>
        <li>NO RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL FOR ARBITRAL CLAIM. YOU AND ASK ALSO HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY ARBITRAL CLAIM. IF FOR ANY REASON THIS SECTION 15 IS HELD NOT TO APPLY TO AN ARBITRAL CLAIM, WHETHER SUCH ARBITRAL CLAIM IS AGAINST YOU, ASK, OR ASK INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, BOTH YOU AND ASK STILL AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY FOR THAT ARBITRAL CLAIM. BY USING THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</li>
        <li>Exception. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, this agreement does not preclude claims by form1-p.com to enforce its intellectual property rights and/or remedy unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, unauthorized access, fraud or computer fraud, and/or industrial espionage. Neither party is precluded from seeking relief in a court located in San Francisco, for provisional remedies, including temporary restraining order, preliminary injunctions, and receiverships, pending arbitration or comprehensive litigation, to the extent authorized in this section 15.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="link16"><strong>15. Severability of These Terms of Service</strong></p>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, the remaining provisions contained in these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
    <p id="link17"><strong>16. Limitation of Actions Brought against form1-p.com</strong></p>
    <p>You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the Site or Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by form1-p.com to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms of Service or any related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
    <p id="link18"><strong>17. Third Party Beneficiaries</strong></p>
    <p>You agree that, except for form1-p.com and as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Service, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this agreement.</p>
    <p id="link19"><strong>18. Section Titles</strong></p>
    <p>The section titles in this Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
