TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT<br/></h2><p>We collect two types of information – “personal information” and “anonymous information” – which we may use to create a third type of information, “aggregate information”.  </p><ul role="list"><li>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”, also often referred to as “<strong>Personal Data</strong>”, means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, household, or device, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, username, and/or image.  </li></ul><ul role="list"><li>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual, household, or device.  </li></ul><ul role="list"><li>“<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>” means information about groups or categories of individuals which does not identify, and cannot reasonably be used, to identify an individual, household, or device. We may share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with other parties without restriction.</li></ul><p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p><p>We collect the information which you provide us which may include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Registration or Account Information</strong>. Information you provide when you register to use our Services or create an account such as: your first name and last name, country of residence, date of birth, e-mail address, username and password.  </li>Not all information will be mandatory to create the account or register to use the Services, for example we do not ask you to provide sensitive information or special category data (such as that regarding your race, ethnicity, religious beliefs or sexual orientation). However, if you opt to provide more information, please note that this may become publicly available depending on its nature and why it was provided (e.g. your image for your account profile photo).  </ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Linked Account.</strong> When creating your account, and depending on the Services used, you may opt to link an existing profile with a third-party provider (such as a social media account) to create your account to use the Services. Please note that we will use the personal information made available to us from the third-party profile that we deem necessary for the creation of the account and for the best experience when using the Services. If you would like to delete any of this information, you can do so within your account, to the extent the information is not mandatory to your account.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Purchase and Transaction Information</strong>. When you purchase a Service from us, we will collect certain information which may include identification information (copy of valid passport or government-issued photo identification document), your date of birth, your postal and/or residential address, telephone number and payment information. If the Services you use allow you to conduct transactions, we may collect and retain some or all of the information related to these transactions, including transaction amount(s), parties involved, time and manner of exchange, and other transaction circumstances, such as payment method and names or emails of external third-party accounts (for example, PayPal or Skrill).</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Information You Provide when Using our Services</strong>. Please note that our Services may offer chat functions (either one-to-one or within a limited group) or other forms of communication services (such as real time voice communication either one-to-one or within a limited group), forums, community environments (including multiplayer gameplay) or other tools that are either restricted to other account holders or Services users or that do not have a restricted audience and can be accessible by anyone. Any information, content or communications, including personal information, you provide when you use any of these features will be available to the recipients (dependent on the nature of the tool) and may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party.  </li>While we endeavour at all times to protect the privacy of our users and to ensure no harm is caused through our Services, given the nature of the tools, we have no obligation to keep private any information you made available to other users or the public using these functions. To request removal of your personal information that you have posted via such a tool, please see the “Your Controls, Rights and Choices” section below.</ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Your Marketing Preferences</strong>.

However, we may receive limited information from a business partner or service provider if you became a user of our Services through the use of theirs. For example, if you learn of our Services through a joint campaign with a business partner, the business partner may inform us of this connection.</p><p><strong>Sensitive or Special Category Data</strong></p><p>We generally do not actively seek any sensitive or special category data from you, but we may be exposed to it pursuant to your use of the Services. For example, if when using our chat functions or other communication services, you choose to discuss your political views, sexual orientation or other sensitive or special category data, this will be collected by us as with any other information in the communications.
