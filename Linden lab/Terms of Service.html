You agree that the license includes the right to copy, analyze and use any of your Content as Linden Lab may deem necessary or desirable for purposes of debugging, testing, or providing support or development services in connection with the Service and future improvements to the Service.

This license is referred to as the &quot;User Content License,&quot; and the Content being licensed is referred to as &quot;User Content.&quot; &quot;Publicly accessible&quot; areas of the Service are those areas that are accessible to other users of that aspect of the Service.</p><p>If you do not wish to grant users of the Service a User Content License, you agree that it is your obligation to avoid displaying or making available your Content to other users.</p><p>Your interactions with the Service may include use of a permissions system as provided in an applicable Product Policy. Any agreement you make with other users relating to use or access to your Content must be consistent with these Terms and the applicable Product Policy, and no such agreement can abrogate, nullify, void or modify these Terms or the applicable Product Policy.</p><p>You acknowledge that when you receive a User Content License you receive only licensing and use rights; therefore, you do not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright or other Intellectual Property Rights in the Content.</p><p><strong>2.5 You also grant Linden Lab and other users of the Service a license to use your Content in snapshots and machinima that is displayed in publicly accessible areas of the Service.</strong></p><p>You agree that by uploading, publishing, or submitting any Content to or through the Servers for display in any publicly accessible area of the Service, you hereby grant other users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to photograph, capture an image of, film, and record a video of the Content, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the resulting photograph, image, film, or video in any current or future media as provided in and subject to the restrictions and requirements of an applicable Product Policy or other policy. The foregoing license is referred to as the &quot;Snapshot and Machinima Content License.&quot;</p><p><strong>2.6 You may delete copies of your Content from the Service, and the licenses you have granted for the deleted copies will terminate with certain limitations.</strong></p><p>Where permitted, you may delete copies or instances of your Content that you have displayed or that are in your Account inventory through the normal functionality of the Service, such as by emptying the trash folder in your Account inventory as applicable. In such event, the licenses granted by you in this Section 2 shall terminate in the manner provided below, but only for those particular copies or instances of Content that you have deleted from the Service.</p><p>You acknowledge that this termination will not apply to any other copies or instances of the same Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Service, including without limitation those that may be displayed elsewhere through the Service and those that may be in the Account inventories of other users to whom you transferred copies.</p><p>You acknowledge that the Snapshot and Machinima Content License granted to Linden Lab and other users with respect to your Content will survive any such termination.</p><p>You also acknowledge that the Service Content License granted to Linden Lab with respect to your Content will survive any such termination solely as follows to permit Linden Lab: (i) to retain server copies of particular instances of your Content, including copies stored in connection with back-up, debugging, and testing procedures; and (ii) to enable the exercise of the licenses granted in this Section 2 for any other copies or instances of the same Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Service, including those that may be displayed elsewhere through the Service or exist in other users&#x27; Account inventories.</p><p><strong>2.7 You agree to respect the Intellectual Property Rights of other users, Linden Lab, and third parties.</strong></p><p>You agree that you will not publish, or submit to any part of the Service, any Content that is protected by Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise subject to proprietary rights, including trade secret or privacy rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from the rightful owner to upload, publish, or submit the Content and to grant Linden Lab and users of the Service all of the license rights granted in these Terms.</p><p>You acknowledge that the Content of the Service is provided or made available to you under license from Linden Lab and independent Content providers, including other users of the Service (&quot;Content Providers&quot;). You acknowledge and agree that except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intellectual Property Rights of Linden Lab and other Content Providers in their respective Content are not licensed to you by your mere use of the Service. You must obtain from the applicable Content Providers any necessary license rights in Content that you desire to use or access.</p><p>Linden Lab and other Content Providers may use the normal functionality of the Service, including an applicable permissions system and the copy, modify, and transfer settings, to indicate how you may use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, or perform their respective Content solely through the Service. You acknowledge and agree that the permissions system and other functionality of the Service do not grant you any license, consent, or permission to copy, modify, transfer, or use in any manner any Content outside the Service.</p><p>You agree that you will not copy, transfer, or distribute outside the Service any Content that contains any Linden Content, in whole or in part or in modified or unmodified form, except as allowed by an applicable Product Policy or other policy, or that infringes or violates any Intellectual Property Rights of Linden Lab, other Content Providers, or any third parties.</p><p>Linden Lab reserves the right, but is not obligated to use technological measures designed to prohibit the copying, transfer, or distribution of Content outside the Service when we in good faith believe that such copying, transfer, or distribution would or might violate the Intellectual Property Rights of our users, Linden Lab, or third parties.</p><p>You copy and use Content at your own risk. You are solely responsible and liable for your use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display, or performance of any Content in violation of any Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that Linden Lab will have no liability for, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Linden Lab harmless for, any claims, losses or damages arising out of or in connection with your use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display, or performance of any Content.</p><p><a href="#page-hero">Return to top</a></p><h2>3.

Further, you and Linden Lab agree that, should resolution of the Dispute(s) occur in arbitration, such Dispute(s) will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Linden Lab, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California.</p><p>Should either you or Linden Lab elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), except that, as noted, in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years&#x27; experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.</p><p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a &quot;demand for arbitration,&quot; then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) using JAMS&#x27; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Linden Lab consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service.</p><p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p><p>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or <a target="_external" href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a><br/>JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or <a target="_external" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a></p><p>All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, an arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology) or in City and County of San Francisco, California. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco, California. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&#x27;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including any rules regarding hardship); but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Linden Lab to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Linden Lab will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys&#x27; fees) consistent with applicable law.</p><p><strong>10.2 Exceptions to Requirement to Arbitrate.</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.1, either party may seek judicial relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (a) to enforce an arbitral award issued hereunder, (b) to compel arbitration required hereunder or (c) to obtain temporary injunctive relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue, terminate or modify any such relief. In the event of a request for temporary injunctive relief, the requirement for 60 days&#x27; dialogue before an arbitration can be initiated shall not apply.</p><p>As set out in Section 10.1, in the event a court or arbitrator determines that the limitation of the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Linden Lab (prohibiting class or representative proceedings) is unenforceable, the Dispute then must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California.</p><p><a href="#page-hero">Return to top</a></p><h2>11.
