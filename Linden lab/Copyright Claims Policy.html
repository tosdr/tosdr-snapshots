Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys&#x27; fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing.</p><p>Linden Lab may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Linden Lab may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA. If Linden Lab decides to remove or disable access to the material, we will notify the party that posted the material, provide them with access to the DMCA Notice, and provide information on how to file a DMCA Counter-Notice (as described below).</p><p><em>Please note that these notifications and the counter-notifications described below are real-world legal notices.

If Linden Lab receives a DMCA Counter-Notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), then we may forward it to the person who filed the original DMCA Notice. In such circumstance, if Linden Lab does not receive notice from that person within 10 business days that they are seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may, in our sole discretion, replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p><p>Without limiting Linden Lab&#x27;s other rights, Linden Lab will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer&#x27;s access to the Service and any other property owned or operated by Linden Lab.</p><h2>2.
