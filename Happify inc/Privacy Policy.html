That means that what happens around us has less of an impact on our happiness than how we perceive our life. 90% of our long-term happiness depends on how our brain processes the world. As a result, no matter where we are, if we work at it, we can raise our levels of optimism and happiness. And boosting our happiness raises our success rates at the same time. In previous research, we have found that optimistic sales people outsell their negative counterparts by 37%. Doctors in a positive state of mind perform diagnoses 19% faster and more accurate than doctors at neutral. Positive employees are 31% more productive than negative employees. In other words, optimism is crucial to the business outcomes we actively pursue: productivity, intelligence, creativity, endurance, and engagement. <br /> <br /> Work optimism is not just about us. When people are sick with a cold and contagious, we want them to stay home from work so they don’t get everyone else sick. What we often forget is that our mental outlook at work is just as contagious. We know that extreme work pessimism dramatically decreases the effectiveness and happiness of the person experiencing it, but that is not the end of it. Extreme work pessimism can actually lower the work optimism scores of our co-workers. When we feel extreme work pessimism we literally become toxic and people can pick up on our pessimism like second-hand smoke. Remember, you don’t have to be the one smoking to get the negative health effects. <br /> <br /> On the other end of the spectrum, visionary work optimists are also contagious. Positive psychology research reveals that when we are in contact with visionary work optimists, we start to feel more positive, engaged and hopeful at work. When visionary work optimists are leaders, they can actually raise the entire productivity of their team. Whereas extreme work pessimism is a disease, visionary work optimism provides enhanced health to a team. Smiles have been found to be 10X more contagious than frowns. In this research we found that visionary optimists are over 5X more likely to be engaged with their work in an effective way.","f95dc5e5":"premium","f94d7cc8":"See our full list of tracks","f945638d":"Commented {{discussion}} discussion.","f931874f":"Jam","f92fb73a":"{{start}} {{incentive}} \n(ends {{date}})","f92da2a4":"Security","f91c70bd":"Completed a {{assessment}}","f8f26f0f":"Premium","f8e7516d":"to meaningful goals","f8e4e273":"year","f8ce7665":"Your free trial membership has expired. {{buy}}.","f8bae79f":"humor","f8a3ae7b":"new invites","f88cf727":"Receiving a genuine compliment feels wonderful, but <em>giving</em> a compliment can give you an even more powerful positivity boost.

Which to some extent is true. Unless you are a complete narcissist, you know your behavior will not alter the global economy. But the problem comes when our brains \"overlearn\" this—our brains can start to think that NONE of our behavior matters. <br/> <br/> In the midst of the economic crisis, Michelle Gielan, at the time an anchor of two national newscasts at CBS News, could see the brutal effect the financial crisis was having on viewers. She produced <a href=\"http://goodthinkinc.com/speaking/michelle-gielan/\">\"Happy Week\"</a>, during which she interviewed positive psychologists who shared research on mindset and habit changes people could make to foster greater happiness in the midst of challenging times. Viewers flooded CBS with positive emails on how they changed their behavior and that had not only made them feel more financial peace, but at times also spurred positive behaviors that saved homes, rebuilt savings, and reconnected families who had been fighting over money. <br/> <br/> It does not take a crisis to connect positive engagement to success rates. This metric that you just took helps assess how much your brain believes that you can influence the outcomes at work. You might be thinking to yourself: yes, but IN REALITY, I cannot control all the outcomes at work. No one can, not even an Engagement Master. The important part is how much you focus your brain on the activities you CAN control. As a result, instead of constantly scanning for disempowering facets of work, Engagement Masters scan their work for every way that they could leverage their behavior to get the outcome they desire in the midst of the normal challenges at work.","3f8d9fe1":"Your posts from this track","3f7682a6":"You answered {{result}}% correctly\\nOthers averaged {{result_other}}% correctly","3f6ff969":"Terms","3f4e63ff":"Your happiness is important to us!\r\nSpend just a few minutes\r\ncompleting this scientifically\r\nvalidated assessment.","3f2ffa6c":"CONTINUE","3f1e0361":"Happiness","3f1d9e49":"Cannot connect to Twitter.","3f08233c":"By paying attention to the details and winning the game, you&#39;ll also enjoy the effects of positive mood induction.

Social support is defined by the quality, and to some extent the quantity, of the people you feel you can depend on and share your highs and lows. But after working with companies all over the globe, we found that some people, who feel immense social support at home, could feel impoverished when it came to social support at work. We needed a scale that accurately assessed your social support at work. <br /> <br /> That is when the big discovery came. <br /> <br /> We kept asking all the questions about how much social support you were receiving, but when we flipped around the question, suddenly, the measures we were using began providing extraordinarily high definition predictions of your success and happiness at work. In other words, how much social support you give is extraordinarily predictive of work performance and happiness. <br /> Giving social support is much more important than getting it. For a great read on this new research, check out the <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/01/positive-intelligence/ar/1\">Harvard Business Review article</a> on \"Positive Intelligence\". <br /> <br /> Thus, the second indicator assesses how well you provide social support to your co-workers.","39cf82fc":"Gold","39c41e53":"Workforce Happiness<br/>Assessment","39b0c1fe":"blurry","39a68613":"The power of positivity","39a0012c":"Very much like me","398ecd7e":"Type a message…","398288b7":"You can continue through your track part, or take the <span style=\"color: #ff8414;\">gold</span> and skip the remaining activities.","3977a69b":"The Happify Experience","394dd6e2":"LIFETIME GIFT MEMBERSHIP","394b4fe4":"Follow Happify on Twitter!","3949402a":"Continue<br/>Track","394604ec":"Science shows that we're more likely to achieve our goals if we have social support.","393df2f9":"User","393d8c3c":"One or more of our Apps may require that you be registered and signed in in order to use them.

But in the past ten years, we’ve also discovered that lack of social support has an equally powerful effect on longevity. <br /> <br /> In <a href=\"http://goodthinkinc.com/speaking/shawn-achor/\">a study</a>; Shawn Achor did on 1600 Harvard students, he could clearly see that social support was the greatest predictor of their long-term happiness. Yet, this is often the very first thing we sacrifice during stressful times. For many of those students, when they became overwhelmed with work, they spent 18 hours in the library. They would come out bleary eyed, exhausted, depressed, hating their school, sick, and even began to see their grades started to decline. When they asked why, Achor would explain that they had unwittingly disconnected from the greatest predictors of their work success: their social support network. Studies show that it is impossible for the brain to work at its highest potential for long without the infusion of strong positive social support and all the benefits that come with it. <br /> <br /> The seventh and final principle in The Happiness Advantage is Social Investment, which is the one in which the happiest and most successful people at work are those who actually increase their investment in their co-workers in times of stress. They provide social support instead of waiting for it to come to them. The <a href=\"http://goodthinkinc.com/resources/books/the-happiness-advantage/\">resulting research</a>, culminating in this Success Scale, proves that giving at the office gets you not only greater happiness and performance, but you also raise you chances for a promotion.","17511383":"Tracks are designed to help you develop your well‑being skills for specific life situations.

Are your brain's resources focused on work and creating a positive future, or is it stuck scanning for the negative? When you go in to work, do you expect good things to happen or are you dreading the worst? Some people seem to be optimists at home, but when they get to work, they operate like pessimists. That is why the older ways of testing optimism are flawed. They assumed that your general optimism could predict work performance. What we discovered is that your optimism at work is a much better predictor of your success at work.","0767c53a":"It might be surprising to hear, but new research shows that only 10% of our long term happiness at work is based upon our external world. That means that what happens around us has less of an impact on our happiness than how we perceive our life. 90% of our long-term happiness depends on how our brain processes the world. As a result, no matter where we are, if we work at it, we can raise our levels of optimism and happiness. And boosting our happiness raises our success rates at the same time.In previous research, we have found that optimistic sales people outsell their negative counterparts by 37%. Doctors in a positive state of mind perform diagnoses 19% faster and more accurate than doctors at neutral. Positive employees are 31% more productive than negative employees. In other words, optimism is crucial to the business outcomes we actively pursue: productivity, intelligence, creativity, endurance, and engagement.","5b6ddcb0":"Work optimism is not just about us. When people are sick with a cold and contagious, we want them to stay home from work so they don't get everyone else sick. What we often forget is that our mental outlook at work is just as contagious. We know that extreme work pessimism dramatically decreases the effectiveness and happiness of the person experiencing it, but that is not the end of it. Extreme work pessimism can actually lower the work optimism scores of our co-workers. When we feel extreme work pessimism we literally become toxic and people can pick up on our pessimism like second-hand smoke. Remember, you don't have to be the one smoking to get the negative health effects.","486bfd33":"On the other end of the spectrum, visionary work optimists are also contagious. Positive psychology research reveals that when we are in contact with visionary work optimists, we start to feel more positive, engaged and hopeful at work. When visionary work optimists are leaders, they can actually raise the entire productivity of their team. Whereas extreme work pessimism is a disease, visionary work optimism provides enhanced health to a team. Smiles have been found to be 10X more contagious than frowns. In this research we found that visionary optimists are over 5X more likely to be engaged with their work in an effective way.","44740dac":"From previous research, we knew that social support &mdash; how much you can rely upon and turn to your family and friends &mdash; was a major predictor of happiness. Social support is defined by the quality, and to some extent the quantity, of the people you feel you can depend on and share your highs and lows. But after working with companies all over the globe, we found that some people, who feel immense social support at home, could feel impoverished when it came to social support at work. We needed a scale that accurately assessed your social support at work.","7bd89a3e":"That is when the big discovery came.","8e27fecf":"Thus, the second indicator assesses how well you provide social support to your co-workers.","cb1e8e3d":"Do you believe that your behavior matters at work? Why would you work eight hours on a project if you thought that you would receive no benefit for your behavior? When challenged, do outside events control your success rates at work?<br/>The third pillar of the Success Scale is positive engagement.","aec655ac":"Our brain is designed to use its resources effectively. When our brain believes that our actions will not result in the outcomes we want at work, our brain provides lower energy and engagement with those tasks. Our brain shuts down to save energy for more important and efficient tasks. The problem comes when our brain starts to shut down performance at work.","7add700b":"The key to using our brain's resources effectively is to train our brain to recognize that our behavior at work matters.<br/>Thus, the final survey assesses how confident you are that you can control your outcomes at work.","1b8f2b5e":"In our research, we have found that when the economy is down, when the stock market plummets, when there is restructuring at work, our brain is tempted to believe that our behavior does not matter any more. Which to some extent is true. Unless you are a complete narcissist, you know your behavior will not alter the global economy. But the problem comes when our brains &ldquo;overlearn&rdquo; this&mdash;our brains can start to think that NONE of our behavior matters.","4ba60823":"In the midst of the economic crisis, Michelle Gielan, at the time an anchor of two national newscasts at CBS News, could see the brutal effect the financial crisis was having on viewers. She produced &ldquo;<a href=\"http://goodthinkinc.com/speaking/michelle-gielan/\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Week</a>,&rdquo; during which she interviewed positive psychologists who shared research on mindset and habit changes people could make to foster greater happiness in the midst of challenging times. Viewers flooded CBS with positive emails on how they changed their behavior and that had not only made them feel more financial peace, but at times also spurred positive behaviors that saved homes, rebuilt savings, and reconnected families who had been fighting over money.","7b4bea02":"Happify Sweepstakes Official Rules | Happify","200099b4":"It does not take a crisis to connect positive engagement to success rates. This metric that you just took helps assess how much your brain believes that you can influence the outcomes at work. You might be thinking to yourself: yes, but IN REALITY, I cannot control all the outcomes at work. No one can, not even an Engagement Master. The important part is how much you focus your brain on the activities you CAN control. As a result, instead of constantly scanning for disempowering facets of work, Engagement Masters scan their work for every way that they could leverage their behavior to get the outcome they desire in the midst of the normal challenges at work.","44d2a138":"Learn about Happify's Sweepstakes Official Rules.","bd881bde":"HAPPIFY IT <sup>SM</sup> SPRING SWEEPSTAKES","4f4e5e87":"NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.

In other words, how much social support you give is extraordinarily predictive of work performance and happiness.<br/>Giving social support is much more important than getting it.

Yet, this is often the very first thing we sacrifice during stressful times. For many of those students, when they became overwhelmed with work, they spent 18 hours in the library. They would come out bleary eyed, exhausted, depressed, hating their school, sick, and even began to see their grades started to decline. When they asked why, Achor would explain that they had unwittingly disconnected from the greatest predictors of their work success: their social support network. Studies show that it is impossible for the brain to work at its highest potential for long without the infusion of strong positive social support and all the benefits that come with it.","7d0fb91c":"The seventh and final principle in The Happiness Advantage is Social Investment, which is the one in which the happiest and most successful people at work are those who actually increase their investment in their co-workers in times of stress.

The urge to run to the nearest yoga studio? We all think of stress as the enemy—but is that always the case?","a5139fda":"It's true that negative stress is by far and away the toxin of the day. At one of my recent speaking events, I asked two questions: <q>\"How many of you think that negative stress is an inevitable part of your life?\"</q> followed by <q>\"How many of you think you create the negative stress in your life?\"</q> I was surprised at the response. Not only because many of the same people raised their hands to both questions, but also because so many agreed with the notion that negative stress is inevitable in life.","367a74e3":"I shouldn’t be surprised because, had I not studied psychology and stress for the last 33 years, I would probably have responded in the same way. When we consider our daily lives it certainly seems that negative stress is pervasive.","a9d56d35":"Ready to do it now? Try Happify's science-based activities & games!","d9553037":"Get started","609ed2ae":"So, Where Does All This Negative Stress Come From?","5895c3ff":"It's a result of perceiving that you are being threatened and are unable to control the situation. You likely feel you cannot match the demands of the situation. You've probably heard of the “fight-or-flight” response arising from a perceived threat. During this reaction, your body goes through a number of changes: blood pressure, heart rate and perspiration increase; digestion slows; muscles tense for action; adrenaline and cortisol are released, and a host of other physical changes arise.","709d22aa":"In addition, when we're negatively stressed, any negative emotions we're experiencing, such as fear, anxiety, anger or frustration, are intensified. All becomes well if the pent-up energy and stress hormones are used up allowing for balance in the body.","0679356a":"However, this equilibrium is infrequent for several reasons.","2c311b04":"Blame Your Body for Overreacting","91746de8":"Firstly, you're reacting with the “fight-or-flight” response to events which are not life-threatening. A business deadline, a critical partner, self-criticism, rush hour…these are not life threatening events, but you're responding to these types of frequent, minor hassles as if they were. So you literally remain stressed out much of the time.","f38d6216":"You Have Trouble Letting it Out","878cdd24":"Secondly, the pent-up energy of the stress response is rarely let out as it needs to be to reset balance. If your boss is the stressor, you probably won't run up to him and grab him by the throat (although you may feel like it!). So, the negative stress level within you escalates, causing greater damage to your brain-mind-body. Look at your brain alone. Negative stress decreases creativity, interferes with memory processing, and impairs problem solving and decision-making.","a7b283a4":"So, What's the Key to Eliminating Daily Negative Stress?","92a7f74c":"One route is to go to the cause; namely, the irrational negative thoughts about yourself and the world which, for the most part, you may have held since childhood. These are deeply buried or subconscious and are called automatic thoughts (aka “stinking thinking”). They're the black and white, overgeneralizing thoughts such as \"I'm a failure,\" or \"I'm unlovable.\"","59aeef44":"Find the Evidence. Repeatedly.","384074db":"To rid yourself of negatively stressful thinking, you can challenge it with rational, evidence-based, and more positive thinking. Find evidence from within your life against the belief that you're a failure, for example. Doing this repeatedly and with conscious attention eliminates the dysfunctional thinking and creates and strengthens new positive neuronal pathways in your brain. The more you practice this, the more positive neural pathways become wired in your brain.","a9271d86":"Adjust Your Mindset and Generate \"Prostress\"","2a1ba280":"The second secret weapon in helping you eliminate negative daily stress? Prostress, or positive stress. Prostress arises when you see a situation as a challenge rather than a threat. You believe you can learn or grow from it. You believe you have control over it (even if you don’t). You are actively involved in it and find it meaningful. You feel your resources can meet the demands.","ca1a0133":"A fascinating study by Alex Zautra and John Reich presented in the <cite>American Journal of Community Psychology</cite> revealed that those who experienced a \"positive pawn\" event (for example, receiving money) didn't experience prostress or much life satisfaction, whereas those who were actively involved in and had control over doing a meaningful action (making a new friend, learning a sport) reported prostress, a better quality of life and happiness. Many other studies support such findings about the positive impact of prostress on life satisfaction, mood and even success. The more prostress events, the better, found an earlier study by Larsen, Diener and Cropanzano in the <cite>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</cite>.","2a5ab9c9":"In fact, researchers have found that prostress actually counteracts harmful effects of negative stress on the brain-mind-body. It also boosts the immune system, increases good cholesterol, repairs muscle tissue, encourages physical growth and enhances brain development.","dd2de6ed":"Jetting around the world or driving race cars may cause prostress for some; but events that lead to prostress don't need to be expensive—or risky. Activities like nurturing a hobby, hiking, or learning a language can generate prostress for many people.","8255c80b":"What to Ask Yourself","ddd5d3d8":"The next time you find yourself in what seems like a negative situation, ask yourself some important questions: <q>Can I view this as a challenge and not a threat? Do I have any control over the situation? Is there a way I can learn or grow from trying to turn this situation around?</q> These questions can help you take direct action—and turn stress into prostress.","c039bcfb":"Find science-based activities and exercises to help you cope better with stress—<a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">sign up for Happify today</a>","e7e98e0c":"<a href=\"http://essentialscoaching.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Simone Ravicz</a>, Ph.D, MBA, is a licensed clinical psychologist and business and life coach who helps overstressed small business owners and entrepreneurs maximize their income, obtain balance in their lives, and optimize personal fulfillment and family life.

But only for a short while. If you're like most people, that new purchase eventually lost its luster. But are there certain ways we can spend our money that will bring us real happiness?

Research shows that while buying stuff isn’t bad for happiness, it generally has no effect on increasing our happiness. So, we encourage people to quit buying stuff, and start spending their money in happier ways—from buying experiences to buying themselves better time to investing in other people.","0b568d1b":"Let's say someone received a surprise bonus, and decided to spend it on a mega experience—an exotic vacation in the Galapagos.

Short of that, there are some very simple ways to get more happiness out of every experience you buy. First, make sure you pay for the vacation in full, up front. Nothing ruins a vacation more than feeling the entire time that an enormous bill is awaiting you when you’re done. Paying far enough in advance—with all expenses included – means that when the vacation finally comes, everything feels free. And there’s another advantage to paying far in advance: the months and months of exciting anticipation fantasizing in your narrow cubicle about those sunny beaches. Research shows that one of the biggest vacation-related happiness peaks comes before the vacation even begins.","caa36fd6":"If you won the lottery, what would you spend it on? (and why?)","c49af8f3":"<em><strong>Michael Norton: </strong></em> Despite the fact that <em>Happy Money</em> focuses on how to maximize your happiness bang for every buck you spend, there’s another critical action that leads not so much to happiness right now, but happiness down the road: saving. Saving is difficult in part because it does nothing for our happiness today—but wise saving can provide us with enormous happiness down the road. That said, we’d all probably want to spend at least a little of our millions. If so, I’d focus on buying memorable experiences (a trip to space on Virgin Galactic is “only” $200,000), and investing in others, from friends and family to worthy charities.","185e5d8b":"Want a 4 week plan to spend happier?&nbsp;Maximize your money—and your happiness with the activities, polls, and quizzes in Mike Norton and Elizabeth Dunn's <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">track based on Happy Money.</a>","2eb4b1ab":"By Derrick Carpenter, MAPP","2ca2afaf":"We’ve all been there. You’ve got a laundry list of tasks to finish for the afternoon or you’re starting to get ready for an evening out with friends, but you just can’t shake your bad mood enough to get yourself moving. You're in a funk. And the more you sit around being unproductive, the worse you feel. It's a vicious cycle. What you need is a quick fix to lift your mood so you can feel like yourself again.","eaae5a62":"But before we talk about how to feel better, let’s hit the pause button for a moment. When you catch yourself feeling moody, a helpful initial step is to take a moment to reflect on what’s causing you to feel what you’re feeling. Our emotions are often an outward sign of what’s going on for us internally, and sometimes, the internal stuff justifies the bad mood. If you catch yourself feeling irritated today, maybe it’s because your sister recently offered some unwanted critical feedback. Or you’re feeling guilty for bailing on a friend the other day. Whatever it is that’s going on for you, recognize what might be causing your mood and accept that these emotions may be serving a purpose. Your irritation could be a sign that your big sis is right and you know you need to make a change. And guilt can motivate us to take steps to repair relationships we feel we’ve neglected. Embrace those emotions and take the action you know you need to take.","f52353cd":"There are other times, however, when bad moods pop up from nowhere. Maybe you waited too long to eat lunch or woke up today feeling grumpy. If you need to shake it off, here are three powerful ways to turn your bad mood around.","abe22f20":"Focus on Someone Else","69b7eba1":"A bad mood usually forces us to become overly focused on ourselves. Shifting our attention to others can trick our minds into forgetting our own little world, as we remember everyone else has their ups and downs too. Dacher Keltner, psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley and author of <cite><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393337138/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393337138&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=happify05-20&amp;linkId=6TDDERO7A7UBDGOB\" target=\"_blank\">Born To Be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life</a></cite>, borrows the word <em>jen</em> from Confucius to describe the extent to which we bring out the best in other people and avoid bringing them down. Individuals with a high <em>jen</em> ratio are more likely to commit an act of kindness and compassion and less likely to use a derogatory remark than someone with a low <em>jen</em> ratio. And research by Sonja Lyubomirsky has shown that performing altruistic acts for others reliably increases positive emotions. So help a neighbor. Offer to buy a cup of coffee to the elderly man in line behind you. Take time to really listen to a friend’s problem and help them see the way through. Building them up will lift your mood up.","a944632d":"Get Yourself Moving","a98f9517":"Psychologist Robert Thayer and colleagues identified a number a strategies people use to self-regulate their moods.

Since it's hard to motivate ourselves to head out for a long run when we're in a bad mood, focus on small steps. Watch an aerobic video and commit to the first five minutes. Or put your shoes on and just walk. The effects of exercise can happen so quickly that you might decide to keep going once you’ve started. A bonus technique: move outside.

When an adverse event happens, like receiving an unexpected bill in the mail, pessimists are likely to think of it as being permanent and pervasive. In other words, they say to themselves, <q>“I’m always going to be behind on bills and my life sucks.”</q> Optimists, on the other hand, are more likely to describe the event as temporary and to compartmentalize it. An optimist would say, <q>“I’ll have to cut back for the next month to pay this off, but it will be OK, and at least I’m great at what I do for a living.”</q> If your bad mood stems from a challenge or obstacle you’re dealing with, try to focus on the control you do have to change it, and be realistic about how much of your life it affects. And if all else fails, smile. It sounds almost too easy, but research by Robert Zajonc shows that the simple act of smiling can improve your mood.

They've all been called “the happiest age” in various studies and surveys.","cba797d1":"Psychologists suspect the 30-something birthday scored big because it's a time when people tend to have energy, wisdom, and money all at once. In another study, researchers found that people in their mid-fifties tend to smile the most. And in a third study researchers found that people's happiness is lowest around 44 then starts to build gradually until it peaks in the 70s. The moral of this trio of contradictory facts: There is no such thing as a “happiest age,” although many scientists agree that in general, we get happier with age. (Remember you terrible teenage years?) So rather than waiting to see what the next birthday brings, try to make every year your happiest one yet.","b018a1a3":"40: The approximate percentage of your happiness that is truly up to you","78f3be01":"It's an oversimplification to say that every single person can control exactly 40% of their happiness, but scientists have determined that your happiness level is a result of a complex interaction of genes, behaviors, and life circumstances. While each person has a genetic set point for happiness (like we do for weight), a big chunk of how you feel is under your control, meaning the way you spend your time and the thoughts you allow to linger can really impact your mood and your long-term happiness.","431d1aec":"So what's the takeaway from these numbers? It's not that you need to make $75,000 a year, be a social butterfly, or move to the same neighborhood as your happiest friend—the point is that you can seek more positive interactions and take action to change the way you feel, regardless of your life circumstances.","5c58666c":"Happify gives you the tools to build your well‑being skills through fun, science-based activities and games.  <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">Sign up today!</a>","f050b973":"Jessica Cassity writes about health, fitness, and happiness for publications including Self, Shape, Health, Women's Health, and Family Circle magazines.

Relationships end. Lives are taken too soon. Dreams crumble. No one is immune to these personal setbacks, and while there is no timeline for grief or heartache, there are things you can do to move forward.","df4daa4f":"The strategies to keep you moving through hard times—rather than getting stuck in negative thoughts or feelings of depression—are often the same acts that bring about happiness. It's at the times when happiness seems like a distant memory that the tools used to improve mood can be the most beneficia","22eeb170":"In fact, research shows that the more you use these techniques before a crisis, increasing your overall positivity during relatively <em>good</em> times, the better you'll fare when life gets hard, since positivity creates a buffer against depression. This is your guide to bouncing back.","a3720382":"Set Your Sights on the Future","71589931":"While living in the present is often described as one of the keys to happiness, when the present is full of doubt, hurt, confusion, and sadness, it's okay to imagine a time when things will be different. Part of that involves creating a picture of what your day-to-day life will be like—for instance, imagining yourself cooking dinner for a group of friends.","a644762c":"The other component involves new hopes and dreams for your future, such as making time to finish that degree program you started or planning a family reunion. Setting goals like these allows people to be more positive during times of grief. It also predicted better recovery 12 months after a loss, according to a study from the University of Chicago. By focusing on ways to be happy in the future, you'll automatically have more to live for in the present.","62587d7f":"Channel Positive Memories","d55d16b8":"In the immediate aftermath of a loss, blocking out thoughts associated with the painful event—such as memories of the person you lost—can be an appropriate coping mechanism. But as you move through your grief, research suggests there may be more merit to creating a positive connection and catalog of memories. A study performed at the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology tracked the role of maintaining a bond with the departed among widows who had lost husbands either four months prior or more than two years prior. In the group who had suffered the loss more recently, regularly thinking about their husbands, remembering the good times, or having an internal dialogue with their former partner made them feel worse. But among those who'd had more time to adjust to the loss, those same thoughts made them feel better.","35ebaba7":"Remember to Laugh","0f1227f1":"Studies show that laughter reduces stress and eases symptoms of depression. It's no wonder then that staying in good humor is a valuable way to get through the grieving process. Six months after suffering a loss, people who had more laughter in their lives experienced less grief and depression than those who remained solemn, according to a study from the <em>Omega Journal of Death and Dying</em>. The source of the laughter is irrelevant: whether you get your kicks from watching movies, joking with friends, or at a local dog park, whatever makes you smile—or better yet, laugh—will bring more positive emotions into your life, helping you to crowd out the other feelings.","6695b2b6":"Stay Engaged","1f5dd963":"As some psychology researchers say, the best way to stop being depressed is to stop acting like a depressed person. It may sound harsh, but that means no more moping around, and no more sweatpants and endless bowls of ice cream. Finding ways to stay engaged in your life and active in the pursuits that make you happy is one way to begin working through loss and restoring the life you had before. If you've been declining invitations, accept the next one that comes your way. If you like sports, set a phone reminder to watch a game. If painting is one of your favorite past-times, get out your brushes and get to work. You may not feel ready to get out and live like you used to—and that's totally normal—but the only way to ease back in to a satisfying routine is to keep trying. If you're hesitant, try setting a time limit, such as <q>“I can leave after 30 minutes,</q>” or <q>“I only have to work on this project for 5 minutes.”</q> Chances are once you start, you may have a better time than you thought.","33414d7f":"Happify gives you the tools to build your well‑being skills through fun, science-based activities and games. <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">Sign up today!</a>","30e37d3f":"5 Ways to Find More Time in Your Overscheduled Day","2f6dcbb4":"By Homaira Kabir","ef3d1cd6":"overscheduled day","0c0222a4":"24 short hours—that’s all we’ve got in a day! And yet, in the mad rush of our lives, we are constantly trying to fit a zillion things into its tiny package.","7ceaaa15":"I had been on this busyness treadmill since the start of the New Year. Initially, I got a lot done. But very soon, the pace and structure of my days began to weigh me down. In an ideal world where nothing goes wrong and no one bothers you with their problems, I may have gone on endlessly. But life isn't like that. Kids fall ill, clients need extra help, problems arise and tend to blow up if not attended to. I found myself losing my calm way too often, and felt like I was running on a time treadmill that was draining all joy from my life.","04c03fa5":"I knew I had to let go of at least some of my load. I needed more space in my day. Space to maneuver the uncertainties of life. Space to be there for friends in their times of need. Space to read bedtime stories to my little one before she was too old to want me to. Dr. Rick Hanson, neuropsychologist and Senior Fellow of the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley, calls this practice of creating space, \"emptying the cup\".","c624bb55":"But boy, was it hard! Like the clutter junkie who can't let go of the stuff in their lives, I clung onto each item on my to-do list. I justified its presence and bemoaned the loss of its fruition.

We evolved to benefit from ample breaks, variety and connection. Even our hunter-gatherer <a href=\"https://libcom.org/history/hunter-gatherers-mythology-market-john-gowdy\" target=\"_blank\">ancestors</a> spent no more than 3-4 hours per day in the active pursuit of prey or plant material.

Plot Your Goals on a Time Ladder","01851984":"Even so, we are multi-faceted creatures and there is certainly more than one goal we wish to pursue. And yet, operating on too many fronts simultaneously means that we do justice to none. Our attention gets frazzled, our energy becomes scattered and we leave most things incomplete. Instead, make a list of all that you want to accomplish and prioritize it on a time ladder. (Literally, try drawing an item on each rung of a ladder on a piece of paper!) By focusing on one goal at a time, you’ll organize your time and reclaim the energy that was strewn in all directions.","ca47610d":"4. Draw a Relationships Circle","7fc39f77":"When we fill our agenda with urgent items all day, we leave little space for the important relationships in our lives. Worse, when we do connect, we feel guilty about the work we could've been doing. It's ironic, given that we're the most social animals on the planet and our strength and success lies in the relationships we nurture. Make a pie chart of all the important relationships in your life and honor each one with the time they deserve. Your journey will be far more fulfilling.","ea38dd88":"5. The Two-Column Action Plan","d9350dc8":"Once you've identified and prioritized important goals and acknowledged the relationships you need to nurture, you're ready for action. Take a sheet of paper and draw 2 columns. Now write down the three things you can do more of in one column and the three things you can do less of in the other. Implementing these small and simple changes will begin to move you steadily in the direction of your goals. Then go ahead and take the first step. Action is the best way to create momentum.","df6e5d9a":"When we create space in our days, wonderful things happen. Our minds go from the fast mode of thoughtless action to a slow one where ideas begin to flow. We may think we are doing nothing, but our minds are at their most active, sorting through the clutter of daily events and filing them in memory compartments for easy retrieval. Matthew Liebermann, Professor and Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab Director at UCLA, says that <q>the human brain’s greatest skill is its ability to make sense of the world when doing nothing. Things fall into place, the future gradually sprouts plans and we become aware of our place in the larger perspective.</q>","2e315c8d":"As I consciously began to create space in my day, I started feeling spaciousness grow in my mind. Happily, I breathed in the space to live in the moment, to savor the past and to dream the future. Dr. Philip Zimbardo, professor emeritus at Stanford University, talks about the benefits of changing our time perspective and living in all time frames, past, present and future. As I did so, I felt time stop. And then expand. (Sounds like physics, doesn't it?) And I truly began to appreciate the gifts of opening up my day for the unexpected and the unplanned.","b7f1ae83":"Space is not a waste of our day. Rushing around in mindless pursuits often is. I know that I will never rush to fill it in again, treasuring the moments where I can hang onto that hug just a little longer, gaze at the summer stars just a little deeper, and perhaps, one special day, build in an after-lunch siesta to bide the afternoon away.

Part of Chris’s monumental work in positive psychology was the development of the  VIA (Values In Action) Classification of Character Strengths, a collection of 24 human virtues valued across cultures and time. They include creativity, hope, bravery, and fairness. Everyone has a set of signature strengths  <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">(find out yours by taking the assessment on Happify)</a>, the ones they use most often and most naturally, and research shows that using your signature strengths in new ways boosts well‑being.

And then give them opportunities to use it more.","aad1e42e":"Plan an activity for you and a friend in which you both get to use your signature strengths. An example might be cooking a meal from a different culture where you take the lead on researching the recipes (curiosity) and your friend documents the night with photographs (appreciation of beauty and excellence). There are endless possibilities as long as you keep strengths the focus and inspire each other in the process. Encouraging others to be the best of who they are naturally brings out the best in us.","581f9d8e":"Take a Walk","1741e91d":"In their shoes, that is. Have you ever sped past other cars on a suburban road because you’re running late picking up a child, thinking to yourself, “I don’t want him to worry. I better get there on time!” But when you see another driver speeding past on a different day, you mutter, <q>“What a jerk! Slow down!”</q> When observing the behavior of others, we have a tendency to overestimate the effect of personality and underestimate the effect of circumstances. But when thinking about our own behavior, we do a much better job taking circumstances into account. Psychologists call this the fundamental attribution error. In the example above, we tend not to think about what might be causing the other person to speed. So next time you catch yourself judging someone, take a metaphorical walk in their shoes and ask yourself, <q>“What circumstances might make them do that?”</q> Approaching others with a foundation of understanding allows kindness to shine through and opens us to the possibility of new connections.","cdff1db4":"For more activities to strengthen your relationships and friendships, sign up for Happify today!","c92be23a":"By Amanda MacMillan","f45c6eee":"dwelling","8e770edf":"When something's bothering you, you know that getting your mind off of it is easier said than done.

Bryant describes savoring as three-fold, meaning we can savor the past (reminisce), savor the future (positive anticipation) or savor the present (mindfulness).","84ca7b5d":"Another group of researchers [Quoidbach, Berry, Hansenne, and Mikolajczak (2010)] explored the impact of four savoring strategies on positive affect and life satisfaction. They found that being present and savoring the future or past was associated with positive affect, whereas sharing with others (capitalizing) was positively associated with life satisfaction.","867288eb":"The simple act of identifying and then appreciating the things people do for us is a modern-day wonder drug. It fills us with optimism and self-confidence, knowing that others are there for us.

Well-being and good fortune are increased.","6e5176e5":"Empathy is a powerful word packed with lots of different interpretations. It's the ability to care about others. It's the ability to imagine and understand the emotions, behaviors or ideas of others, including those different from oneself. If you care about the relationships in your life, learning the skill of empathy has enormous payoffs. When we empathize with people, we become less judgmental, less frustrated, angry or disappointed&mdash;and we develop patience. We also solidify the bonds with those closest to us. And when we really listen to the points of view of others, they're very likely to listen to ours.","53e1d796":"Richard Davidson, professor of psychology at University of Wisconsin-Madison, was the first to show that compassion is a skill that we can all learn.

Until that point, I’d been working as a professional coach setting goals with clients, but my knowledge on that subject was limited to what I could find in self-help books, which wasn’t much. At Penn, I learned that there is a science to goal-setting and goal pursuit, and even that there is a well-validated theory called “Goal Setting Theory.” I also learned that there is a scientific approach to goal-setting that we can all use to maximize our chances of success. In early 2009, I published the first evidence-based book on goal-setting and how it intersects with the science of well‑being, <a href=\"http://creatingyourbestlifelist.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Creating Your Best Life</em></a>. In it, I wove together all of the research I had found on creating success and taught readers how to apply it to their own lives. Following are some of the most important tips I can pass along to get you going:","06ac5c4b":"By Acacia Parks, PhD","673fa924":"What <em>is</em> happiness? People have agonized over this question for centuries, but only recently has science begun to weigh in on the debate. Before I get into what the science has concluded, let me start by giving some answers to a somewhat easier question: what <em>isn’t</em> happiness?","b216a1b0":"Happiness is Not: Feeling Good All The Time","f782964b":"Goal Setting Strategy #1: Take your own emotional temperature first","87f10087":"Skeptics have often asked whether a person who uses cocaine every day is “happy.” If feeling good all the time were our only requirement, then the answer would be “yes.” However, recent research suggests that an even-keeled mood is more psychologically healthy than a mood in which you achieve great heights of happiness regularly&mdash;after all, what goes up must come down. Furthermore, when you ask people what makes their lives worth living, they rarely say anything about their mood. They are more likely to cite things that they find <em>meaningful</em>, such as their work or relationships. Recent research even suggests that if you focus too much on trying to feel good all the time, you’ll actually undermine your ability to feel good at <em>all</em>&mdash;in other words, no amount of feeling good will be satisfying to you, since what you expect (all the time) isn’t physically possible for most people.","dcb09ca2":"Happiness is Not: Being Rich or Affording Everything You Want","2721468c":"While living below the poverty line certainly makes it hard to be happy, beyond that, money does not appear to buy happiness. Imagine you unexpectedly get a $10,000/year raise. While you would certainly be excited in the short term, it would only be a matter of time before your expectations change to fit your new budget. Before you know it, you’re just as happy as you were before the raise! This holds true for new houses, new cars, new gadgets, and all of the other material goods that people spend so much time pining for. The only exception to this rule is when you spend your money on <a href=\"/public/articles/can-we-really-change-how-happy-we-are-for-good/\">experiences with other people</a> so if you took that extra $10,000/year and spent it on some weekend getaways to new and exciting places with your friends or family, then you might get happier. However, this is rarely how people choose to spend windfalls.","d6bd3860":"Happiness is Not: A Final Destination","0f043ffe":"The old adage, “Are we there yet?” is often applied to discussions of happiness, as if a person works towards happiness and one day “arrives.” Contrary to popular belief, however, unless you are one of the few who won the genetic lottery and are naturally happy, it takes regular effort to maintain happiness. Most established techniques for becoming happier&mdash;keeping a gratitude journal, for example&mdash;are habits, not one-shot events, and most life events that make us happy in the short-term, like getting married or being promoted, fade over time as we adapt to them.","416105af":"So, What IS Happiness?","48739c49":"The research suggests that happiness is a combination of how satisfied you are with your life (for example, finding meaning in your work) and how good you feel on a day-to-day basis. Both of these are relatively stable&mdash;that is, our life changes, and our mood fluctuates, but our <em>general</em> happiness is more genetically determined than anything else. The good news is, with consistent effort, this can be offset. Think of it like you think about weight: if you eat how you want to and are as active as you want to be, your body will settle at a certain weight. But if you eat less than you'd like or exercise more, your weight will adjust accordingly. If that new diet or exercise regimen becomes part of your everyday life, then you'll stay at this new weight. If you go back to eating and exercising the way you used to, your weight will return to where it started. So it goes, too, with happiness.","e6708d59":"In other words, you have the ability to control how you feel&mdash;and with consistent practice, you can form life-long habits for a more satisfying and fulfilling life. <a href=\"#modal\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">Learn how Happify gives you the tools to take charge of your happiness on a daily basis</a>.","9eb0985b":"Acacia Parks, Ph.D is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Hiram College, where she teaches classes on the science of happiness.

And gratitude doesn't need to be reserved only for momentous occasions: Sure, you might express gratitude after receiving a promotion at work, but you can also be thankful for something as simple as a delicious piece of pie. <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_gratitude_is_good/\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> by UC Davis psychologist Robert Emmons, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Science-Gratitude-Make-Happier/dp/0618620192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1368836503&sr=8-1&keywords=thanks/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Thanks!: How the New Science of Gratitude Can Make You Happier</em></a>, shows that simply keeping a gratitude journal&mdash;regularly writing brief reflections on moments for which we’re thankful&mdash;can significantly increase well‑being and life satisfaction.","527dc17b":"You’d think that just one of these findings is compelling enough to motivate an ingrate into action.

Gratitude journaling works because it slowly changes the way we perceive situations by adjusting what we focus on. While you might always be thankful for your great family, just writing “I’m grateful for my family” week after week doesn’t keep your brain on alert for fresh grateful moments.

In fact, you've probably read about or watched a few of these stories unfold in the past month. Here's how it usually plays out: One person will do a good deed&mdash;such as placing a cup of coffee on reserve for a homeless person, or paying off a stranger's layaway balance at Kmart&mdash;then a trend will start, with more and more people getting in on the act. The result is a feel-good story for all.

Recipients of kindness generally want to keep paying it forward, says James Fowler, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, San Diego. In fact, in one of Fowler's studies, he found that a single act of kindness typically inspired several more acts of generosity.  The scientific name for this chain of altruism is “upstream reciprocity,” but you can think of it as a domino effect of warm and fuzzy feelings: If you drop a quarter into an expired parking meter, the recipient of that small act of generosity will be inspired to do a kind act for someone else, and on and on.","b5f41f92":"To a Potential Friend","05a66a0b":"The Helper's High","cdcb8f20":"I made cupcakes and brought them in to share with my new coworkers.

When you are kind to another person, your brain's pleasure and reward centers light up, as if you were the recipient of the good deed&mdash;not the giver, according to research from  Emory University. This phenomenon has actually earned the nickname “helper's high” among psychologists who study generosity, and some researchers theorize that the sensation is also due to a release of endorphins, those feel-good chemicals associated with runner's high.  It's no surprise then, that a 2010 Harvard Business School survey of happiness in 136 countries found that people who are altruistic&mdash;in this case, people who were generous financially, such as with charitable donations&mdash;were happiest overall.","c7b70802":"A Grateful Moment","45e361af":"Of course, part of why giving feels good is because we know we're lifting someone else's spirits .

The effects of kindness can be so great that you actually don't have to be directly linked to a giving chain to get in on the act. By simply witnessing generosity you may be inspired to do something generous of your own,  according to new research from Fowler, who found that simply observing kindness can spur more acts of good. Humans often mimic behavior they see, and that includes generosity, which explains why some of these stories of small acts of kindness become bigger news: Even people who simply hear about a giving chain are often inspired to give, starting a chain of positivity all their own.","32d33a51":"Make Someone Smile","8f7a2989":"To the mom who asked for help in getting clothes for her children…I'm putting together a bag of my son's old clothes to give to her.

Don't do a lot of food shopping? Think about something else that requires concentration: the order of books on your bookshelf, or the order of songs in an album or playlist you like to listen to, for example. You don't have to do it for long&mdash;maybe 30 seconds or a minute, but the key is to be disciplined about it and do it each time that negative thought comes back&mdash;even if that means doing it 20 times an hour. \"It may seem temporary, but if you reinforce these patterns enough, it can improve your mood and your decision making abilities,\" says Winch. \"You can actually train your brain to go in a different direction when these thoughts come up.\"","3b104009":"It may sound crazy, but clearing your head of a nagging thought could be as easy as writing it down on a piece of paper&mdash;and tossing it in the trash, according to a 2012 Ohio State University study. People who wrote down negative things about their bodies and then threw them away had a more positive self image a few minutes later, compared to those who kept the papers with them. “However you tag your thoughts&mdash;as trash or as worthy of protection&mdash;seems to make a difference in how you use those thoughts,” says study co-author and psychology professor Richard Petty, PhD.

Yale researchers discovered in 2012  that people recalled fewer negative feelings about a past lonely experience when they were holding a hot pack. (They also found that lonely people tend to take longer hot showers.) Substituting physical warmth for emotional warmth can be a quick fix, the researchers say&mdash;just don't let it take the place of real human interaction in the long run.","576777c1":"\"If your urge to ruminate is very strong, distracting yourself isn't going to be easy,\" says Winch. \"So before you try, it may be necessary to reframe or reappraise the situation in your head. If you get stuck in the airport for hours because of a cancelled flight, for example, don't think of what you're missing out on. Instead, see it as a chance to get work done, or to call your parents or an old friend. Once you've successfully reframed your situation, it may be easier to distract yourself with a visualization exercise (like Winch's \"shopping list\" exercise), a book or crossword puzzle, or a quick stroll.","8a7972f0":"Learn strategies for defeating negative thoughts through fun, science-based activities and games: Sign up for Happify today!","5fb1445b":"\"It may sound crazy, but clearing your head of a nagging thought could be as easy as writing it down on a piece of paper -- and tossing it in the trash.\"","8666a732":"Stress Can be Good for You – Stress Benefits","6507d12a":"We all think of stress as the enemy—but is that always the case?

At one of my recent speaking events, I asked two questions:  \"How many of you think that negative stress is an inevitable part of your life?\" followed by \"How many of you think you create the negative stress in your life?\" I was surprised at the response.  Not only because many of the same people raised their hands to <em>both</em> questions, but also because so many agreed with the notion that negative stress is inevitable in life.","990b8072":"Please enter a valid day","7f2ef79a":"I shouldn’t be surprised because, had I not studied psychology and stress for the last 33 years, I would probably have responded in the same way.  When we consider our daily lives it certainly seems that negative stress is pervasive.","2272903f":"Please enter a valid month","4490329b":"It's a result of perceiving that you are being threatened and are unable to control the situation.  You likely feel you cannot match the demands of the situation.  You've probably heard of the “fight-or-flight” response arising from a perceived threat.  During this reaction, your body goes through a number of changes:  blood pressure, heart rate and perspiration increase; digestion slows; muscles tense for action; adrenaline and cortisol are released, and a host of other physical changes arise.","27c2c1b4":"Please enter a valid year","4739eb8c":"Firstly, you're reacting with the “fight-or-flight” response to events which are <em>not</em> life-threatening.  A business deadline, a critical partner, self-criticism, rush hour…these are not life threatening events, but you're responding to these types of frequent, minor hassles as if they were.  So you literally remain stressed out much of the time.","3402a71e":"Please enter a valid date","b5cd047f":"Secondly, the pent-up energy of the stress response is rarely let out as it needs to be to reset balance.  If your boss is the stressor, you probably won't run up to him and grab him by the throat (although you may feel like it!).  So, the negative stress level within you escalates, causing greater damage to your brain-mind-body.  Look at your brain alone.  Negative stress decreases creativity, interferes with memory processing, and impairs problem solving and decision-making.","177a1df5":"One route is to go to the cause; namely, the irrational negative thoughts about yourself and the world which, for the most part, you may have held since childhood.  These are deeply buried or subconscious and are called automatic thoughts (aka “stinking thinking”).  They're the black and white, overgeneralizing thoughts such as \"I'm a failure,\" or \"I'm unlovable.\"","2ded0fb4":"To rid yourself of negatively stressful thinking, you can challenge it with rational, evidence-based, and more positive thinking.  Find evidence from within your life against the belief that you're a failure, for example.  Doing this repeatedly and with conscious attention eliminates the dysfunctional thinking <em>and</em> creates and strengthens new positive neuronal pathways in your brain.  The more you practice this, the more positive neural pathways become wired in your brain.","ec7420b3":"The second secret weapon in helping you eliminate negative daily stress? <em>Prostress</em>, or positive stress. Prostress arises when you see a situation as a challenge rather than a threat.  You believe you can learn or grow from it.  You believe you have control over it (even if you don’t).  You are actively involved in it and find it meaningful.  You feel your resources can meet the demands.","d612d0fd":"A fascinating study by Alex Zautra and John Reich presented in the <em>American Journal of Community Psychology</em> revealed that those who experienced a \"positive pawn\" event (for example, receiving money) didn't experience prostress or much life satisfaction, whereas those who were actively involved in and had control over doing a meaningful action (making a new friend, learning a sport) reported prostress, a better quality of life and happiness.  Many other studies support such findings about the positive impact of prostress on life satisfaction, mood and even success.  The more prostress events, the better, found an earlier study by Larsen, Diener and Cropanzano in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.","67047566":"The next time you find yourself in what seems like a negative situation, ask yourself some important questions: Can I view this as a challenge and not a threat?

Hugging will give you these physical benefits plus the added emotional support that comes from connecting with someone you care about. For best results, try sharing a squeeze for around six seconds, the amount of time some research suggests is necessary to really harness the power of a hug.","06330b43":"Look for the Nearest Walking Trail","86f38bec":"Your home or office may feel like a breeding ground for dark thoughts. But you can actually walk your way to a happy place, say Canadian researchers. In a recent study, people were asked to think about a painful experience before heading out on an hour-long walk. By the time they returned their spirits had lifted. The idea is that nature is so distracting (and in many cases, beautiful and peaceful) that once you step out in it, it's actually pretty hard to hold onto negative thoughts. So, while you may start off in a bad mood, you'll forget about it as soon as you see a beautiful flower, or hear a bird chirping, or smell the cooking coming from your neighbor's kitchen. The best part about trying this on your own: You'll get the same boost in mood whether you head out for a hike in the woods or a walk around your neighborhood.","e7f6f76a":"Dress to Impress","161fb747":"Casual wear may equal comfort, but it's also the dress-code of the  depressed, say British scientists. To feel good fast, reach for the opposite type of apparel. According to one poll, a majority of women reach for a favorite dress on days they're feeling happy, so for an instant perk-up, put on a special occasion outfit. A quick glance in the mirror will help your mood improve.","07d4a539":"Smile","e5302e4e":"Smiling&mdash;even if it's a “fake” smile&mdash;can help improve your mood. That's because our brains are hardwired to associate the activation of the face's “smile muscles” with actual happiness. When you turn up the corners of your mouth your brain physiology will change and you'll automatically feel better, say researchers at DePauw University. Unhappy? Grin (even if you have to hold a pen between your teeth) and feel your bad mood slide away.","f1386e2d":"Listen to Justin Timberlake. Or Fun.

It can be either the music or the lyrics&mdash;studies found a mood-boosting effect with both classical music and upbeat music that had “happy” lyrics. But don't just crank up the volume and wait for the good feelings to waft in. In order to use music to change your mood you actually have to focus on becoming happy, say researchers at Penn State Shenango. Tell yourself that a certain song will do the trick, then let the tunes take over.","f7811965":"Do a Good Deed for Someone Else","e9aa19c2":"Help others to help yourself. That's the message behind heaps of research showing that people who regularly volunteer tend to report higher levels of happiness.

But only for a short while. If you're like most people, that new purchase eventually lost its luster. But are there certain ways we can spend our money that <em>will</em> bring us real happiness? To find out, we chatted with Harvard Business School professor Michael Norton, the co-author, along with psychologist Elizabeth Dunn, of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Money-Science-Smarter-Spending-ebook/dp/B008J4L17K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</em></a>.","23f206cd":"<strong>Michael Norton:</strong> First, our research shows that people believe that more income is associated with a lot more happiness: twice as much money, twice as happy.

Short of that, there are some very simple ways to get more happiness out of every experience you buy. First, make sure you pay for the vacation in full, up front. Nothing ruins a vacation more than feeling the entire time that an enormous bill is awaiting you when you’re done. Paying far enough in advance&mdash;with all expenses included – means that when the vacation finally comes, everything feels free. And there’s another advantage to paying far in advance: the months and months of exciting anticipation fantasizing in your narrow cubicle about those sunny beaches. Research shows that one of the biggest vacation-related happiness peaks comes <em>before</em> the vacation even begins.","bed5aad8":"<strong>Michael Norton:</strong> Despite the fact that <em>Happy Money</em> focuses on how to maximize your happiness bang for every buck you spend, there’s another critical action that leads not so much to happiness right now, but happiness down the road: saving. Saving is difficult in part because it does nothing for our happiness today&mdash;but wise saving can provide us with enormous happiness down the road. That said, we’d all probably want to spend at least a <em>little</em> of our millions.

Shifting our attention to others can trick our minds into forgetting our own little world, as we remember everyone else has their ups and downs too. Dacher Keltner, psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Born-Be-Good-Science-Meaningful/dp/0393337138\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Born To Be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life</em></a>, borrows the word <em>jen</em> from Confucius to describe the extent to which we bring out the best in other people and avoid bringing them down. Individuals with a high <em>jen</em> ratio are more likely to commit an act of kindness and compassion and less likely to use a derogatory remark than someone with a low <em>jen</em> ratio. And research by Sonja Lyubomirsky has shown that performing altruistic acts for others reliably increases positive emotions. So help a neighbor. Offer to buy a cup of coffee to the elderly man in line behind you. Take time to really listen to a friend’s problem and help them see the way through. Building them up will lift <em>your</em> mood up.","1bddf1bf":"Psychologist Robert Thayer and colleagues identified a number a strategies people use to self-regulate their moods. Physical activity and exercise, while not the most popular, proved to be the most effective. John J. Ratey, M.D., author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain</em></a>, argues that we evolved to move, and the health of our brains&mdash;and the moods our brains experience&mdash;rely on physical activity to stay healthy. Since it's hard to motivate ourselves to head out for a long run when we're in a bad mood, focus on small steps. Watch an aerobic video and commit to the first five minutes. Or put your shoes on and just walk. The effects of exercise can happen so quickly that you might decide to keep going once you’ve started. A bonus technique: move outside. Research by Richard Ryan and colleagues shows that being in nature significant increases our sense of vitality.","aab99989":"In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/1400078393\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life </em></a>, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman discusses the thinking styles that differentiate optimists from pessimists. When an adverse event happens, like receiving an unexpected bill in the mail, pessimists are likely to think of it as being permanent and pervasive. In other words, they say to themselves, “I’m always going to be behind on bills and my life sucks.” Optimists, on the other hand, are more likely to describe the event as temporary and to compartmentalize it. An optimist would say, “I’ll have to cut back for the next month to pay this off, but it will be OK, and at least I’m great at what I do for a living.” If your bad mood stems from a challenge or obstacle you’re dealing with, try to focus on the control you <em>do</em> have to change it, and be realistic about how much of your life it affects. And if all else fails, smile. It sounds almost too easy, but research by Robert Zajonc shows that the simple act of smiling can improve your mood. For the greatest effect, give yourself a big authentic smile by finding something that genuinely makes you laugh.","f8c5ee6e":"Build skills for lasting happiness through fun, science-based activities and games: Sign up for Happify today!","0fbb401a":"How to Make Friends and Be More Connected – How to Meet New People","964a07f0":"For many of us, making friends isn't easy.

Friends offer support in times of stress. They boost our optimism, confidence, and willingness to try new things, plus they’re great buffers against anxiety and depression. So here are three strategies for meeting new people and making new friends:","da906312":"Take a Smiling Walk","b9c0a842":"A great way to boost your social interaction experience is to take a \"smiling\" walk. The next time you go out, make a point to smile at others. Don't just smile at passerby–smile at your coworkers, the deli guy, or even the mailman. Smiling is a proactive behavior which solicits a reaction. Studies show that the more a person smiles during a conversation, the more friendly that person will be perceived to be, and the more favorable response that person will get from the receiving end.","ceb46cbd":"Meet Your Friends' Friends","84907d69":"One of the easiest ways to make new friends and expand your social circle is to meet your friends' friends. Researchers who study social networks observed the “triadic closure” – a phenomenon occurring between three people, let's say, A, B, and C. When strong ties exist between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C. This simple concept suggests that you have a much better chance developing strong friendships with your friend's friends, than with a random guy or a girl at the checkout lane. So why not ask your friend to invite one or two of their pals to join you on your next outing?","9af829ea":"Reach Out to a Potential Friend","ed47f164":"Is there someone at work you’d like to befriend but don’t know how? Is there a neighbor who once said “I’d love to have you over for a drink, sometime!” but never followed through? Try a simple gesture to break the ice. Treat them to a cup of coffee or offer to do them a helpful favor.  Studies show that people who spend money on other people and experiences are significantly happier than those who spend the money on themselves, especially if they're buying material objects. Scientists have also found that giving emotional support to others tends to support one’s own emotional health: To give is to experience relief, even for those who are struggling themselves.","d2e8489e":"For more strategies on how to meet new people and make new friends, plus personalized activities, games, and quizzes that will boost your happiness and help you apply these skills to your daily life, <a href=\"#modal\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">sign up for a free trial of Happify's \"Be More Socially Connected\" track</a>.","225846d0":"\"Studies show that the more a person smiles during a conversation, the more friendly that person will be perceived to be, and the more favorable response they'll get.\"","7308286c":"Your friend <a href=\"{{home_url}}/profile/{{friend_id}}\" style=\"color: #FF7A00; text-decoration: none;\">{{friend_name}}</a> has joined Happify!

Research shows that volunteering distracts us from our own thoughts and concerns; by focusing on others, we boost our mood and self-esteem, and feel a greater sense of purpose.","0c5a1f04":"For more strategies on embracing life as an empty nester, plus science-based, happiness-boosting activities and games, <a href=\"#modal\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">sign up for the \"Embrace Life as an Empty Nester\" track on Happify.</a> You'll learn how to maximize your happiness and make the most of your current stage in life.","4f86595e":"\"A study from the University of California, Berkeley found that women reported greater satisfaction with their marriages once their kids left home.\"","b23c94ba":"Benefits of Gratitude – Be More Grateful","4de29ad8":"Cultivate an Attitude of Gratitude","a044b49e":"Just what do grateful people have in common—and why is it worth practicing gratitude all year round?

However, many of the good feelings that bubble up on turkey day are a result of the holiday's emphasis on giving thanks. Thinking about all you have to appreciate can boost your happiness and your overall sense of well‑being, according to psychologists, which helps explain why Thanksgiving scores so high among American holidays. It's topped only by Christmas, according to one recent <a href='http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/878/Default.aspx' target='_blank'>poll</a>.","c6bd4a3b":"The Effects of Gratitude Last Longer Than You Think","55d3dfb6":"Feeling and expressing gratitude can make you happy in the moment—just think back to the joy you felt the last time a friend helped you out or your partner cooked a gourmet dinner—and a growing mound of evidence shows that giving thanks can also have a lasting effect on your mood. One study from the University of Pennsylvania found that people who wrote and delivered a heartfelt thank-you letter actually felt happier for a full <em>month</em> after, and the same researchers discovered that writing down three positive events each day for a week kept happiness levels high for up to six months.","adb07256":"Tools for Thankfulness","ac12d280":"So how can you cultivate a growing sense of gratitude—and its positive side-benefits—on your own? It turns out that the tools used by psychologists in research studies—namely a gratitude journal and some thank-you notes—are some of the best ones for boosting gratitude both in and out of the lab. By writing down positive things that happen to you and actively acknowledging those who have helped you, you become better at recognizing the good in your life, which naturally helps you feel more grateful and thankful more often. <a href=\"#modal\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">You can also find dozens of fun gratitude activities on Happify!</a>","a124d588":"What Grateful People Have in Common","c228cba4":"Of course, the actual goal isn't to have a notebook full of your declarations of gratitude, but rather to make gratitude a default feeling.

Here's why.","ecc66d00":"Hedonic Adaptation: Why We Get Used to the Good Stuff (and the Bad)","a9c62db4":"The majority of research around changing our happiness levels revolves around a concept called <em>hedonic adaptation</em>. It sounds like a mouthful, but you'll get the idea right away: Hedonic adaptation is when something good or bad happens to you and, with the passage of time, you get used to it. For example, imagine your first big breakup. At the time, it might have seemed like the world was going to end, but today, you’ve moved on, and chances are it doesn’t affect you much anymore. You can thank hedonic adaptation for that! Unfortunately, hedonic adaptation also applies to positive events, like moving into a new home that you love. The beautiful view out of your bedroom window, the pool you were so thrilled about, or whatever else made the experience of moving exciting eventually becomes your everyday reality. Research finds that hedonic adaptation happens with the majority of good and bad things that happen to us in our daily lives.","5c9f680c":"Why? Adaptation is a system that exists in the body to help maintain balance. Anything intense that happens to you&mdash;good or bad, your body doesn’t know the difference&mdash;puts you into “stress mode,” and when your body is stressed, it puts off important basic functions (like digesting and healing) in favor of functions that would help you escape mortal danger. People who are chronically stressed have all sorts of problems because their bodies don't have time to take care of themselves. Similarly, if you walked around all day long, ecstatic about your new car, your body would never get a break. Therefore, when it comes to everyday stress, your body’s number one priority is to get you back to “neutral” to keep your stress levels down. It looks at an event and, after it’s excited you a few times, says “Oh yeah, I know what that is, I don’t need to get all worked up about it.”","210aec7f":"How to Make Happiness Last","dd9cea3d":"I’ve argued that the body inevitably goes back to “normal,” so how, then, is it possible to lastingly increase your own happiness? Recent research has come up with several important habits that can help to make happiness last.","0c79497c":"#1 <em>Aim for calm and contentment.</em>","2f9f4e75":"While it's impossible (and from a physical standpoint, actually undesirable) for you to maintain the level of excitement you feel when a positive event first happens, you can transform your initial “activated” feelings  (like joy and enthusiasm) into more “deactivated” emotions (like calm and contentment) that are easier and healthier to sustain.","a7af8cc1":"#2 <em>Mix it up, constantly.</em>","8327337c":"When you find a <a href=\"/public/articles/the-5-skills-that-will-increase-your-happiness/\">happiness-boosting technique</a> that works for you, try and change up how you do it each time. Let’s say, for example, that savoring works really well for you. Sadly, you can only savor the exact same piece of chocolate cake so many times before you get bored of it, so you'd want to find new and different things to savor, in different locations, with different people. The same is true for gratitude. If you meditate on your gratitude for the same person every day, you'll get weary of it, and the exercise will stop working. When you do gratitude activities, be sure to rotate the things or people you think about so the activity continues to work as best as possible. It’s also a good idea to do more than one type of activity, rather than focusing on just one. <a href=\"#modal\" class=\"js-start_quiz\">(Happify, with its diversity of activities for different life situations, helps you do just that!)</a> A recent study found that happiness app users who used several different activities benefited more than people who spent the same amount of time, but only on one activity.","d6b478fc":"#3 <em>Focus your attention on people and experiences, not physical possessions.</em>","2fb611b2":"A classic study found that while there are many different roads to happiness, every single one of those roads involves other people. This makes sense when you think about what we just talked about in #2&mdash;mixing it up. Hedonic adaptation happens when you do something the same way every time. A fancy new watch, for example, just sits on your wrist&mdash;there’s no way to make it any more or less exciting than it is. People, on the other hand, are different every time you interact with them, so it’s much harder to adapt to them, especially if you change up the things you do with them. While it's certainly possible to get in a rut with someone&mdash;for example, going to the same restaurant and ordering the same thing, week after week&mdash;there are also countless possibilities when it comes to new ways to experience a person.

Athletes who lost limbs but went on to compete again. Survivors of 9/11 who rebuilt from the rubble. Holocaust victims who are living out long, fulfilling lives. Look to your own community for inspiration. You likely know someone who once dealt with something terrible but has found joy again. In fact, researchers have found that resilience in the face of adversity is more common than uncommon.","83d949ca":"So, what does it mean to be resilient? \"Resilience is a measurement of one's capacity to recover fully from an adversity,\" says Charles Figley, PhD, director of the Tulane Traumatology Institute in New Orleans, where he studies traumatic stress resilience. \"It's like pressing a balloon tightly and examining how completely the balloon assumes its original position.\" Psychologists say that resilience can be learned&mdash;it's not something we either have or don't have. So if times are tough right now, you can take steps to strengthen your resilience. Even if you're not struggling at the moment, adopting these habits now can help you down the road when life throws you a curveball.","742cad53":"Expect Things to Get Better","b6d5bc8d":"If you fall into a rough patch, you may not feel happy the next day. Or even the next week. But eventually, with time, light will begin to peek back into your life. If you want to work on bouncing back, you must expect that good things will happen, says Phyllis Zilkha, PhD, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan. \"If you're expecting only bad things to happen, how resilient can you be? Why push on? What's the difference?\" Optimism, Zilkha says, is the single biggest factor in recovering from adversity. It's what makes some of us seek out solutions to our troubles instead of pulling the covers over our heads.","11556edc":"Don't Ignore Your Calls and Emails","0cf8b2d6":"There's no shortage of reasons why having a support system helps us get through tough times. Friends and loved ones can provide an invaluable distraction from our negative thoughts. When we're feeling isolated, they remind us that we're attached to a group—and that we're important to someone. They can also provide a fresh perspective: \"If they're not in the middle of the grief or the difficult period, people outside it can see a broader picture and say, ‘Yes, what's going on now is terrible, but look at this possible positive outcome,'\" Zilkha says. \"Social support is among the ‘protective factors' that increase our odds of having high resilience when faced with daunting adversity,\" Figley adds. \"It enables processing of the experience to focus on solutions.\"","61ab0a3f":"Go On a Mind Vacation","5699eec9":"Although it's natural for your mind to turn over events in your head, getting a break from negative thoughts can be restorative and healing, and keeping yourself busy can give you some much-needed distance from your troubles. Work is a time-honored way of recovering from pain—you're getting paid to focus and produce, so you won't be able to think about your problems as much. Or volunteer, which shifts your focus from yourself to others and could even help you see your troubles in a new light. One study at Vanderbilt University found that volunteering reduces depression and enhances happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and our sense of control over our lives. Try spending some time engaged in a hobby that you can lose yourself in. These moments when you're not focused on your pain or loss can create an opportunity for joy to sprout again.","31920ad2":"Tickle Your Funny Bone","1dcd3870":"When Figley looked at what makes emergency first responders resilient to traumatic stress, humor emerged as one of the most important protective factors. Humor dampens down our natural fight-or-flight reaction to negative events and lowers our stress hormones. It also shifts our perception of a difficult situation from an emergency to a less distressing issue, so we can calm down, look at it from different angles and cope with it better. \"When you feel that you have done the best you can in addressing questions like ‘Why did this happen to me?', take a break and experience something that makes you laugh,\" Figley says. It will not only help you feel better in the moment, but allow you to adapt to the reality you're faced with.","7e6efa51":"Count Your Blessings","c330486b":"<span style=\"color:#5F8DEB;\">{{from_name}}</span><span style=\"color:#777;\">replied to your compliment card on Happify:</span>","8a604f94":"Feeling grateful—something we can actively work on—improves our overall wellbeing and helps us cope with our troubles. In one study, people who created a list of five things they were grateful for over the past week felt better about their lives as a whole and were more optimistic about their expectations for the upcoming week than those who recorded hassles from the past week. The happiness-boosting benefits of thankfulness even helped people living with a difficult health condition. Study participants with a neuromuscular disease felt better about their lives and more connected to other people after they wrote a gratitude list than those who didn't count their blessings.","8e2f155c":"Finally, Remember That This, Too, Shall Pass","56d4d2db":"Try reminding yourself of this when you're feeling low. Because it's true! \"Everything in life has a beginning and end,\" Zilkha says. These endings may not be the best outcomes you can imagine, but they can bring some relief. For example, if you've gotten a serious diagnosis, you'll probably feel panicked and distraught. That feeling will subside a bit when you learn about treatments and start working toward getting better. If you're going through a divorce, you won't miss your ex as keenly a year or two down the line. \"When something bad is happening, it's like being in the middle of the ocean,\" Zilkha says. \"When you're there you think it just goes on forever, but it doesn't. I'm no believer that everything will turn out wonderful, but things <em>can</em> be better than they are now.\"","b21cefa6":"Thank You!","f27ed8d9":"I'm in schock","62103a93":"For science-based activities and games that build resilience, boost optimism, and increase your well‑being, sign up for Happify today!","04c636a3":"Each time this card is passed along, you will receive an email to notify you where the chain reaction is in the world and the difference being made.","f1dab9d0":"Psychologists say that resilience can be learned—it's not something we either have or don't have.","2fcf33be":"be more resilient","04b852dc":"Need More Time?","4ff6239c":"It looks like your time's up for working on the activities in your track part.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n                                                But don't stress!

Research shows that people tend to be optimistic by nature, but what if you're naturally more of an Eeyore? Strengthen your sense of hope: The trick is to <em>act</em> like an optimistic person, even if you aren't feeling particularly hopeful. \"If you think that the future can be positive, you're more willing to put in time and energy to make that come about,\" says Segerstrom. By being engaged and persistent, even if you don't feel particularly positive, the benefits of optimism—like satisfaction and health&mdash;will soon follow.

The study will also examine how people with psoriasis use Claro. Results of this study will help us decide whether to offer Claro to more psoriasis patients and determine ways we can improve the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What do you need to do to be in the study?</h1>\r\n<p>You will use the Claro (a premium version of the Happify app) and complete several 2-3 minute surveys about living with psoriasis. The surveys will become available in the app today, two days from now, and every two weeks after that. The app also includes surveys that monitor how your happiness and emotions change every two weeks. The information collected in the course of this study is referred to as “Data.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How will your information be used and what is the legal basis?</h1>\r\n<p>Your Data, including your responses to in-app assessments and usage data, will be used for research to understand how people with psoriasis use and respond to the app. It will remain confidential to Happify Health and Almirall. Your Data will be password-protected and will only be used by researchers on the study team. The Data used for research will not include any identifying information (like your email address), so you will remain anonymous.</p>\r\n<p>However, if you are using a medicine made by Almirall and you report any side effects or complaints, Happify Health or Almirall will review the information you reported. In this case, your identifying information may be retrieved so that a representative can contact you to ask more about your concerns in order to learn more about the safety of Almirall’s medicines.</p>\r\n<p>The legal basis for the processing your Personal Data is your explicit consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How long will this study last and how long will your data be stored?</h1>\r\n<p>This study will end, meaning that we will stop collecting your Data for this purpose, on May 31, 2022. If you want to be removed from the study earlier, you can contact Happify Health at support@happify.com or simply stop using the app. Your Data will be retained until August 31, 2022 so that we can summarize the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What are your rights?</h1>\r\n<p>Even if you agree to participate in the study, you can change your mind. To withdraw consent for your Data to be used, email support@happify.com. You can read more about your rights and how your data will be protected and used in Happify's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

The information that we collect through your use of our Apps and tools will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. When you download and install one of our mobile Apps onto your mobile device, we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore, the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use our mobile device Apps. Because some of the content on our mobile device Apps directs your mobile device to our website you will be exposed to the Cookies that we use and to third party Cookies that may be contained in advertisements that we do not control and will be unable to delete any of these Cookies with your mobile device. Therefore, if you do not want to be exposed to Cookies when you use your mobile device you should not use our mobile device Apps and you should set your mobile device to reject Cookies when you use our mobile optimized sites. Our use of Cookies and Web Beacons on our mobile optimized sites are similar to our use on our desktop sites. Your choices to reject Cookies are available on our mobile optimized site.

When Members make Personal Information available to us, their Personal Information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Information offline). The privacy of your Personal Information is very important to us. When our registration process asks users to submit Personal Information (if any), and when we transmit such Personal Information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the appropriate current industry standard software that employs state-of-the-art, best-practice encryption methods and algorithms.</p>
                                        <p class="terms">Access to your Personal Information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your Personal Information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store Personal Information in are kept in a secure physical environment.

Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law.

                                        <div class="terms">A Member may request payment equal to the cash balance of your Member account only as permitted by these Terms and Conditions. Redeeming your cash balance and receipt of any corresponding payment by you is contingent upon: <ol type="decimal"><li>your full compliance with these Terms and Conditions;</li><li>our receipt of your request to convert the cash balance in your Member account to a payment,</li><li>your establishing an account with PayPal to receive your payment, and</li><li>your compliance with the specific rules and terms then in effect for the particular reward program.</li></ol></div>
                                        <div class="terms">A Member may use only one Member account to participate in a cash reward program.  Under no circumstances may a Member attempt to establish multiple accounts using multiple computers, names, or any program that masks the Member’s identity. All cash rewards are subject to review. Happify reserves the right to withhold, deny or cancel any cash rewards and/or terminate your Account if Happify, in its sole discretion, deems any cash rewards as fraudulent, abusive, unethical, suspicious or otherwise inconsistent with our cash rewards program terms, this Agreement or any other applicable law or regulation. For avoidance of doubt, faking completion of activities on Happify for cash rewards, will be disqualified from participation in the cash rewards program and their Account will be terminated. Happify decisions are final. <ol type="a"><li>Minimum Cash Request Amount<br/>NO REDEMPTION OF CASH BALANCE UNTIL YOU HAVE AT LEAST TEN DOLLARS POSTED TO YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT ($10.00) (the “minimum payment amount”). The terms “cash,” “dollars,” and similar terms are used interchangeably in this document and throughout our Services. Cash posted to your account is unearned and you have no right to redeem the “cash” in your account, and we have no liability or obligation to pay you, unless and until the amount posted to your account meets at least the minimum payment amount and you have otherwise complied with these Terms and Conditions. The “cash” in your account has no cash value and may be cancelled at any time pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.</li><li>Requesting Payment/Required Account<br/>You can request payment of the cash balance in your Member account, subject to these Terms and Conditions, by clicking the “Request Payment” link located on the Cash Reward page and completing all additional steps relating to verification of information and completion of request. As noted above, you may not request payment and the Cash in your account (which has no actual cash value) until at least the Minimum Payment Amount is posted to your account and the conditions herein are otherwise satisfied. A link to request payment will be displayed. Currently, the Minimum Payment Amount required when requesting a payment is $10.00; however, we reserve the right to change this amount. Members may have only one pending payment request at a time.<br/>If a Member is eligible for a cash reward program, the Member will be responsible for establishing an account with PayPal.  Happify™ will make payments to the PayPal account.  Members are responsible for establishing a PayPal account and assuring that it is secure and reliable. Members must establish their own account.  Happify™ will not make payments to third party accounts.  Members should read and understand PayPal’s terms and rules.  The same PayPal account cannot be used to claim a prize for multiple Member Accounts.  Happify™ is not responsible for any actions taken by PayPal once payment has been made.</li><li>Payment Schedule<br/>Requests to process payment will be processed within ten (10) business days after the request is received. Happify™ does not permit more than one (1) payment request to be pending at any given time.<br/>All payment requests are inspected immediately prior to processing. Payment requests made by inactive Members will not be processed. Accounts found to be in violation of these terms will have accounts closed and any payment request cancelled.</li><li>Lost Payments<br/>Happify™ is not responsible for any lost payments and will not replace payments allegedly converted or improperly accessed by third parties so long as such payment was sent to the PayPal account or email address provided to us when you signed up or provided to us at the time such payment was processed. If a payment that is processed for a Member is rejected due to an error in processing, we will re-send the payment after the Member provides us with accurate PayPal account information.  We reserve the right to cancel a payment if rejected more than once or if we have reason to believe any of our terms have been violated.<br/>You are responsible for usage of your account, whether or not authorized, including your log in, password and account information.  Any violation of these terms or of site usage may result in the closure of your account and loss of eligibility to receive payments.</li><li>Tax Matters<br/>You are responsible for all tax liability arising from your receipt of payments under Happify™’s cash rewards program.  We will require you to provide necessary tax information about yourself prior to receiving payment when requesting payment greater than $300 at one time or cumulatively during a calendar year. Happify™ will file a 1099 tax form with respect to any Member who earns $600 or more in one calendar year.</li><li>Termination<br/>Happify™ reserves the right to terminate the cash rewards program at any time, provided that if the Member has met the criteria and earned the cash rewards prior to termination of the program, the Member will be paid notwithstanding the termination of the program.  Happify™ makes no guarantees regarding the number or dollar amount of cash rewards it will issue over the life of any cash reward program.</li></ol></div>
