			<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
			<p>This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by Drop Download , (&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) with respect to your access and use of Drop Download &apos;s online file storage and sharing service located at www.drop.download , (the &quot;Service&quot;), so you can make an informed decision about using the Service.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.</p>
			<p><strong>What Is Personal Information?</strong></p>
			<p>As used in this Policy, the term &quot;personally identifiable information&quot; means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include &quot;aggregate&quot; information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
			<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
			<p>Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, social network data and performance related data. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.</p>
			<p>Passive Collection: Passive Collection: When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of &quot;cookies&quot; when you use the Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information.

However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.</p>
			<p>The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
			<p>We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service and in our Apps. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers&rsquo; personally identifiable information. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. Such technologies are used to collect aggregate statistics related to usage of the Service and do not collect personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information will be stored on secured servers, and we may store and process personally identifiable information in the United States and other countries.</p>
