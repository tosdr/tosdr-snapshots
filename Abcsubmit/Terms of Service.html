<td>These AbcSubmit.com Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”), together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our services and features as presented on the AbcSubmit.com website(s) (“AbcSubmit Website”, and collectively – the “AbcSubmit Terms”), all set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to each visitor or user (“User” our “you”) of the AbcSubmit Website, and/or any other services, applications and features offered by us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the AbcSubmit Website, collectively – the “AbcSubmit Services” or “Services”).</p>

<h3>1.3. User account</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>In order to access and use certain sections and features of the AbcSubmit Services, you must first register and create an account with AbcSubmit (“User Account”).</p>
<p>If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the AbcSubmit Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.</p>
<p>Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust &#8211; as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.</p>
<p>You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the AbcSubmit Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us.</p>
<p>In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.</p>
<ol>
<li>AbcSubmit will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant AbcSubmit Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in AbcSubmit’s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.</li>
<li>If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the www.whois.net website or on AbcSubmit’s database, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, AbcSubmit will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, AbcSubmit shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the AbcSubmit Account as the owner of the User Platform.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the forgoing, AbcSubmit shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event AbcSubmit deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by AbcSubmit.</li>
</ol>
</td>
<td>To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.</p>
<p>You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.</p>
<p>All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.</p>
<p>The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company’s), and be accurate and complete.</p>
<p>When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account.</td>

<h3>5.3. Subscription Auto-Renewals</h3>

<td>In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services, certain Paid Services include an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless you turn-off the auto-renewal option, such Paid Services will automatically renew upon the end of the applicable subscription period, for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period (excluding extended periods).</p>
<p>For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Accordingly, where applicable, AbcSubmit will attempt to automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with AbcSubmit, within two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice. If your Paid Service is subject to a yearly or multiple-year subscription period, AbcSubmit will endeavor to provide you a notice prior to the renewal of such Paid Service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.</p>
<p>You may turn-off the auto-renewal option or cancel your Paid Services at any time via your User Account by migrating to a Free paid plan.</p>
<p>Certain domains are subject to a different renewal policy as detailed in the Domains Registration Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the AbcSubmit Services you use (whether or not such AbcSubmit Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals).
