    </h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Cloze!
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    These terms and conditions are a legal agreement (these “Terms”) between
    you (together with the business entity, if any, that you represent, “you”
    or “your” or “User”) and Cloze, Inc. (“Cloze” or “we”, “us” or “our”),
    establishing terms and conditions under which you shall access and use the
    services and features (“Services”) available on Cloze’s web-based platform
    (the “Cloze Platform”). The Cloze Platform is located at    <a href="https://www.cloze.com">https://www.cloze.com</a> and any
    related sub-domains (the “Website(s)”) and provided through such Website
    and through tools and services or through downloadable mobile applications,
    web browser extensions, add-ins, chat bots, or other applications (“Apps”)
    made available by Cloze from time to time. The date you first agree to
    these Terms is referred to herein as the “Effective Date.” Your use of the
    Cloze Platform is also subject to our Privacy Policy available on our
    Website at
    <a href="https://www.cloze.com/app/legal/privacy">
        https://www.cloze.com/app/legal/privacy
    </a>
    and updated from time to time (“Privacy Policy”).
</p>
<p>
    Cloze organizes and provides efficient means to access, use, and change information
    regarding your email, notes, files, reminders,
    calendar, phone, messaging, contacts, social media and other content,
    from your accounts (“Accounts”) with various third party platforms that we
    enable on the Cloze Platform from time to time (“Third Party Platforms”), such
    as Microsoft 365, Gmail, Google Workspace, Slack, Docusign, Dropbox, Evernote,
    and similar platforms as you may authorize in connection with your use of the
    Close Platform.

    You may register for our Services
    individually or as a member of a team (“Team”) established by you or a
    third party through our Services. If you are registering for our Services
    as the organizer of a Team, you represent, warrant and covenant that you
    will have the consent of any individuals prior to providing their
    information to Cloze or inputting such information to the Cloze Platform.
</p>
<p>
    BEFORE YOU CLICK ON THE “I ACCEPT” OR SIMILAR BUTTON OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE CLOZE
    PLATFORM, WEBSITES, APPS OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES, CAREFULLY READ THESE
    TERMS. BY CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” OR SIMILAR BUTTON OR ACCESSING THE CLOZE
    PLATFORM, WEBSITE OR APPS OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AND THE BUSINESS
    ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A
    PARTY TO THESE TERMS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY

    PLATFORM AND/OR THE SERVICES FROM YOU ARE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO
    NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN DO NOT CLICK “I ACCEPT” AND YOU WILL
    NOT BE PERMITTED TO ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SERVICES.
</p>
<h2>1. Registration</h2>
<p>
    Some portions of our Services may be available to users without
    registering, other features will only be available to those users who
    register with us, while still other features will only be available to
    users based on the features included in their tier of subscription plan or
    trial of our Services. In consideration of your use of the Service, you
    agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you
    as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Service (“Registration
    Data”); (b) maintain the security of your password and identification; (c)
    maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other
    information you provide to us, to keep it accurate, current and complete;
    and (d) be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any
    actions that take place using your account. If you are registered to use
    our Services as a member of a Team, certain of your content will
    automatically be shared with other members of such team, as described in
    our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>2. Restricted License</h2>
<p>
    On the condition that you comply with all your obligations under these
    Terms, Cloze hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    restricted license (without the right to sublicense) to access the Cloze
    Platform and use the Services in accordance with these Terms and the
    instructions and guidelines posted on the Cloze Platform. Cloze reserves
    the rights to terminate your license to use the Cloze Platform and Services
    at any time and for any reason or to change the features included in
    different tiers of paid or free subscription plans. You may not use the
    Services to substantially replicate products or services offered by Cloze
    including the republication of Cloze content or the creation of a separate
    relationship management platform. If Cloze believes, in its sole
    discretion, that you have violated or attempted to violate these Terms,
    your ability to use and access the Services may be temporarily or
    permanently revoked, with or without notice.
</p>
<p>
    Cloze reserves the right to investigate possible violations of these Terms,
    block users from accessing the Services, and refer matters to law
    enforcement authorities for further investigation. We may disclose
    information to third parties, in accordance with our Privacy Policy,
    located at /app/legal/privacy.
</p>
<p>
    You agree that if Cloze determines or reasonably suspects that you are
    reselling or brokering the Services or any information, programs, computer
    applications, or data available through the Services,

    or is otherwise violating any provision of these
    Terms, Cloze may take immediate action, including terminating your access
    to the Services. Cloze reserves the right to use
    whatever means it deems appropriate to monitor your compliance with these
    Terms. Cloze reserves the right to exercise whatever lawful means it deems
    necessary to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services,
    including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and
    contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized
    use.
</p>
<p>
    You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is
    subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the
    U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not
    listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
</p>
<h2>3. Your Content</h2>
<p>
    In order to use some features of the Services, you may choose to provide us
    with information, or access to information, to create and automatically
    update your Cloze account, such as email, notes, files, reminders,
    calendar, phone, messaging, contacts, social media and other content
    (collectively, “your content”). You own your content and may request
    deletion of your content at any time, unless you have shared your content
    with others and they have not deleted it, or it was copied or stored by
    other users while displayed by you to others through the Services, as
    further described in our Privacy Policy. In order to host your information
    within the Service and provide the associated benefits of using the
    Service, you grant us and our service providers a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    transferrable right to copy, modify and use your content to provide the
    Services subject to our Privacy Policy. Cloze requires these rights in
    order to create and update your Cloze account, host your content, and
    provide you with the Services. You may also provide us with your login
    credentials for your Accounts at Third Party Platforms (“Third Party Login
    Credentials”). You hereby authorize us to utilize those Third Party Login
    Credentials to access your Accounts at the applicable Third Party Platforms and
    incorporate your content, from those Third Party Platforms
    into your content in our Services. You represent and warrant that you have
    the right to provide us with those Third Party Login Credentials and your content and to permit us to use and
    disclose your content within the parameters authorized by these Terms or
    our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    You, and not Cloze, are responsible for maintaining and protecting a
    separate permanent record of all of your content, if you wish to retain
    your content. Cloze does not guarantee that your content will be retained
    in our Services and Cloze shall not be liable for any loss or corruption of your
    content, or for backing up or restoring any of your content.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms or otherwise, Cloze may
    monitor your use of the Services and Cloze Platform and use data and
    information related to your content and your use of the Services in an
    aggregate or de-identified manner, including to compile statistical and
    performance information related to the provision and operation of the Cloze
    Platform and Services. You agree that Cloze may make such data and
    information publicly available and use such information to the extent and
    in the manner required by applicable law or regulation and/or for purposes
    of data gathering, analysis, service enhancement and marketing, provided
    that such data and information does not identify you or any other
    individual or company.
</p>

    additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Cloze disclaims any
    responsibility for any harm resulting from the use of the Cloze Platform by
    you, your other Team members or any other third party.

    control over those non-Cloze websites and web pages and is not responsible
    for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Cloze website or
