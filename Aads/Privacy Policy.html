<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>USER CONTENT</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>As described in our T&amp;Cs, some Services may enable you to provide User Materials on or through our Services. When you post or publish User Materials on our Services, any information in the User Materials (including information in images or videos) becomes publicly accessible on our Services (and may also be indexed by and accessible through third-party search engines). Other Users and we may access and use the User Materials as described in our T&amp;Cs. This applies even if you or someone else also provides such information to us by other means. Our use of such information might have been more limited under this Policy if such information was only provided to us by other means. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the right to share any information about others that you may share with us or with others through our Services.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>USER COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Connecting with Publishers: We aim to provide a platform where Users can discover and engage with a wide range of Publishers worldwide. Advertisers may target ad units upon applying to use the AADS services.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Sharing Information with Other Users: currently, AADS.com does not facilitate communication between users via the AADS platform. However, some information is available publicly, such as the statistics of specific campaigns and ad units.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>TO WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Personal Information. Under this Policy, &quot;Personal Information&quot; means information that by itself can be used to identify or contact a specific person (for example, username, e-mail address, and/or your public cryptocurrency wallet address), and Personal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous so that by itself it no longer identifies and can no longer reasonably be used to contact a specific person. In certain circumstances, Personal Information may also include information you voluntarily provide to us. We will not share your Personal Information with others other than in the ways described in this Policy or otherwise without your prior consent. In addition to the other sharing of Personal Information described in this Policy, we may share your Personal Information with others in the following contexts.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Service Providers: We may contract with third-party service providers that help us provide our Services or perform services for us related to them. They may process your Personal Information as necessary to perform those functions for us. Examples may include but are not limited to: identity verification, document authentication, public database review, payment processing, bill collection, fraud investigation, e-mail, and postal mail administration, customer service assistance, web and mobile data analytics, display ads, and server and database hosting services. To avoid doubt, we do not sell your Personal Information to our Service Providers.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Transactions: We may use third-party cryptocurrency wallet extensions to conduct cryptocurrency transactions. The applicable privacy policies govern your interactions with third-party cryptocurrency wallet extensions.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>For conducting certain cryptocurrency transactions, we use third-party cryptocurrency payment processors such as Coinpayments.net; your interactions with Coinpayments.net are governed by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.coinpayments.net/help-privacy">Coinpayments.net privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>If there are any errors you may make when using third-party cryptocurrency payment processors (such as sending the wrong cryptocurrency to a specific cryptocurrency standard wallet address), we may communicate directly with third-party cryptocurrency payment processors to ensure we receive your payment. You hereby authorize us to communicate with third-party cryptocurrency payment processors to solve any cryptocurrency payment errors on your behalf.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Business Transfers: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be one of the assets transferred. In this event, we will inform the AADS Users about a change of ownership of their Personal Information by updating this document or announcing it on the AADS website or through the AADS social media channels.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Legal Purposes: We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and/or other information if we believe that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request (such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders), which may include responding to legal requests; (ii) enforce our T&amp;Cs or our other policies or agreements with Users, or investigate potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) protect or enforce the rights or property of AADS, you, or any other person or entity; or (v) prevent physical harm to any person, including situations involving possible violence or self-harm.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>AGGREGATED AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>We may aggregate and/or make anonymous any Personal Information that we have obtained in any way from or about you or others so that such information no longer contains any Personal Information. We may use and share any aggregated, anonymous, or other non-personally identifying information for any legitimate business purposes, including research and development, marketing, and to inform others about how our Services or Content are engaged with or used.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Our Services may include links to other websites or services we do not own or control, and other websites or services that we do not own or control may contain links to our Services. Our Services may also include features that enable you to link your AADS account to your account on other social media services. For example, you may be able to sign up for (or sign in to) our Services through another social media service. Our Services may also include features that enable you to share Content on other websites and social media services. However, these links and features are not an endorsement by us of any other websites or services or any of their privacy policies or practices. When you visit or use other websites or services, they may collect information from you, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of other websites and services that you visit or use to be informed of their practices.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>INTERNATIONAL PROCESSING</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>AADS is headquartered in Hong Kong. Our Users, service providers, and other third parties you may interact with in connection with our Services, may be located in different countries around the world, including countries that may not offer the same level of protection for Personal Information as that offered in Hong Kong. By accessing or using our Services in Hong Kong or any other country or jurisdiction, you agree that your information may be transferred and processed in Hong Kong and any other country or jurisdiction.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Our Services are not directed to anyone under 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from people in this age group. If you believe we may have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18, please get in touch with us.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>SECURITY</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Every AADS account is protected to help maintain privacy and security on our Services. If you register for an account, we urge you to use a strong password containing unique numbers, letters, and special characters and to protect the confidentiality of your password at all times. If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or password, you agree to immediately notify us and change your password. We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your Personal Information. While no system is entirely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the site reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures to protect our user database, and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains your responsibility:</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the site and/or Services;</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>To ensure no one else uses the Site and/or Services while your device is logged on to the site (including by logging on to your device through a mobile, Wi-Fi, or shared access connection you are using);</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>To log off or exit from the Site and/or Services when not using it;</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Where relevant, keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and login details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access, for example, over a network; and</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>To maintain excellent internet security.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>It would be best if you kept all of your account details secure. If you think that any of your accounts have been compromised, you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular, make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as possible so we can try to help you keep your account secure and, if necessary, warn anyone else who could be affected.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Please note that while we seek to protect your information and maintain the security of our Services, due to the possibility of hardware or software failure, unauthorized entry or use, and other factors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information, whether online or offline. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. Please also note that any information you provide to us via e-mail is unencrypted.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>STATUTORY REQUESTS</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Some jurisdictions have laws that give people the right to access or correct the Personal Information which a company has about them. We will honour any statutory right you may have to access or correct your Personal Information in our records, and you can e-mail such requests via <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://a-ads.com/contact_us">https://a-ads.com/contact_us</a>. Once we receive your request, we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfil your request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject unreasonably repetitive requests that would require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an existing practice), would jeopardise the privacy of others, or would be highly impractical to fulfil (for example, requests to access information located on backup systems).</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>As this Policy is part of our T&amp;Cs, any disputes involving you and us that relate to privacy or the use of your information and that arise out of or are associated with this Policy or our Services will be subject to our T&amp;Cs, including any provisions regarding the limitation of damages and liability, choice of law, and dispute resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Our business changes with time, and our Privacy Policy will change also. We reserve the right to change this Policy, without prior notice, at any time at our sole discretion. For example, without limitation, we may change this Policy to reflect changes to the law or our Services. All changes to this Policy will be effective when posted on our Services or at a later date as may be specified in the updated Policy. We will notify you of any changes to this Policy by posting the updated Policy on our Services. You agree to review this Policy regularly and inform yourself of all applicable changes. By continuing to use our Services after any changes to this Policy become effective, you agree to such changes and the updated Policy. Unless we notify you otherwise, the current version of this Policy will apply to all information we have about you or your account.</p>
</div>
<div class='text-block'>
<h2 class='text-block__title'>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
<p class='text-block__text'>Cookies, Web Beacons, Google ReCAPTCHA, and Similar Technologies: We may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, and similar technologies, such as tracking URLs, to collect information about how you or others access or engage with our Services, Content, e-mails, and ads displayed on or off our Services, and to operate, develop, improve, and customize our Services, Content, and marketing, including ads displayed on or off our Services. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may have settings that enable you to decline or delete cookies on your device. Please note that if you refuse cookies, you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of our Services, as some of our Services require cookies to operate.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>What these Technologies Are: &quot;Cookies&quot; are small data files placed on your computer or other devices which record information. For example, a cookie could enable our Services to recognize your browser, while another cookie could store your account preferences and other information to help make our Services more customized. We may use two kinds of cookies, &quot;session cookies&quot; and &quot;persistent cookies.&quot; Session cookies typically expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or are deleted. &quot;Web beacons&#39; (also known as &quot;pixel tags&quot; or &quot;clear GIFS&quot;) are pieces of code or pixels embedded in a web page or e-mail to track engagement with and responses to e-mails, web pages, or ads or to access or communicate with cookies. &quot;Tracking URLs&quot; are special URLs that can be used to track engagement with and responses to e-mails or web pages.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Third-Party Analytics, Service, and Ad Providers: We may use third-party analytics and services providers who help us better understand how our Services and Content are accessed and used, including for web analytics, audience measurement, personalization, segmentation, and relationship management purposes. In turn, this information helps us to develop and improve our Services and Content. Our third-party analytics and service providers include but are not limited to Google Analytics. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information about how Users access or engage with our Services, Content, e-mails, and ads on or off our Services. For more information about how Google may collect and process information in connection with Google Analytics and Google, click here.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>We may also use third-party advertising providers, including ad networks or exchanges, to help display ads on our Services or other websites, including customized ads based on past online activity. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to help provide services to us and collect information about your and others&#39; online activity across different websites. These providers may also collect your IP address, device identifier, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The third-party advertising providers we use include but are not limited to Google Analytics. We use its Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting features, which enable Google Analytics to collect data about the traffic on our Services through Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. We and third-party providers, including Google reCAPTCHA and Google Analytics, may use first-party cookies (i.e., cookies set by the website you are visiting) and third-party cookies (i.e., cookies placed by a third-party website other than the website you are visiting) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Services. We do not control the practices of any third-party providers. This Cookie Policy (and our Privacy Policy in general) does not cover using cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by any third parties.</p>
<p class='text-block__text'>Opting-Out: Third-party providers may offer a way to opt-out of receiving cookies from them by visiting their websites or the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance. For example, you may opt out of receiving ad-related cookies from Google through its Ad Settings. If you opt out of receiving cookies from one of these providers, it may place a cookie on your device to remember your preference. Accordingly, if you delete cookies, install a new browser, or start using a new device, you may need to repeat the opt-out process. For more information about AdChoice, please visit their website.
