The Terms govern all use of the Rover Service, whether you access it from our website at https://www.rover.com (including any subdomain or localized version) (the “</span><b>Site</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”), our mobile applications and mobile websites</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, our Facebook application, our online or phone support offerings, or any other access point we make available to you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/guarantee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover Guarantee Terms</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://store.rover.com/pages/terms-conditions"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover Store Terms and Conditions</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/reservation-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reservation Protection Policy</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and other Policies applicable to your use of the Rover Service are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS DURING THE ACCOUNT SIGN-UP PROCESS OR ACCESSING OR USING THE ROVER SERVICE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM, IN WHICH CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE ROVER SERVICE.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">You understand and agree that we may change the Terms from time to time, and that any such changes will be effective (except as otherwise described in Section 17.10 below) when we post the modified Terms on the Rover Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Your continued access and use of the Rover Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><b>2. Rover Service.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2.1 Nature of the Rover Service</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Rover Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners (“</span><b>Pet Owners</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”) and providers of pet-related services (“</span><b>Service Providers</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. The Rover Service includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers, and other services. We charge fees for some aspects of the Rover Service, as described below in Section 9.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.2 Rover does not provide Pet Care Services</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Rover is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners. Rover is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the Rover Service, does not provide pet care services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by Service Providers (“</span><b>Pet Care Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”), or about your interactions and dealings with users. Service Providers listed on Rover are not under the direction or control of Rover, and Service Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, Rover does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline. We conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles and we facilitate Background Checks or Identity Verifications (each as described in Section 10, below) on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the Rover Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not perform additional screening of Service Providers or Pet Owners. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the Rover Service. Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the Rover Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.3 Release</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span> <b>Subject to Section 16 below, Rover has no liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline. You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. (Any financial obligations Rover may have to its users in connection with user conduct are limited to the reimbursement obligations set forth in the </b><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/guarantee/"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Rover Guarantee</span></b></a><b>.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2.4 Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Rover Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the Rover Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for the limited refunds and “Reservation Protection” specified in Section 9.6 and the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/guarantee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover Guarantee</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, you agree that Rover has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the Rover Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.5 Bookings</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the Rover Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the Rover Service (a “<strong>Booking</strong>”). A Booking may be initiated by either a Service Provider or a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are a Pet Owner and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Request to book.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you are a Pet Owner and a Service Provider initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Pay Now.” All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide. Please visit the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/sso/zendesk/?return_to=https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Help Centre</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Service Providers. Though Rover performs a limited review of Service Provider profiles and facilitates Service Provider Background Checks or Identity Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and Rover does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date. Similarly, Rover does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the Rover Service, and Rover makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.7 Abandoned Pets; Re-homing</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking agree that Rover (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, transfer care to animal control or other law enforcement authorities, or find other alternate care. Pet Owner agrees to reimburse Rover and/or the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions. Further, Rover expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Service Provider’s care should Rover deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Service Provider, Rover will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care. Should Rover not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, Rover will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Rover in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Rover in connection with such transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.8 Emergencies</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, to contact Rover at the applicable telephone number or email address listed in the table at the end of these Terms. If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider and Rover to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Rover. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If your Service Provider reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you release the Service Provider and Rover for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care, including from reimbursement that may otherwise have been available under the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/guarantee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover Guarantee</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize Rover to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In certain circumstances, a Pet Owner may be eligible for reimbursement under the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/guarantee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover Guarantee</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Rover recommends that all users have adequate pet insurance to cover the costs of veterinary care.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.9 Consultation Services</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Rover may offer Pet Owners and Service Providers phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care. These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the Rover Service. If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care. You agree to resort solely to the applicable third party consultation service in the event of any claims arising from their services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.10 Google Maps</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Use of the Rover Service requires use of Google Maps features and content, which are subject to the current (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html</a></span> (including the Acceptable Use Policy at <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/</a></span>); and (2) Google Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</span></a> (collectively, the "<strong>Google Terms</strong>"). By using the Rover Service, you acknowledge and agree to the Google Terms as they apply to you (e.g., as an "<strong>End User</strong>"). Any unauthorized use of the Google Maps features and content may result in your suspension or termination from the Rover Service.</span></p>

Pet Owners may purchase Pet Care Services from a Service Provider by completing a Booking as described in Section 2.5. If you are a Pet Owner, you enter into a transaction with the Service Provider when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total amount indicated in the Booking, which includes service fees payable to Rover.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.3 Fees for Service Providers</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking as described in Section 2.5. If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction. Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking. The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider. Rover’s role is to facilitate the transaction. We will (either directly or indirectly through an authorized third party) collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold pursuant to Section 9.7) initiate payment to the Service Provider’s account 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking.

Except where otherwise specified via the Rover Service, they are calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay a Service Provider in a Booking and are collected from each Booking. Also, when you sign up to be a Service Provider, you may be charged a non-refundable profile review fee. For Service Providers outside of the United States who have provided a valid indirect tax identification number (e.g., VAT or GST number), amounts charged will be exclusive of applicable indirect taxes such as VAT or GST. Otherwise, amounts charged to Service Providers outside of the United States will be inclusive of applicable indirect taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.4 Service Fees</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We charge service fees for some aspects of the Rover Service.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.5 Late Fees and Additional Charges</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you are a Pet Owner, you acknowledge and agree that, if you fail to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking, you will be charged for additional service time (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">pro rata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> for each partial late day) at the daily rate established in the Booking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, you agree to indemnify Rover for, and agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for, any additional costs and expenses we or the Service Provider incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.</span></p>

The availability of the Reservation Protection depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Pet Care Services provided. Consult the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.rover.com/terms/reservation-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reservation Protection</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> page for details.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cancellations by Service Provider.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If a Service Provider cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period identified in the Booking, we will refund the fees paid by the Pet Owner for Pet Care Services not provided, as well as any service charge paid to Rover. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are a Service Provider, you can appoint a substitute Service Provider (as agreed by the Pet Owner and so long as the substitute has an active account on the Rover Service and has agreed in writing to accept a Booking) by contacting Rover to modify the Booking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If you do not find a substitute and repeatedly cancel accepted Bookings without justification, Rover may deactivate your account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cancellations by Pet Owner.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period specified in a Booking, we will refund fees in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Service Provider on the Rover Service. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All Service Providers are required to select a cancellation policy prior to completing a Booking so that Pet Owners are aware of the cancellation policy prior to Booking.

<li style="font-weight: 400"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">General Terms for Cancellations.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the Rover Service to do so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">For purposes of the policies and terms in this Section 9.6, the date of cancellation is the date that a user cancels through the Rover Service, regardless of any separate communications between users outside of the Rover Service.</span></li>

Further, Rover has no responsibility or liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the Rover Service.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Discretionary Refunds for Failure to Perform.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> In our reasonable discretion, if we determine that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services as agreed with the Pet Owner or is otherwise in breach of these Terms, then we may cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.7 Payment Holds</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are a Service Provider, Rover reserves the right to issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you pursuant to Section 9.3 if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reasons involving protection of Rover, the Rover community or third party rights. We may also recommend that third party payment service providers restrict your access to funds in your account under the foregoing circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.8 Authorization to Charge</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">When you pay for Pet Care Services or for other services on the Rover Service, you will be required to provide us with valid, up-to-date credit card or other payment information and to maintain that payment information (or an acceptable alternative payment method) on file with your account so long as you have any outstanding, confirmed Bookings. Rover’s role is to facilitate payments from Pet Owners to Service Providers as a limited payment agent for the Service Provider. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">You authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the Rover Service as they become due and payable, and to charge any alternative payment method Rover has on record for you in the event your primary payment method is expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge you for fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither Rover nor the Service Provider will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated with those fees. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the Rover Service are non-refundable once paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.9 Taxes</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Except for taxes on Rover’s income and gross receipts or where Rover is otherwise required to collect taxes, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible to pay any applicable taxes that arise as a result of your purchase, provision, or use of Pet Care Services via the Rover Service. This includes, without limitation, any form of sales tax, VAT, or income tax on fees paid or received by you through the Rover Service. In certain jurisdictions, Rover may be required by law to collect and/or report tax information about you. You agree to provide us with documentation that we determine to be necessary for us to fulfill those obligations and, if you fail to do so, that Rover may suspend or deactivate your account until such documentation is provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">9.10 Payment Processing</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Payment processing services may be provided by one or more third-party payment processors. Payment processing provided by Stripe is subject to the Stripe Services Agreement (available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://stripe.com/legal"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://stripe.com/legal</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">), and, if you are receiving payments via the Rover Service, the Stripe Connected Account Agreement (available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">) (collectively, the “<strong>Stripe Terms</strong>”). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to use the Rover Service to receive payment, you may be required to set up a Stripe account and accept the Stripe Terms</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. You authorize Rover to obtain all necessary access to, and perform all necessary activity on (including requesting refunds where appropriate), your Stripe Connected Account to facilitate payment related to Pet Care Services you purchase or provide. You further agree to provide accurate and complete information about you and your business, and authorize Rover to share it and transaction information with Stripe for the purposes of facilitating the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You understand and agree that Rover may review and rely on the information in the Background Check or Identity Verification in deciding whether to suspend or terminate or investigate a complaint about a Service Provider or Pet Owner, but also that we are not obligated to do so, and are not responsible or liable in any way in the event that any information in any Background Check or Identity Verification is not accurate, timely or complete. If you are the subject of a Background Check, you may contact the applicable third-party consumer reporting agency to dispute the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such information. You may contact Rover to dispute a decision to suspend or terminate your account that is based in whole or in part on the results of the Background Check. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">You agree that Rover’s rights and obligations under the Arbitration Agreement (set forth in Section 17, below) inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agency used for Background Checks or Identity Verification in respect of any claim that would be subject to the Arbitration Agreement if brought against us.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Rover reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Rover Service based on information in the Background Check or Identity Verification or for any other violation of these terms, as permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
<p><b>Be aware of the following limitations in Background Checks: Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms or through the Service, Rover may but is not obligated to re-run Background Checks on any Users.</b> <b>Background Checks may also vary by type, breadth and depth, and the results may exclude the following:</b></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.3 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><b>YOU AND ROVER AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED IN SECTION 17.11(d)-(e). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ROVER AGREE OTHERWISE, YOU AGREE THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</b> <b>ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR OR COURT MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER ROVER SERVICE USERS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement or the Rules (as defined in Section 17.5), disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this Section 17.3 may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (a) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (b) there is a final judicial determination that this Section 17.3 is unenforceable with respect to any claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then: (i) that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and stayed; (ii) this Section 17.3 shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all such remaining claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible; and (iii) the stayed claims and/or remedies may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction after all remaining claims are resolved by the arbitrator.</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.4 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Our preference will always be to resolve complaints amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration. Before you commence arbitration, you must first contact us in writing to explain your complaint through your local Rover office listed below and give us an opportunity to work with you to resolve it.  You or your legal representative, if you have one, may contact us by mail at A Place for Rover, Inc., Attn: Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501. Your written complaint must include your name, the email address associated with your account, a detailed description of the nature and basis of the dispute, and the specific relief sought. Your written complaint must be on an individual basis and personally signed by you. For any dispute that Rover initiates, a written complaint will be personally signed by a Rover representative and sent to the email address associated with your account. If the issue is not resolved within 30 days after receipt of the written complaint, either party may initiate arbitration as specified in Section 17.5 “Arbitration Procedures” or Section 17.11 “Bellwether Arbitrations,” as appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.5 Arbitration Procedures</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">As used in this Section 17, the applicable arbitration rules described below are referred to collectively as the “</span><b>Rules</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">US Disputes.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">  For disputes arising in the US, the arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (as modified by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards in cases of consumer arbitrations) (the “</span><b>JAMS Rules</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”) in effect at the time a claim is made, currently available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, respectively. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Non-US Disputes.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">  For non-US disputes, the arbitration will be conducted in English by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the applicable Rules of the International Center for Dispute Resolution in effect at the time a claim is made, currently available at  </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.icdr.org/icdrcanada"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.icdr.org/icdrcanada</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all cases, the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with law as specified in Section 18, below, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall dismiss an arbitration demand on the pleadings if it does not contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Any arbitration demand must be personally signed by you or by a Rover representative. The arbitration will be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, are incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the Rules or waive your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. If there is any inconsistency between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control, unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator also must follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 16. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, providing a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Decisions by the arbitrator are binding and enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Rover users, but will be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rover user to the extent required by applicable law. As limited by applicable law, these Terms and the applicable Rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Claim, including the determination of whether a Claim is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.6 Costs of Arbitration</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Payment of all filing, administration, case management, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "</span><b>Arbitration Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400">") will be governed by the applicable Rules.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  Each party will be solely responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs or any portion thereof to either party upon determining that the claim, cross-claim, or defense is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)) to the extent authorized by applicable law.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.7 Confidentiality</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all Parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.8 Severability</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If any term, clause or provision of this Section 17 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 17 will remain valid and enforceable,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">provided that </span><b>if the finding of partial invalidity or unenforceability results in a final determination that the class action waiver set forth in Section 17.3 fails with respect to all of the claims in arbitration, then </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Section 17 will be unenforceable in its entirety. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.9 Opt-Out Procedure</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">You can choose to reject your agreement to arbitration (Section 17.2) and your waiver of the right to bring or participate in class or representative actions (Section 17.3) by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("</span><b>Opt-Out Notice</b><span style="font-weight: 400">") in accordance with the terms of this Section 17.9.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to A Place for Rover, Inc., Attn: Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and the class action waiver and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to register for the Rover Service to which the opt-out applies.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> You must personally sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and class action waiver. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate and the waiver of the right to participate in class and representative actions, none of the arbitration provisions will apply to you and you will not waive your right to engage in class or representative actions, but the remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Arbitration Agreement and did not validly opt out of it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Claims (including Excluded Claims) in accordance with Section 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.10 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Rover prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Rover prior to the effective date of removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">17.11 Bellwether Arbitrations</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. For disputes arising in the United States, if, in close proximity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">one another, 20 or more arbitration demands of a similar nature are asserted against or on </span><span style="font-weight: 400">behalf of the same or related parties, the following procedures will apply:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha" type="a">
<li style="padding-left: 10px">The demands must be filed with JAMS on an individual basis and otherwise comply with all applicable filing requirements in this Arbitration Agreement, including the pre-dispute resolution and personal-signature requirements in Sections 17.4 and 17.5.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">Claimants will collectively select 5 demands and respondents will collectively select 5 demands, for a total of 10 demands, to be the “Bellwether Arbitrations.” These Bellwether Arbitrations will be individually arbitrated, as otherwise provided by this Arbitration Agreement. The parties will work in good faith with the arbitrators to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">The remaining demands not selected as Bellwether Arbitrations will not be arbitrated (or otherwise litigated in any venue) except as provided in Section 17.11(e). JAMS will immediately place any such matters on administrative suspension (or, alternatively, terminate the proceedings), and no party will be responsible for paying any filing or administrative fees in connection with the demand until the suspension is lifted or the demand is reinstated under Section 17.11(e). Any statutes of limitations applicable to a demand that is subject to this paragraph will be tolled as of the date the demand was filed.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">Within 60 days of the completion of the Bellwether Arbitrations (unless the parties agree to a lengthier period), all parties will engage in good faith in a non-binding global mediation of all remaining demands. Unless the parties agree on a mediator, the mediator will be appointed by JAMS and have experience in the underlying subject matter of the disputes. Rover will pay the mediator’s fee. Notwithstanding Section 17.7, the mediator may be provided the results of the Bellwether Arbitrations in order to facilitate a resolution of all or some of the remaining demands. Counsel for all parties must immediately present to their clients any final settlement offers emanating from the mediation.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">If the parties are unable to resolve all or some of the remaining demands within 90 days of the completion of the Bellwether Arbitrations (unless the parties agree to a lengthier period), JAMS will lift the administrative suspensions (or reinstate the terminated proceedings) for the unresolved demands only, and the unresolved demands will proceed in individual arbitration as otherwise provided by this Arbitration Agreement. However, any party to an unresolved demand may, upon reasonable notice to the opposing party, opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court on that unresolved demand. Any unresolved demands that proceed in court under this paragraph may do so in class or representative proceedings (subject to applicable law), notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this Arbitration Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the right to proceed in court under the preceding sentence applies only to the unresolved demands that were filed and subjected to the protocols set forth in this Section 17.11.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">The parties agree that the protocols set forth in this Section 17.11 are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving a large number of similar arbitration demands, including the demands of claimants who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 10px">The parties may seek relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this Section 17.11.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">18.1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">For users in the United States and Canada, these Terms, and any dispute between you and Rover, will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 17 (the Arbitration Agreement). Unless you and we agree otherwise, or except where prohibited by applicable law, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement does not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and Rover must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Washington, and you and Rover agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Seattle, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. </span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">18.2 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">For users in the EEA and the United Kingdom, the laws of England shall govern these terms, except that if you live in a country outside of England but within the EEA, certain mandatory applicable laws of your country will apply for your benefit and protection in addition to or instead of certain provisions of English law. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Any dispute that arises between you and Rover must be resolved by the English courts or the courts in your country if you live in the EEA outside of England.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">18.3 If you are a consumer in the European Economic Area, the European Online Dispute Resolution platform </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr"><span style="font-weight: 400">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> provides information about alternative dispute resolution, which you may use if there is a dispute that cannot be resolved between you and the relevant party.</span></p>
<p><b>19. Class Action Waiver</b>.</p>
<p><b>YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,  EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ROVER AGREE OTHERWISE, THE COURT MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE COURT MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER ROVER SERVICE USERS.</b></p>
<p><b>20. Force Majeure</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rover shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, fires, accidents, pandemics, disease, strikes, or other similar disasters.  Also, in such an event, the cancellation policies described in Section 9.6 may not apply and Rover may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Service Provider's selected cancellation policy.</span></p>
<p><b>21. Miscellaneous</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing in these Terms will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of the other. Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. These Terms are non-exclusive and do not prohibit Service Providers from offering pet care services via other means or third parties. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms will in no way affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified. To the maximum extent possible under applicable local law, this Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">These Terms will continue to apply even after your relationship with Rover ends.</span></p>
