<p>You represent and warrant that you own the User Content submitted, posted or distributed by you on or through the Services or Site or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this Terms of Use from any person identified in or implicated by your submission (including those shown in photographic content), and, in the case of minors, also from their parents or legal guardians, as appropriate, and that the submission, posting or distribution of your User Content on or through the Services or Site does not violate the rights of privacy, publicity, copyrights contract or any other legal rights of any person. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees and any other monies owing any person by reason of any User Content submitted, posted or distributed by you to or through the Services or the Site.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that those features and Services through which you can post or upload User Content (“Forums”) are public spaces and that your participation in such Forums creates no expectation of privacy.

IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OTHER USER CONTENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN A FORUM OR OTHERWISE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>The Services may have features that allow you to send or exchange messages with third parties. BREITBART makes no warranties, express or implied, takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content, materials, messages and the like that you or any other user sends, receives, distributes or posts through any email or instant message system.

If you are under the age of 18 but at least 13 years of age, you may submit User Content only with the permission of, and under the supervision of, a parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian agreeing to these rules for the benefit of an individual between the ages of 13 and 18, please be advised that you are fully responsible for his or her User Content and any legal liability that he or she may incur.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Some of the Services may be mobile or other applications that you can download to your phone, tablet, or other device (“<strong>Mobile App</strong>”) via a third-party service such as an application store. Your use of the third-party service may be subject to additional terms related to that service from the third-party service provider (“<strong>App Store Provider</strong>”). WE ARE NOT LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR, AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO, ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE OR ANY CLAIM OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Agreement and your use of the Mobile App is between you and us only, and not with any App Store Provider or its affiliates or subsidiaries. As between us and an App Store Provider, we are solely responsible for the Mobile App and its Content. If anything in this Agreement conflicts with any usage rules for the Mobile App from an App Store Provider, such terms from the App Store Provider control (only so far as those terms conflict with this Agreement, and then exclusively for your use of the Mobile App). All rights you have to use the Mobile App are for use only on appropriate products (which may require branding from the App Store Provider or other entities) and are non-transferable, except that the Mobile App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via features like Apple’s Family Sharing (or similar features from other App Store Providers) or volume purchasing. We are solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the Mobile App, as specified in this Agreement, or as required under applicable law. No App Store Provider has any obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services for the Mobile App, nor any warranties for the same.</p>

<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; DISPUTE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</strong> <strong>OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY</strong>.</p>
<p>ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF, HOWEVER, EITHER THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR COORDINATED CLAIMS PROVISION BELOW ARE FOUND INVALID, THEN THE SPECIFIC INVALID PROVISION WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND WILL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE.</p>
<h2><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></h2>
<p>You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy, including those known or unknown that may be later discovered, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, other agreements on the Services, or the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be either determined by binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California before one arbitrator or submitted to small claims court in Los Angeles, California. If the arbitrator finds this location to be unreasonably burdensome to you, a new location may be selected or arbitration may be conducted over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.</p>
<h2><strong>No Class Actions</strong></h2>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking Arbitration</strong></h2>
<p>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). The Notice to us must be addressed to: Breitbart News Network, c/o Webmaster, 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000 or the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p>
<h2><strong>Hearing</strong></h2>
<p>If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.</p>
<h2><strong>Award</strong></h2>
<p>In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least US $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer; we will pay your awarded damages or US $250, whichever is greater.</p>
<h2><strong>Injunctive Relief</strong></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p>You and we shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Proceedings</strong></p>
<p>If 25 or more individuals initiate Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are coordinated for these individuals (“<strong>Coordinated Claims</strong>”), the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for the individuals and our counsel for shall each select five cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (“<strong>Test Cases</strong>”). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against us. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to US $250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law and Rules</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. You and we acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
<h2><strong>Severance of Arbitration Agreement</strong></h2>
<p>If the clauses concerning and describing the procedures and obligations related to Coordinated Claims and Test Case procedures is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining entire arbitration agreement and any clauses concerning, relating to, specifying or otherwise describing the arbitration agreement shall be severed from this Agreement. However, any duty of confidentiality whether or not such duty is connected with arbitration shall survive such severance.</p>

<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users are entitled to the following consumer rights notice: California residents may reach the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at <a href="tel:1-916-445-1254">(916) 445-1254</a> or <a href="tel:1-800-952-5210">(800) 952-5210</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you agree to consciously waive all claims, both known and unknown that may be later discovered and expressly forgo and waive all protections as by California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” By using this Site, you agree that these California Civil Code Section 1542 protections no longer apply to you.</p>
<p><i>New Jersey</i></p>
<p>If you are a consumer residing in New Jersey, the following provisions of this Agreement do not apply to you (and do not limit any rights that you may have) to the extent that they are unenforceable under New Jersey law: (a) Disclaimer of Warranty; (b) Limitation of Liability; (c)Indemnity; and (d) under Disputes, the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver and the governing law provisions (solely to the extent that your rights as a consumer residing in New Jersey are required to be governed by New Jersey law). According to N.J.S.A. 56:12-16, you may have additional rights if you are a New Jersey resident and other provisions of this Agreement are found to violate an established legal right.</p>
