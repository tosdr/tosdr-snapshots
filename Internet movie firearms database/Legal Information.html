</p><p>17. General Information
Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements.

Resolution of Disputes. You agree that any controversy arising out of or in connection with our relationship, or a dispute with reference to these Terms, their validity or effect will be governed by the laws of the state of California without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any controversy arising out of or in connection with use of the Site or these Terms, their validity or effect, will be conclusively determined by arbitration in the City of Los Angeles in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that such arbitration will be held before a single arbitrator selected by the parties, which arbitrator must be well acquainted with the digital entertainment Internet industry. You agree that any proceeding that you may choose to bring against us will be initiated within six (6) months after the alleged date of the event bringing rise to such dispute. You waive any and all rights and benefits which you or we might otherwise have or be entitled to litigate any such dispute in court, because it is your intention to arbitrate all such disputes according to the provisions hereof. The arbitrator's decision will be controlled by these Terms. Any such decision and accompanying award will provide for each party, respectively, to bear its own costs of arbitration and attorneys' fees. The pendency of an arbitration, the proceedings, any evidence or other material, and any award shall be maintained and remain confidential, except that an award may be confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction if it has not been fully satisfied within 14 days of its issuance. Waiver and Severability of Terms. Our failure to exercise or enforce any rigt or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
