If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to bind that business or entity to these terms, and that business accepts these terms. By using any of the Services, you agree to these Terms and Conditions and any policies referenced within (“Policies”) these Terms and Conditions, including terms that limit our liability (see Section 18) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 21). You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us (collectively, the “Terms”). You should read all of our terms carefully.
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    1. Privacy
</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    You consent (Opt In) to LTW’s <a href="/privacy-notice"><strong>Privacy Notice</strong></a>, which explains how we collect, use and protect the personal information you provide to us.

During registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you are responsible to keep that information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your LTW Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to your LTW Account.

The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version.

</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to help secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures, use your personal information for improper purposes, or that the Services will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible mobile devices and computing device(s). You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or LTW Account or any other breach of security. Notwithstanding Sections 21 and 22 in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any LTW Account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >

    <p>THE USE OF “LTW” IN SECTIONS 18 AND 19 MEANS LTW, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND ITS LICENSORS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES).</p>
<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER IT IS EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LTW SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>LTW DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, WITHOUT DEFECT OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
<p>LTW does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party. </p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    19. Limitations of Liability and Damages
</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LTW BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICE. IN ALL CASES, LTW WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LTW BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR LTW ACCOUNT, OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.</p>
<p>THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF LTW HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    20. Third Party Items
</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>LTW MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY ITEMS, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    21. Disputes
</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and LTW, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to these Terms and Conditions or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    22. Binding Individual Arbitration

</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>You and LTW agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST LTW. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (<a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">https://www.adr.org</a>) according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms and Conditions and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a donor bringing a claim relating to a transaction intended for a personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur in Atlanta, Georgia, USA or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. LTW will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section for all claims totaling less than the equivalent currency to $10,000 (USD) unless the Arbitrator determines that your claims were frivolous. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and LTW also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of Atlanta, Georgia, or federal court for the State of Georgia.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    23. Governing Law

</p><div class="score-content-spot" >
    <p>These Terms and Conditions and any Dispute will be governed by Georgia law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act), without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.</p>
</div><p class="score-lead small" >
    24. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute

    <p>You may be offered ministry opportunities provided by third parties and not by LTW, including, but not limited to, third party developers who use LTW’s services (“Third Party Services”). If you decide to use Third Party Services, you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services and any applicable privacy policies of said Third Party Services. We are not responsible or liable for the performance of any Third Party Services. Further, you agree to resolve any disagreement between you and a third party regarding the terms and conditions of any Third Party Services with that third party directly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that relationship, and not LTW. The Services may contain links to third party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by LTW. Such third party websites are not governed by these Terms and Conditions. You access any such website at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Privacy Notice is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services, is subject to that website’s own terms, rules and policies.</p>

If any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These Terms and Conditions do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.
