<h3>4. License.</h3>
<p>(i) You acquire absolutely no rights or licenses in or to the Service and materials contained within the Service other than the limited right to utilize the Service in accordance with the TOS. Should you choose to download content from the Service, you must do so in accordance with the TOS. Such download is licensed to you by Bloomberg ONLY for your own personal, noncommercial use in accordance with the TOS and does not transfer any other rights to you.</p>
<p>(ii) Bloomberg’s long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested (see below). Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any original creative materials that you expect to be compensated for or that you would like to keep private. If you nevertheless choose to make any such submission, Bloomberg may freely use the submission, in whole or in part, for any purpose without any obligation to you.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you submit material (i.e., user-generated content, including, but not limited to: comments, text, video, audio, and photographs) to this site, any other site owned by BLP and its affiliates or to BLP or its representative, or if you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, or any other information (each, a “Submission” and collectively, the “Submissions”), despite our request that you not send us any unsolicited Submissions or other creative materials, the Submission will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Bloomberg, and Bloomberg shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Unless BLP indicates otherwise, you grant to Bloomberg a perpetual, nonexclusive, irrevocable, fully paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable (in whole or in part) worldwide right and license in any and all media, now known or later developed, to use, publish, reproduce, display, modify, transmit digitally, create derivative works based upon, distribute, copy, and otherwise exploit Submissions for any purpose whatsoever (including, without limitation, advertising, commercial, promotional and publicity purposes) in Bloomberg’s discretion without additional notice, attribution or consideration to you or to any other person or entity. You also permit any other user to access, store, or reproduce Submissions for that user’s personal use. You grant Bloomberg the right to use the name that you submit in connection with Submissions. You agree and understand that Bloomberg is not obligated to use any Submission you make to this site or Bloomberg and you have no right to compel such use. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Bloomberg is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that your decision to submit any material to Bloomberg does not place Bloomberg in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to your Submission. You represent and warrant that you are the original author or creator of the Submissions (except as expressly indicated otherwise), that neither the permission nor consent of any other person or entity is required to enable Bloomberg to legally use your Submission in accordance with this license and that Bloomberg’s use of your Submission in accordance with this license will not violate or infringe upon the rights of any person or entity, and that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the Submissions that you submit; that the Submissions you submit are truthful and accurate; that use of the Submissions you supply does not violate this TOS and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Bloomberg and its Suppliers, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, successors, and assigns for all claims resulting from Submissions you supply. Bloomberg and its Suppliers, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, successors, and assigns disclaim any responsibility and assume no liability for any Submissions submitted by you or any third party. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any claim that any use of such Submission violates any of your rights, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights, or right to credit for the material or ideas, and forever release and discharge Bloomberg and its licensees from any and all claims you may have in connection with Bloomberg’s use of your Submission in accordance with this license. Finally, you acknowledge that, with respect to any claim you may have relating to or arising out of Bloomberg’s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any material you submit to this site and/or Bloomberg, the damage, if any, thereby caused will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other equitable relief or to in any way enjoin the exploitation or other use of any Bloomberg product or service based on or allegedly based on the material, and your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law. You agree that this authorization contains the full and complete understanding between Bloomberg and you regarding Bloomberg’s use of your Submission and cannot be modified except by a document signed by Bloomberg and you.</p>
<h3>5. Fees and Payments.</h3>

<ul>
<li>All Sponsor Content, regardless of platform, will comply with Bloomberg’s guiding principles:</li>
<li>Transparency. All Sponsor Content and marketing messages will be clearly and distinctly differentiated from independent news content.</li>
<li>Independence. No Bloomberg journalist will participate in the production, editing or promotion of customized content or an advertorial. Sponsor agenda and/or concern will neither dictate nor delay editorial direction.</li>
<li>Editorial judgment. Bloomberg maintains the right to reject any program, advertiser or speaker whose presence would compromise the Bloomberg brand.</li>
<li>All Sponsor Content will be appropriately labeled and distinguished from Bloomberg editorial content in form, function and placement through the use of different type fonts, colors and graphics.</li>
<li>Paid programming, advertorials, and sponsored programs/segments will be clearly and prominently labelled as advertising. No Sponsored Content will imply endorsement of any product or service by Bloomberg, nor will it feature any recognizable Bloomberg names or logos.</li>
<li>Bloomberg may, in its sole discretion, allow the use of a Bloomberg Custom Content logo to be used in Sponsor Content. The design and placement of such logo will be at the discretion of Bloomberg, and any and all such uses shall be subject to Bloomberg’s prior written approval.</li>
<li>All Sponsor Content must be approved in advance and in writing by a Bloomberg Custom Content editor before it appears on any Bloomberg medium.</li>
<li>Sponsor Content is neither produced by nor contributed to by any editorial team member of any Bloomberg medium, nor does it necessarily reflect the views of the editors of any Bloomberg medium. A disclaimer similar to the following will be included with all Sponsor Content: “A sponsor paid for the creation and placement of the content on this page. No editorial member of any Bloomberg medium contributed to any part of its creation, and it does not necessarily reflect the editorial views of Bloomberg L.P. or any of its affiliated entities.”</li>
<li>Bloomberg may, in its sole discretion, include a more detailed disclaimer with certain Sponsor Content.</li>
<li>Bloomberg reserves the right to refuse or remove any program, advertiser or speaker that in any way: (i) disparages, defames or discredits Bloomberg or its products or services or otherwise compromises- in quality or presence- Bloomberg’s brand or (ii) is false, misleading, deceptive or illegal.</li>
<li>Where Sponsor Content allows user participation, the moderation and functionality of this element will be determined and implemented solely by Bloomberg and will be subject to the general Terms of Service for the applicable Bloomberg medium.</li>
<li>In the case of Sponsored events, sponsors will be clearly identified to all on-site participants and in marketing materials tied to the relevant conference or event in language that indicates their role as underwriters. Bloomberg does not guarantee speaking roles or other on-stage participation for paying sponsors and maintains editorial control and veto power.</li>
</ul>

<p>(i) Bloomberg operates this site in the United States. Bloomberg makes no representation that the Service, including merchandise offered for sale on this site and their copyrights, trademarks, patents, and licensing arrangements, are appropriate or available for use in locations other than the United States.

<h3>13. Governing Law.</h3>
<p>The TOS shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts-of-law principles thereof. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with the Service or from a dispute as to the interpretation or breach of the TOS.</p>
<h3>14. Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</h3>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
<p>(i) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Bloomberg, we are committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legalnotices@bloomberg.net. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Bloomberg. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Bloomberg agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below.</p>
<p>The aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>(ii) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided in herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legalnotices@bloomberg.net. If you are a Bloomberg registered user, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Bloomberg, must include the email address you used to register with Bloomberg.</p>
<p>You agree that by using this site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Bloomberg and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Bloomberg Entities”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with Bloomberg’s website or app or these TOS, including the determination of the scope, enforceability, or applicability of this Arbitration Agreement (as defined below), including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment) (“Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 14 (“Arbitration Agreement”). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein. This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the parties&#8217; decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (&#8220;intellectual property rights&#8221; in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party&#8217;s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party&#8217;s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.</p>
<p>(iii) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. YOU AND BLOOMBERG ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN SUBPART (VI) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, UNLESS BLOOMBERG PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.</p>
<p>With the exception of this subpart (iii) and subpart (vi) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this subpart (iii) or subpart (vi) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Bloomberg shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
<p>(iv) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com.</p>
<p>(v) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party&#8217;s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Bloomberg submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p>Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Bloomberg (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).</p>
<p>(vi) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Bloomberg (&#8220;Mass Filing&#8221;), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Bloomberg and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Bloomberg and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This &#8220;Batch Arbitration&#8221; provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Bloomberg otherwise consents in writing, Bloomberg does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this subpart (vi). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.</p>
<p>The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (vi) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Bloomberg shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.</p>
<p>(vii) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators, with Bloomberg and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Bloomberg, the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Bloomberg or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Bloomberg nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of Section 15 titled “Class Action Waiver” below. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.</p>
<p>(viii) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these TOS and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator&#8217;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum&#8217;s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of the &#8220;Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability&#8221; section of these TOS as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. Except for decisions in arbitrations that are joined together in a single batch, no individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys&#8217; fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.</p>
<p>(ix) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Bloomberg will pay any filing and hearing fees in in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys&#8217; fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in subpart (vi)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.</p>
<p>(x) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legalnotices@bloomberg.net with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) July 31, 2023; or (b) your first use of the Service, whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Bloomberg also will not be bound by it.</p>
<p>(xi) Changes. Bloomberg will provide thirty (30) days&#8217; notice of any material changes to this “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Bloomberg provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Bloomberg changes this “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Service 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.</p>
<h3>15. Class Action Waiver.</h3>
<p>You may only resolve Disputes with Bloomberg on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, consolidated or representative action. Except as described in Section 14(vi), class actions, class arbitrations, collective actions, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations aren&#8217;t allowed.</p>
