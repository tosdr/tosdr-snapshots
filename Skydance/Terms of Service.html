<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2>15.  Arbitration/Governing Law/Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except to the extent limited by applicable law:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding that body of law relating to conflict of laws. The parties agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach thereof, (collectively, “Dispute”) will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et seq., and the then-current rules and procedures of JAMS. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public. The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles County, California and be conducted in the English language. The decision rendered by the arbitrator will be binding upon the parties hereto, and any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of all federal and state courts in California. Venue will lie exclusively in Los Angeles County, California. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this paragraph shall affect Skydance’s ability to seek from a court injunctive or equitable relief at any time. These Terms of Use and any other Dispute brought by you against Skydance or by Skydance against you, or otherwise related to the Website, Skydance products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction, unless the applicable laws of your jurisdiction of residence require that the laws of such jurisdiction govern, in which case the laws of such jurisdiction are to govern.  This section shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and Skydance agree that we intend that this section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This section can only be amended by mutual agreement.  Either party may seek enforcement of this section in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If any arbitration or other proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret these Terms of Use or matters relating to it, the substantially prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator’s award, will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred in such arbitration or proceeding from the other party, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party is entitled; provided that in no event will the arbitrator have the authority to award punitive damages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Both you and Skydance waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this section is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.</strong></p>
