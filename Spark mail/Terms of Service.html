<h2 id="accountssync">Accounts and Sync</h2>
<p>To use the Spark email client, you have to register a personalized account ("<strong>Spark Account</strong>"), by providing your personal or business email address and passing the authorization procedure through your third-party email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon registration, you can add an unlimited number of your email accounts to Spark, including Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, Exchange, Outlook, Kerio Connect, and other IMAP email accounts. The accounts will not be added, if they are not supported by Spark.</p>
<p>To log in to your Spark Account on other devices you need to use the same email address you used to register the Spark Account unless you change the email used to create the Spark Account in the Preferences of the App. If you change the Spark Account, your personal settings, added accounts, and all emails will be synced automatically across all devices on which you are logged in.</p>
<p>You do not have to use a password to log in to Spark, however, you can enable a passkey lock or Face ID in your mobile App. All the passwords to your email accounts are created through third-party providers. Upon changing the password, you need to log in to your email account again using the updated credentials.</p>
<p>You are the one solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the login credentials you use for login with your email accounts, and for all activities that occur under those credentials. You are solely responsible for any liability or damages resulting from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>
<p>To log out and delete your email account from Spark, please use the Spark Account’s settings in the App. When you delete the email address that you used for registration in Spark and for sync, you will also be logged out from the other email accounts you added to Spark. Your personal data will be deleted in accordance with the retention periods specified in our <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app" target="_blank">Privacy Policy for the App</a>. Please note, that Spark reserves the right to suspend and/or delete your Spark account in case of your violation of these Terms.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="datastorage">Data Storage</h2>
<p>We process and store your personal data based solely on the legal grounds directly prescribed by the GDPR, namely:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>your consent; </li>
	<li>when processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us;</li>
	<li>our legitimate interest; and </li>
	<li>legal obligation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You may find all the information about our purposes for data processing, the exact categories of data collected, and your rights as a data subject under the GDPR in our Privacy Policy for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app" target="_blank">App</a> and for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-web" target="_blank">Website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The content of the emails you send and receive is stored on the server of your third-party email account provider, save for the cases described below. Spark allows you to connect to your email accounts by accessing the IMAP and EWS servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spark does not back up emails, therefore they cannot be stored locally on your device. Spark caches emails and attachments over the past month when connected to Wi-Fi so that you can later look through your inbox even offline. All connections to the servers we use are protected with TLS network communication security protocol.</p>
<p>At the same time, such unique features as Teams (shared emails and comments, shared drafts, shared links, delegation), Shared Inboxes, Snoozed emails, Templates and Send Later, as well as push notifications require the support of the servers we use and your emails corresponding to these features are safely stored there in an encrypted form.</p>
<p>To provide you with the sync option, we also encrypt the information about your accounts and preferences, including login credentials, and store it on our secure servers. The encryption key is saved locally on your device, so only you have access to it.</p>
<p>To make everything as safe as possible, we do not use our own servers. Instead, we rely on Google Cloud service, which is fully <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/soc-2" target="_blank">SOC-2</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27001" target="_blank">ISO 27001 certified</a>. Moreover, we use HTTPS, alarm systems, VPN, and written internal policies regarding the protection of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we conclude a DPA with you, we use the Standard Contractual Clauses based on legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage which takes place in third countries under the GDPR, such as the USA and Ukraine.</p>
<p>If you want to exercise your right to erasure under GDPR and you want all the data about your accounts and preferences from Spark to be deleted, please use the "General" section in the Preferences of your App. Scroll to the bottom and click "Remove My Data From Spark." All your data will be irreversibly deleted from the servers we use immediately. Please learn more about your data in our Privacy Policy for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app" target="_blank">App</a> and for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-web" target="_blank">Website</a> or contact our DPO at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Spark is available for free download and use in desktop or mobile versions compatible with macOS, iOS, Android, Huawei, and Windows through <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1176895641" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-email-by-readdle/id997102246" target="_blank">App Store</a>, <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFCS9QJBKTHVZ" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readdle.spark&amp;hl=uk&amp;gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103789413" target="_blank">Huawei AppGallery</a>&nbsp;respectively.</p>
<p>Certain functionalities of Spark require payment before you can use them ("<strong>Subscriptions</strong>"). For example, you may need to subscribe to use certain team functionality or extra premium functionalities. Subscriptions can be purchased by paying an annual or monthly subscription fee. Subscription fees are charged at the beginning of the subscription and, because such subscription renews automatically for an additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel it (for example, for the next month in the monthly subscription), at the time of each renewal until you cancel or exhaust the funds available on the card used for the purchase of the Subscription.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the pricing structure for our Subscriptions. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing subscribers from those changes. If we need to change the prices for existing subscribers, we will give at least 30 days' notice and will notify you via the email address used to create your Spark Account or by posting a notice about changes on our App and Website themselves. Your continued use of the App after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spark offers two types of Premium subscriptions: Premium plan for Teams and Premium plan for Individuals. If you need advice regarding the subscription plans and plans that we offer to large customers, please contact our sales specialist at <a href="mailto:support@sparkmailapp.com">support@sparkmailapp.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Payment Arrangements&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Spark provides you with a few options to pay for the subscription, such as Stripe and in-app payments at App Store and Google Play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you decide to pay for the subscription via the Website or Microsoft Store, the payments are facilitated by a third-party provider, namely Stripe, in accordance with the latter’s <a href="https://stripe.com/en-ie/checkout/legal" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. In no case shall Spark be responsible for any personal data processed by Stripe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Spark downloaded from the app market (such as App Store for iOS, Mac App Store for Mac or Google Play for Android devices, excluding Microsoft Store), Spark may include in-app purchases that allow you to buy subscriptions. Payments may be processed through the Google Play or App Store from which you originally downloaded the application. If you purchase the subscription through the in-app purchase, then the app market’s in-app purchase rules and policies will also apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscription bought is shared across your own apps and services that you use to access your Spark Account. We reserve the right to revise the subscription fees at any time, subject to providing users with adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective. The revised fees will not apply to your current subscription period; however, your continued use of the Premium plan after the effective date of such change will constitute your agreement to pay the updated fees.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>, if your local currency is different from the currency in which the prices are quoted, your bank will apply the exchange rate applicable per the date of purchase, which is beyond our control. Also, your bank may apply an exchange commission or fee.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE ALSO NOTE </strong>that the subscription fee (both for Individuals and Teams) is inclusive of applicable value added tax ("VAT") and/or other taxes which are imposed under the relevant tax laws. The VAT and/or other tax charge will depend on your location. When you get to the final stage of the checkout, we will show the tax component of the subscription fee for your information.</p>
<h3>Trial periods and Discounts</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period without payment (a "<strong>Trial</strong>") or at a reduced rate (a "<strong>Discount</strong>"). Please review the App pricing page to learn about the duration of the trial period, the terms of participation and the amount of the discount available. Discounts may change over time, as well as conditions of Discounts, and we may decide to cease providing Discounts or introduce and offer you any other benefits.</p>
<p>Once the Trial period or the last month covered by the Premium Subscription expires, the features, which are available as a part of the Premium Plan, may become unavailable in full or in part.</p>
<h3>Subscription for Spark Teams: Free and Premium Plan</h3>
<p>Spark offers two plans for Teams: Free and Premium. With the Premium plan, you can invite an unlimited number of team members to draft an email in real-time, create an unlimited number of email templates and use the advanced sharing settings. Read more about the team features and pricing <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/pricing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>To use more advanced Spark features for Teams, you will need to purchase a monthly or annual Premium subscription plan by upgrading Free Plan through the App Settings on any of your devices and submitting your billing details. The upgraded subscription plan will automatically sync across all devices you are logged in.</p>
<p>The subscription fee is calculated on a monthly basis per the number of active users invited to your Team in accordance with the rates specified on the checkout screen. An active team member is a person who has joined your team via invitation or automatically (based on email domain name). In the case of a number of active users changes during the subscription period, the applicable fee will be calculated separately at the end of each calendar month to adjust outstanding payment debts (if any) in accordance with <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/prorations" target="_blank">Stripe’s prorations rules</a>. The payment for the number of active users that has exceeded the original Subscription Plan will be charged once per month. If you have any questions regarding prorations, please contact our support at: <a href="mailto:support@sparkmailapp.com">support@sparkmailapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>After you finish managing your team members, please choose a monthly or yearly billing frequency. Your first Premium subscription will be charged upon upgrade, and you will be provided with the invoice.</p>
<h3>Subscription for Spark Users: Free and Premium Plans</h3>
<p>Spark offers two plans for Individual usage: Free and Premium. You may get access to the full functionality of Spark by purchasing the Premium Plan. With the Premium Plan, you will be able to pre-screen who can email you, prioritize senders and threads, send large email attachments by uploading them to the Spark Cloud and use other premium features.

<h3>Spark +AI Add-On Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Spark +AI is a Premium feature designed to facilitate email creation and editing using machine learning algorithms. Please refer to the 'AI Features' section below to learn more about it.</p>
<p>Spark +AI feature is available exclusively to our Premium Users of Spark 3 and is also accessible during the Trial period.</p>
<p>Premium Users of Spark 3 and Users during the Trial period are provided with a monthly spending limit for the Spark +AI feature ("<strong>Monthly +AI Quota</strong>"). At the beginning of each billing month (which commences depending on when you became a Premium Users of Spark 3), the Monthly +AI Quota is full and equals 100%. Every use of the Spark +AI feature, such as generating text, replying, rephrasing or proofreading, consumes a certain percentage of the Monthly +AI Quota depending on various factors, including the number of characters and the language of the text.</p>
<p>The Monthly +AI Quota automatically refills to 100% at the beginning of each of your billing months. An unused percentage of the Monthly +AI Quota cannot be carried forward to the next month.</p>
<p>If you have depleted the Monthly +AI Quota, you have two options: either wait for the next monthly automatic refill, or purchase an add-on ("<strong>Powerbank</strong>") if you wish to continue using the Spark +AI feature during the current month. Each Powerbank add-on is a one-time, non-renewable, and non-refundable purchase. You can make unlimited Powerbank purchases each month.</p>
<p>The Spark +AI feature will first take up your Monthly +AI Quota; once it is depleted, it will start consuming your current Powerbank percentage, provided you purchased one.</p>
<p>If you have not depleted your purchased Powerbank(s) during your billing month, the Powerbank(s) will be automatically carried forward to the next month. Please note, if your Premium subscription has expired, you will still be able to use the Spark +AI feature until you have depleted your Powerbank entirely.</p>
<h3>Loyalty Package</h3>
<p>After the release of a new major update, some features that were earlier presented in the Free subscription may become part of the Premium subscription plan; the Users who started using Spark before the change will retain their access to such Premium features free of charge until they delete their Spark Account and can use the discount on the Premium subscription.</p>
<h3 id="subscriptionrenewalcancellation">Subscription Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
<p>The subscription will automatically renew for a subsequent term unless you cancel it in the App preferences or by notifying Spark Mail at <u>billing@sparkmailapp.com</u> of non-renewal at least five business days prior to the subscription expiration date.</p>
<p>If you bought the subscription through the third-party app market, more information about how you may be able to manage in-app purchases (or switch off the subscription) using your device may be set out in the app market's terms and conditions or end user license agreement (EULA):&nbsp;</p>
