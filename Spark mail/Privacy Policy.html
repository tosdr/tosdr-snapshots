<p>You own and control the personal data we collect about you. You can choose not to provide certain information or disable and prevent us from collecting, storing, and processing it by changing your account’s settings (e.g., by revoking consent or opt-out checkboxes), via our email address <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a> or by any means of communication available for you. Please be aware that you may not be able to enjoy some of Spark’s features in such a case.</p>

<h2 id="controllerdetails">Controller Details</h2>

<p>Any organization that collects and processes data can play different roles depending on particular data processing operation. For example, Spark plays different roles depending on the feature you use. In this Section, we explain how Spark meets the role requirements.</p>

<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>

<p>We are the Controller of the personal data for the Users (Free), Users (Premium), Teams, Organizations, and Enterprises (representatives of Organizations or Enterprises) from the moment of the User’s consent to the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>This means we determine the amount, purpose, and means of personal data processing when you use the App.</p>

<h3 id="processor">Processor</h3>

<p>Under the applicable privacy protection rules, we can also act as the data processor depending on the particular data protection operation. This is the case where Spark provides a self-help tool, product, or feature and does not use personal data without the user’s instruction. For example, Spark does not use the email addresses of the email senders for Spark’s marketing activities, but only to enable the User to receive and send emails via Spark Service.</p>

<p>We are processing data on behalf of Organizations or Enterprises (based on the agreed instructions provided in the Data Processing Agreement; you may request a copy of our Data Processing Agreement at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>).</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid #222; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 32px;">
	<strong>Example</strong>: Company A purchased 15 licenses for employees. The Сontroller of the employees’ data is Company A, while we are the processor concerning this processing activity (namely, where we provide them with Spark services at the expense of Company A). As a data processor, Spark does not use such data (e.g., email addresses of third parties) for our own purposes, for example, for cold calls marketing.
	<br><br>
	As a result, we are processors for all personal data of Users, employees, or contractors of the three categories: the Organization, the Enterprise, and the User (Free or Premium).
</p>

<p>For more details about our role as a Controller and a personal data Processor, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>. Alternatively, you can also send us a letter.</p>

<h2 id="legalgrounds">Legal Grounds of Processing</h2>

<p>We can process personal data based on the following legal bases:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>performance of the contract</strong> for processing that is strictly necessary for service provision as written in Terms of Service, such as technical and customer support;</li>
	<li><strong>legitimate interest</strong> for processing that is reasonable for the User and required for the development of the service;</li>

	<p><strong>Example of legitimate interest:</strong></p>
	<p>We collect the history of your requests made on the App in order to customize services we propose to you. Sometimes, we will write emails to our registered Users to inform them of our new features and products.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="personaldata">Personal Data in Spark: What We Collect</h2>

<p>This section explains our approach and practices for processing personal data at different features in the App.</p>

<h3 id="beforestart">Before we start</h3>

<p>We process two categories of data: technical and personal data you provide to us. Some of it can be seen on the client-side (interface), and some are processed on the backend.</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid #222; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Client-Side</strong> is the part of the App displayed or takes place on the users’ devices.</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid #222; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Backend</strong> is an invisible crucial part of the App where algorithms operate on the variables and data points. In the majority of cases, it is crucial to process such data in order to provide our services to you. For example, we keep backend data taking into account organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of your data.</p>

<p>As defined, you may belong to one of the categories of Users:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Free User (Free)</li>
	<li>Paying User (Premium)</li>
	<li>Team</li>
	<li>Organization</li>
	<li>Enterprise</li>
</ol>

<p>We collect your personal data according to this Privacy Policy when you use the App. When you use our Website, your personal data is processed in accordance with the Website’s <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-web" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. Some of the data the App collects automatically, such as the country the App is used in: we get this data based on the IP address or from the App Store (we receive this information in a generalized form). Generally, all the data provided to us can either be linked to you or not (i.e., anonymized data).</p>

<p>We either create new personal data items or receive them from you. For example,</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>data we create and assign</strong> will include userID, subscription expiration date, appToken, and</li>
	<li><strong>data we collect from you or the third parties on your behalf</strong> would include payment history, requests, app usage data, account data, technical data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dataprocessed">Data Processed</h3>

<p>We process some personal data for purely business purposes: to enable you to use our services, to notify you of our new products and features, to invite you to participate in our special programs and offers, and to use parts of your data (usually pseudonymized) to monitor the trends and develop our product and business. We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service. We only collect the information necessary to provide you with our services.</p>

<p>Unless we specify a particular legal basis, we process your personal data based on the contract (our <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>) (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: performance of contract).</p>

<p><strong>Email address</strong>: As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email. For this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App. Your email address is a unique identifier of you as a User within our system and allows us to secure your data. Your email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service, such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or core functionality of our App or Service. We may also use your email to sync your data with your third-party accounts (if you request us to do so in the App), or occasionally contact you for marketing purposes (it will be in our legitimate interests to do so). You will always have a chance to opt-out of such sync or any marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime. Please note that your email is safe with us, and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.</p>

<p><strong>OAuth login or mail server credentials</strong>: Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication. Without such access, our Product will not be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience. In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as “send later”, “sync between devices” and where allowed by Apple – “push notifications” we use Spark Services. Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.</p>

<p><strong>Billing data</strong>. We may need to process your personal data to ensure the smooth operation of your subscription plan and comply with the applicable laws. We do not have access to your sensitive payment data (as the payment processor will only collect your personal data to process the payment), but we may store your payment processor id, payment status, and information about your subscription terms (such as type and duration).</p>

<p><strong>Identity of a team you join</strong>: In order to make team collaboration within Spark possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message. Team identity is necessary to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team. Our system creates a record about the team only when you create one.</p>

<p><strong>Email content while using Spark Services</strong>: We allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service. It allows you to have a secure space to share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, have private discussions, or create links to specific emails. We may retain your email for some time (at your request) when you use the “Send later” feature. This information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you, so you can collaborate with your teammates via email.</p>
<p><strong>Input and output:</strong> When using Spark +AI, you can provide input (email text and prompt) for processing and receive generated output. We do not retain the content of your emails or prompts but only transmit them to the AI provider for processing. They do not use your data for model training and keep it no longer than 30 days. Read more about Spark +AI and its data processing practices in the ‘<a href="#azureopenaidata" class="scroll-to" rel="nofollow">AI Providers Data</a>’ section.</p>
<p><strong>Email samples and writing style description:</strong> When you activate ‘My Writing Style’, we process your recently sent emails to analyze their length and other criteria and select appropriate samples (‘samples’). Further, we pass the selected samples to the AI provider for analyzing your writing style and getting the textual description of it. Your emails are analysed for the samples and writing style description only once unless you use the ‘Rescan email samples’ option in the ‘Settings’, change the samples manually, or delete them and reactivate the feature.</p>
<p>The samples are stored in your account as settings of the feature. You can review the samples in the ‘Settings’ and manually replace them with other examples if you wish. We also store the samples and your writing style description in our backend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you generate email with Spark +AI further, we will pass only your writing style description along with each request to the AI provider.</p>
<p>Spark will store the samples and your writing style description until you delete your account or until you delete all samples manually. Please note that when you delete all samples we automatically delete the writing style description.</p>
<p>Read more about ‘My writing style’ in the ‘<a href="#azureopenaidata" class="scroll-to" rel="nofollow">AI Providers Data</a>’ section.</p>

<p><strong>IP address and settings</strong>: The core functionality of our Product is based on an Internet connection, that is why our App and Service will not properly function without it. Your IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet, and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes. We also retain information about your settings so you may ensure the synchronization of your choices and experience between your devices.</p>

<p><strong>APNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service)</strong>: Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox. You’re free to enable or disable them during the initial App setup or later using your device’s system preferences.</p>

<p><strong>App token assigned by us</strong>: This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.</p>

<p><strong>Device, App version, iOS version information</strong>: We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical information with regards to App usage</strong>: In order to better understand general app usage patterns and improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product. Collecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates, and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts. You may read Amplitude’s <a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> to learn more about their processing of personal data.</p>

<p><strong>Recently accessed email messages, collaboration threads, and shared inboxes</strong>: We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates, such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations, and shared inboxes. By collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark App and provide a better communication experience with your team.</p>

<p><strong>Some of your email contacts</strong>: Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people. To block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the “whitelist” of senders for push notifications. We’ll sync this “whitelist” of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications. If you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Pixel data and link clicks information</strong>. We may use email and other marketing software to collect metrics on our marketing campaigns. Usually, pixels help their providers to collect technical data, such as the time when the image was loaded and the IP address, etc. For example, we may use the Braze service to see email opening rate, and then use this opening rate to enhance our emails and send our users a more helpful material or relevant offer in the future. Braze can also register that the link in the email was clicked on. You may disable pixels in your email service provider’s settings and avoid opening links, if you don’t want to participate in the collection of this statistics. In Spark, you should go to the “General” section of Settings page to disable loading the pixels.</p>

<p><strong>Logs</strong>: Some information about your use of the Spark Mail services can be stored either by us or by your device. When we collect this information on our servers, we do so to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App. The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on the device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information. This data is used only for technical purposes – that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App,to investigate possible security incidents, and to troubleshoot bugs and problems with the App reported by you. If you report an issue that prevents you from enjoying Spark, we may need the log data that is contained on your device to investigate the issue and troubleshoot. As we cannot obtain those logs without you sending them to us, we will rely on your consent.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Support communication</strong>: Regarding the email: we save a record of communication, including attachments and information you voluntarily decide to share with us for troubleshooting purposes whenever you communicate with our support team.</p><p>To enhance your experience, we collect analytics on customer support requests to understand the most frequent inquiries and identify areas for improvement within the App. This analysis is conducted internally within Spark using secure, in-house technologies, including pre-trained machine learning models. Rest assured, we do not use your personal data to test or train these models.</p>
<p><strong>Request a feature</strong>: When you contact us via the “Request a feature” form with your proposal for our product enhancement, we process your email address, type of device, your name (if you’re willing to share it), and any other additional information you may provide in the form. We process this data based on your consent. We automatically collect some technical information (platform, app version, date of installation, Spark ID and Braze ID) for a detailed analysis of your proposal. It is in our legitimate interest to do so. Also, we assign a unique identifier (token) for each form submission and collect the date and time of the submission.</p>
<p>We use Typeform to collect your request and Google Sheets to process it further. To know more of how your personal data is processed, you may read <a href="https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt/?typeform-source=www.typeform.com&amp;tid=6e1275f0-d924-4083-bc77-b88eb10f8195" target="_blank">Typeform’s Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We will use your data to prepare a proposal for our product development team and your email and name to contact you for more details (if needed) and notify you of the implemented features resulting from your request. We may keep and process this data for a few years but no longer than 6 years (as provided by the general statute of limitations in Ireland) and do not use your data for any other purposes except those mentioned in this section.</p>
<p>The “Request a feature” form is available in all Spark app versions except Spark Classic (Spark 2 on Mac).</p>
<p><strong>Data from Microsoft Corporation</strong>: When you download and use Spark Mail from the Microsoft Store, we may occasionally receive data, including telemetry or crash data, from Microsoft Corporation. This data is used only to improve the App and to test or troubleshoot quality issues, such as bugs, in accordance with the Microsoft Store App Developer Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Your Feedback</strong>. We may publish your feedback, reviews and comments about your experience with our App ("<strong>Feedback</strong>") on our website, in the App or otherwise. This includes the Feedback you provide to us directly or via any platform, including but not limited to online distribution platforms, marketplaces, and social media. We process personal data in your Feedback, which may include your first and last name, username, the text of the Feedback and/or any other information contained in or related to the Feedback. We do not process personal data of children under the age of 16 and/or sensitive types of data in the Feedback. Under the GDPR, we rely on our legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing personal data in the Feedback if your Feedback was collected from the third-party platform (such as online distribution platforms, marketplaces, and social media), and we will ask for your consent to publish the Feedback that you provided to us directly. We use your Feedback to demonstrate the capabilities and features of the App, to share real user experiences with the App and to attract potential customers. For more information about your Feedback, please refer to the "Your Feedback" section of our <a href="/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other information you decide to provide us with</strong>: Based on your decision and consent, we may also process any other personal data provided by you (for example, the information in your email signature or the first couple of lines from the email to show you the push notification) to make your experience of using some of our features more pleasant and tailored to your purposes and needs.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: some data (such as company data) can be treated as non-personal data when processed in the absence of context. However, if such data is collected and processed alongside other data points or data items (such as name, telephone number, email, etc.), it can identify a particular person and therefore constitutes personal data. You may check the official position of the EU by reading:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Recital 26 of the GDPR,</li>
	<li>Article 4 of the GDPR,</li>
	<li>Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data issued by the Working Party 29 (predecessor of the EDPB), and</li>
	<li>Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users issued by the EDPB.</li>
</ul>

<p style="border: 1px solid #222; padding: 10px;">Please note that we do not store all the data we receive from you. Mainly, the data is stored locally on your device. This means we see pseudonymized or even anonymized data. For more information on retention periods of your personal data please see “<a href="#termofstorage" class="scroll-to" rel="nofollow">Term of storage and retention periods</a>" section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="googleuserdata">Google User Data</h3>

<p>Spark's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. This section may be helpful for you if you use Spark in conjunction with your Gmail account.</p>

<p><strong>Permissions</strong>. When seeking access to your Google user data, all permission requests are being sent by Spark Mail App. Your authorized client credentials to access your Gmail account provided to us will be kept confidential. We request access only to the information we need; we will prompt you to refresh the access permissions if we implement new features. Where possible, we will use incremental auth.</p>

<p><strong>Revoking access to Google User Data</strong>. You may revoke Spark’s access to your Gmail account by using Gmail settings: My Account -&gt; Security tab -&gt; Third-party apps with account access -&gt; Manage third-party access -&gt; Spark -&gt; Remove access.</p>

<p>If you decide to do so, we will lose access to your Gmail account in Spark, and we will no longer be able to show you emails from it, and show and sync your Google Calendar. Upon your request (and when you delete your Spark account), we will delete all data collected from your Gmail account; however, in such a case, we may not be able to provide you with the ability to use Spark Mail features to work with your Gmail emails.</p>

<p><strong>Types of data requested</strong>. We will list the types of data requested on the permission request webpage. If we need more (or less) permissions to run our Service, we will prompt a new permission request for you to review and consent (or reject). Not all Google User Data may contain personal data. Some statistical data will be anonymized.</p>

<p><strong>Request purpose</strong>. The purpose for which the App requests your user data is to enable you to use Spark Mail features when working with your Gmail account emails. Without access to the emails, we cannot provide you with the features that include assessing, using, writing, changing, deleting, storing, sharing, filtering, whitelisting, and other manipulations with the emails as described in this Data Processed (by feature) section that are performed on your behalf (in other words, pursuant to your instructions issued by manipulating the Spark’s interface). We do not use your Google User Data for any other purposes but to provide you with access and the ability to use the Spark Mail Service.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>. We do not use Google User Data to display, sell, or distribute this data to any third party conducting surveillance. Spark Mail has no hidden features, services, or actions that are not mentioned in this Privacy Policy or the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.

<ul>
	<li>use access only to read, write, modify, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client that allows Users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets;</li>
	<li>not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements, including retargeting, personalized, or interest-based advertising;</li>
	<li>not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement (consent) to view specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating a bug or abuse, complying with applicable law, investigating an issue, and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized;</li>
	<li>ensure that your employees, agents, contractors, and successors comply with this Google API Services: User Data Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="azureopenaidata">AI Providers Data</h3>
<p>We use different AI Providers (Azure OpenAI Service by Microsoft Corporation, Open AI by Open AI LLC, Vertex AI by Google) to offer the Spark +AI feature, which is designed to help you create and edit emails with the help of machine learning algorithms. We may switch between the AI providers to provide a more secure and faster service, to run new versions of models, or for other commercially justifiable reasons. The switch between AI providers is manual, and we retain full control over it.</p><p>Please note that, in the event of a switch between AI Providers, the data processing rules and interaction protocols will remain the same as described below. We will not provide notification about such switches.</p>
<p><strong>Applicability</strong>. This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to our Premium Users of Spark 3 who use the Spark +AI feature or Users who get access to it during the Trial period. By default, Spark +AI is switched off: you must opt in to enable the Spark +AI feature.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong>. We use the AI Providers' services and Spark +AI based on your consent. By using Spark +AI, you consent to the processing of your personal data by us as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of the AI Providers' services, you should not switch on the Spark +AI feature that incorporates it. If you decide to withdraw your consent, you must switch off the Spark +AI feature.</p>
<p><strong>Generation of Spark +AI data</strong>. Spark +AI helps you generate and edit email drafts. Spark +AI does not send emails on your behalf. You have full control over the generated content at all times, and you can review and edit it any time before sending.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use of Spark +AI data</strong>. Spark +AI is designed to protect your private data we obtain from you or about you. We do not store the contents of your emails and your requests for the Spark +AI feature. If you choose to use the Spark +AI feature, we will only transfer the textual context of your email to Microsoft to process your request and generate or edit email text based on that and additional context.</p>
<p><strong>Model training</strong>. We do not use your private data to train Microsoft, OpenAI or any other machine learning model when you use the Spark +AI feature. Any information, including personal data, that you furnish while using the Spark +AI feature will be shared with the AI Providers solely for the purpose of functioning of the Spark +AI feature. We do not permit the AI Providers to use your personal data for any other purpose except for debugging in the event of a failure and to monitor the potential misuse or abuse of their services. According to the AI Providers' documentation, they do not use customer data to train, retrain, or improve the base models.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Spark +AI data</strong>. Your email content and requests you make to Spark +AI are private and encrypted in accordance with our standard privacy and information security practices. We implement the latest commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect your personal data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in Spark, or third party services.</p>
<p><strong>Input and Output</strong>. You may provide input (prompt) to be processed by Spark +AI (“<strong>Input</strong>”), and receive output generated and returned by Spark +AI based on the Input (“<strong>Output</strong>”). When you use Spark +AI, Input and Output are your customer data (“<strong>Customer Data</strong>”). You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Customer Data.</p>
<p><strong>‘My Writing Style’ feature</strong>. This is an AI-powered feature based on profiling. Profiling refers to the automated processing of personal data to assess specific aspects of a person. In this case, profiling does not result in any legal implications for you, nor does it significantly impact you in a similar manner. It analyzes a selection of your recently sent emails (referred to as ‘samples’) to learn and mimic your writing style. Subsequently, it applies your writing style and tone of voice to all new Spark +AI-generated email drafts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the feature is turned off. You can activate or deactivate it within the ‘Writing Assistant’ of the ‘Spark+ AI’ section in your account settings.</p>
<p>When you turn on the feature, we automatically select samples that meet the length and other criteria from your recently sent emails and pass such samples to the AI provider to get the description of your writing style. The AI Provider will not have access to your other emails. Further, the description of your style will be sent to the AI provider along with each request when you draft new emails with Spark +AI.</p>
<p>Read more about samples, their review, and deletion in the ‘Email samples’ subsection of ‘<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/privacy-app#dataprocessed">Data Processed</a>.’</p>

<h2 id="agelimitation">Age Limitation</h2>

<p><strong>Please pay attention</strong>. We <strong>do not knowingly process</strong> the data from Users under the age of 16 without a legal representative’s consent. If you are such a User or the user’s legal representative, please inform us by email at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="termofstorage">Term of Storage and Retention Periods</h2>

<p>The retention periods mentioned in this section have been calculated by taking into account the data minimization principle enshrined in the GDPR and applicable laws that affect the processing of personal data. We analyzed the processing of data on every step of data processing and calculated the shortest periods necessary to meet the purposes of data processing.</p>

<p>Please read this section together with the retention periods provided in the descriptions of the features.</p>

<p>In general, we store personal data for the following periods of time:</p>

<div class="table-block">
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th>User (Free)</th>
				<th>User (Premium) and representatives of Organizations and Enterprises</th>
				<th>Teams<br>(Free and Premium)</th>

				<td class="td-align-top"><strong>Processing and retention</strong>: duration of the contract (<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>). If the User is inactive for 36 months, Spark will send two reminder emails notifying that the Account will be suspended (and personal data deleted) unless the User logs in.<br>The User will then have some time (“renewal period”) to log in to the Account and renew their Free Subscription. Otherwise, the Account will be deleted upon the expiry of the renewal period.<br><br><strong>At the User’s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion</strong> but not later than after 12 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.</td>

Intra-Team communications that contain personal data will be retained as long as the Team owner remains an active Premium User.<br><br>
					<strong>At the User’s request, their Account can be retrieved after the deletion</strong> but not later than after 36 months after the User refused to activate the Account or ignored the reminder emails.

</div>


<p><strong>Consent</strong>. We process the data based on your consent during the general term unless you withdraw it. After you withdraw your consent, it will take us up to 30 calendar days to erase your data.</p>

<p><strong>Updates and marketing emails</strong>. We may send you emails describing our new updates, features, discounts or opportunities. Given that the major updates are rare and Spark works closely with the users’ requests for new features, we may keep your data for up to a few years (but no longer than 6 years after the User account is deemed abandoned) to keep you informed of new opportunities Spark offers. You will always have the option to unsubscribe using the link at the end of the email or contact us via email at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a> to opt out from receiving such emails.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Support communication</strong>. We may retain the history of communication (including the contents of the communication, attached files, etc) between you and our Customer Support team for a few years but no longer than 6 years (as provided by the general statute of limitations in Ireland) to be able to respond to all your further questions and requests or inquiries of the entities that you authorize to act on your behalf, including those of legal nature. We apply necessary security measures to ensure that the communications and attachments are archived with access to them restricted.</p>
<p><strong>Your Feedback</strong>. We will retain the Feedback which you provided to us directly for 5 years and the one which was collected from the third-party platform for 2 years, unless the law compels us to store it for longer in case of any procedures or actions. However, we reserve the right to delete your Feedback at any time at our sole discretion. You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sparkmailapp.com" target="_blank">support@sparkmailapp.com</a> to request that we refrain from or cease using your Feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deletion</strong>. We will delete the data we process as a Controller under GDPR within one (1) month following the request. In case the request is complex or we have received a number of requests from the same individual, we may extend the time to respond to it by a further 2 months. We will inform you of any such prolongation within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay in response.</p>

<p>We store your personal data either until you delete the Account or after a certain period depending on the data type. When a retention period expires, we either delete your personal data or anonymize it so that it cannot be restored.</p>

<p>After the above respective periods expire, we delete your personal data. It may be stored for statistical and analytical purposes in anonymized form.</p>

<p>We process your personal data based on your consent during the provision of services, during the term of storage (as defined above), or until you withdraw your consent, depending on the Feature.</p>

<h2 id="backupstorage">Backup Storage</h2>

<p>We store your data in the backups of databases. We regularly back up our databases: at least once a day and usually store them for one (1) week.</p>

<p>We use Google Cloud SQL service for the backup purposes. You can learn more about the procedure in their guide <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backups" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="datasharingtp">Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>

<p>We use your personal data based on the performance of the contract to provide services and communicate with the Users.</p>

<p>We may share personal data with our affiliates to the extent necessary to develop and/or support Spark. We share your personal data with our contractors to the extent necessary to provide services, technical and customer support. In addition, we can share your data on the following grounds: consent, compliance with the law (or legal obligation), and legitimate interest. Also, we have implemented organizational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data during data transfer to third-party.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consent</strong>. We share your personal data based on your explicit consent.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance with the law</strong>. We will disclose your personal data to third parties to the extent that it is necessary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to comply with a government request, court order, or applicable law;</li>
	<li>to prevent unlawful use of our App or violation of the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/legal/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and our policies;</li>
	<li>to protect against claims of third parties;</li>
	<li>to help prevent or investigate fraud.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Legitimate interest or performance of the contract</strong>.

We may transfer your personal data to certain companies, consultants, and contractors hired to provide certain services on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Independent data controllers</strong>. We may sometimes receive your personal data from other, independent data controllers. We usually do so in one of two cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the third-party data controller shares your personal data with us in response to your request (for example, when you sync Spark Mail with your account in another app); and/or</li>
	<li>an app store shares some data about on-market or in-app purchases, crash events, failed attempts to download or launch the app, or any other information that may affect your ability to buy, download, and use Spark Mail and its features on your device. For example, such independent data controllers can be Mac App Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Huawei AppGallery depending on your choice and device.</li>
</ul>
<p>We process these personal data only to enable you to use Spark Mail or its particular features (for example, to fix the bugs that do not allow your device to launch the app). We will not use your data received from these independent controllers to build any profile about you, or use it for any marketing or advertising purposes. We anonymize or aggregate these data where possible (such as where there is no request from you to our tech support to help fix the bug) before processing.</p>

<p>We may share your personal data with other Subcontractors, such as auditors, lawyers, accountants, software engineers, and other specialists and experts that we may engage on a contractual basis.</p>

<h2 id="datasharingoutsideeea">Data Transfer Outside the European Economic Area</h2>

<p>The personal data we collect is stored on servers in the USA. The data is stored in the USA by default, but we may need to process your personal data in another country. We also share some data with our service providers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The European Commission has recognised the United States (commercial organisations participating in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework) as providing adequate protection. In particular, Google LLC and its wholly-owned US subsidiaries (unless explicitly excluded), have certified that they adhere to the DPF Principles.</p>

<p>There is no adequate decision by the European Commission regarding Ukraine. Therefore, we have prepared a data processing agreement based on the standards of the Standard Contractual Clauses and carried out the legislation assessments for data protection during transfer and storage in third countries under the GDPR, such as Ukraine.</p>

<p>You can read detailed information on measures we take to protect your personal data <a href="#" class="scroll-to" rel="nofollow">here</a> and, if signed, in our Data Processing Agreement with you. If you upload, send or create personal data of your clients or other data subjects via one of our Services, you may ask for a signed Data Processing Agreement by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="securitymeasures">Security Measures</h2>

<p>We regularly perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to ensure that we use an appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. We follow ISO 27001 Standard to put all security controls in place as a basis.</p>

<p>To be more specific, to protect your personal data, we use HTTPS and encryption, divided group and individual access (where appropriate), alarm systems, corporate VPN, written approved internal policies (like password policy and physical access policy).</p>

<p>Moreover, we systematically monitor our technologies’ state of the art and never forget about the backups. All our contractors are under contractual obligations which are compliant with the GDPR requirements.</p>

<p>Here you can find information about the steps we mentioned above:</p>

<h3 id="trainedteam">Trained team</h3>

<p>Our team is competent in the matter of your personal data protection. Company regularly performs training in order to ensure that every team member has enough knowledge to keep your data safe and protect it in accordance with the best practices prescribed by European and U.S. laws on data protection.</p>

<h3 id="httpsencryption">HTTPS and encryption</h3>

<p>We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. Your email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric and asymmetric encryption: private and public keys.</p>

<p>We currently use Google ("<strong>Hosting providers</strong>"). These Hosting providers have various international security certificates that ensure your data safety.</p>

<ul>
	<li>App Center. You can read more on the security measures via <a href="https://appcenter.ms/" target="_blank">the link</a>.</li>
	<li>Google. You can read more on the security measures via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security" target="_blank">the link</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="securitymeasuresdetailed">Security measures (detailed explanation):</h3>

<p><strong>1. Physical access control: group access and alarm system</strong></p>

<p>We secure access to the premises via ID readers, so only authorized persons have access to them. The ID cards can be blocked individually; access is also logged.</p>

<p>An alarm system is installed on the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorized persons. The alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.</p>

<p><strong>2. System access control: individual access and password policy</strong></p>

<p>Each employee has access to the systems/services only via their employee access. The access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.</p>

<p><strong>Password policy</strong>. We regulate access to our systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length. The SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.</p>

<p>We have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords. This guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.</p>

<p>Passwords must meet specific requirements. It must be at least:</p>

<ul>
	<li>12 characters long</li>
	<li>1 letter in upper-case</li>
	<li>1 letter in lower-case</li>
	<li>1 number</li>
	<li>1 special symbol</li>
</ul>

<p>Our systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default. Only connection types defined by exception are accepted.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data access control: monitoring and physical access policy.</strong></p>

<p>All servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring. This includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.</p>

<p>Due to the proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.</p>

<p>Locking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and practiced.</p>

<p><strong>4. Transfer control: contractual obligations and corporate VPN</strong></p>

<p>Before transferring any data, we specify organizational and security requirements in Data Processing and Data Transfer Agreements (if applicable). These agreements are obligatory for every Enterprise and us as the Controller.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the handling of local data storage devices, e.g., USB sticks, is regulated via agreements.</p>

<p>Access to the systems outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.</p>

<p><strong>5. Input control: general restriction</strong></p>

<p>Our employees do not work directly at the database level but instead, use applications to access the data.</p>

<p>IT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.</p>

<p><strong>6. Availability control: backups and division</strong></p>

<p>We ensure the availability of data in several ways. For example, there is a regular backup of the entire system. This can be used if the other availability measures fail.</p>

<p>Critical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centers and controlled by a high-availability system.</p>

<p>Our workstations are also protected with the usual measures. For example, virus scanners are installed, and laptops are encrypted.</p>

<p>We would like to specify that we use MDM-solution to protect employee devices with security settings.</p>

<p><strong>7. Separation control: limited access.</strong></p>

<p>We use logically separate databases to prevent unauthorized persons from accidentally reading data with limited access.</p>

<p>Access to the data is also restricted because employees use services (applications) that control access.</p>

<p><strong>Opt out of disclosure for direct marketing purposes</strong>. California law allows residents to learn the identities of entities that received their personal data for marketing purposes and the categories of information disclosed. You may request such information by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:dpo@sparkmailapp.com">dpo@sparkmailapp.com</a>.</p>

The method used needs to consider how customers normally interact with the Controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the Controller to authenticate the requests.</p>

<p>Controllers are prohibited from requiring a customer to create a new account to exercise their customer rights but may require a customer to use an existing account.</p>

<p><strong>Right to Opt-Out</strong>. Virginia residents visiting our websites may request to opt out of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, or profiling. Virginia laws allow its residents to learn the identities of entities that received their personal data for marketing purposes and the categories of information disclosed.

<h3 id="regionspecific-delaware">Delaware legislation</h3>

<p>For residents of Delaware, we provide more information about the relevant legislation and your privacy rights granted by the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising to children</strong>. DOPPA regulates operators only as far as they provide services or platforms that are 'targeted or intended to reach an audience composed predominantly of children'. However, this does not include services or platforms that merely refer or link to another service or platform directed at children.</p>

<p>Operators can also be liable under DOPPA if, despite not directing their services or platforms to children, they have actual knowledge that children are accessing the services or platforms. In such an event, an operator cannot knowingly use, disclose, or compile that child’s personal information, nor can an operator allow another to do the same. An operator that provides a covered service or platform cannot advertise or market content inappropriate for children. In this regard, DOPPA provides an enumerated list of prohibited content, including alcohol, tobacco, firearms, fireworks, tanning equipment and facilities, lotteries and gambling, tattoos, drug paraphernalia, and pornography. You should note that an operator need not monitor the preceding if it uses an advertising service and ensures that it complies with DOPPA.</p>

<p><strong>Do-not-track requests</strong>. Delaware residents visiting our websites may request that we do not automatically gather and track information about their online browsing movements across the Internet. Such requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms that provide customers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal data about an individual customer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We currently cannot honor these requests. We may modify this Policy as our abilities change.</p>

<h3 id="regionspecific-nevada">Nevada Legislation</h3>

</ul>

<p><strong>Do-not-sell request</strong>. Nevada does not require entities to include a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" button or link on their websites. Instead, it mandates that entities provide consumers with an email address, a toll-free telephone number, or an Internet website to submit verified Opt-Out requests.</p>

<p><strong>Response time</strong>. Upon receiving a "verified consumer request," a business has 45 days, with a possible 90-day extension when "reasonably necessary" and by providing notice to the consumer, for a total of 135 days.</p>
