</p>
<h4>SMS, MMS AND OTHER TEXT MESSAGING</h4>
<p>
    As part of some of our Services, you may receive SMS, MMS or other text message notifications and communications from us and our business partners (each, a “Text Message”) as well as other
    messages that Cirkul and our business partners send you (for example, via email). When signing up for the Services, you will receive a welcome message and instructions on how to stop receiving
    messages. The frequency of Text Messages Cirkul and our providers may send varies and these Text Messages may include, without limitation, messages about your Cirkul orders, card reminders and
    other messages about products and services that Cirkul thinks may be of interest to you by or on behalf of Cirkul. You hereby acknowledge that consent to receive Text Messages is not a condition
    of purchase of Cirkul products and services.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your mobile provider’s standard message and data rates may apply to our confirmation Text Message and all subsequent Text Message correspondence
    according to your individual rate plan provided by your wireless carrier. Please consult your mobile service carrier’s pricing plan to determine the charges for browsing data and sending and
    receiving Text Messages. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any text messaging or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device or
    telephone number. If your carrier does not permit text alerts, you may not receive the Text Messages from us. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered text messages. You can opt out of
    receiving any further Text Messages from us by replying “STOP,” “QUIT,” “END,” “REVOKE,” “CANCEL,” “OPT OUT,” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to any Text Message you receive from us. You understand and agree
    that use of different words, spellings or additional words or phrases as part of the command are not an effective means of opting out of receipt of further Text Messages and that Cirkul and our
    business partners will have no liability for failure to honor such requests. If you submit a valid opt out, you may receive an additional Text Message confirming your decision to opt out.
</p>
<p>
    We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any Text Messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. Text Message services are provided on an “AS
    IS” basis and may not be available in all areas at all times and may not continue to work in the event of product, software, coverage or other changes made by your wireless carrier. Data obtained
    from you in connection with any text message services may include your cell phone number, your provider’s name and the date, time and content of your messages, and such other information as
    described further in our Privacy Policy. You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that you will not provide, upload, transmit or send any content or data that is contains, reflects, embodies or
    references any personal health information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
    Health Act (“HITECH Act”), or any other content that you do not have full right and legal authority to provide, upload, transmit or send to Cirkul.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>By signing up for the Services or otherwise joining our mailing list at checkout and providing us with your wireless phone number, you confirm that you want us to send you information that we
        think may be of interest to you to such phone number, which may include using automated dialing technology to send you Text Messages at the wireless number you provided, and </strong><strong>you agree to receive communications from Cirkul. You represent and warrant that each person you register for the Services or for whom you provide a wireless phone number has consented to

    or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.

    Certain of our Services, including the purchase of any products or Auto-Ship items (such as plans) offered by us, may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”),
    which in certain cases may include recurring, automatically renewing payment obligations (as further described in the “AUTO-RENEWALS AND RECURRING BILLING FOR  PLANS AND OTHER AUTO-SHIP
    SERVICES” section below). Please see our Help / FAQ for a description of the current Paid Services, our shipping terms, and cancellation and refund policies. Please note that any payment terms
    presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
    You may place an order for Paid Services at any time (subject to any planned or unplanned downtime). You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit
    your order to us by clicking the “Submit Purchase” button on the checkout page. An order submitted by you constitutes a legally binding offer given by you to us to purchase the Paid Services
    specified in that order, subject to these Terms of Service, at the price and on the terms stated when you sign up or place your order. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. Your order will
    not be considered accepted until we have received payment of the purchase price of your order. We may send an acknowledgment of our receipt of your order to the email address you provide, after
    your payment for the order has been processed, so that you may print the information for your records. Unless otherwise stated at the time you place your order, title and risk of loss pass to
    you at the point you receive a shipping confirmation number to the email address you specified when you placed the order, provided full payment of all sums due in respect of the product(s),
    including any delivery charges, has been received.
</p>
<p>
    Delivery of orders is confirmed via shipping carrier and you are notified by email from Cirkul when delivery is confirmed. If you claim non-delivery you must contact Cirkul by email at
    <a href="mailto:help@drinkcirkul.com">help@drinkcirkul.com</a> within 5 days from the delivery date as noted by the carrier. You are entitled to one reshipment of one order if you notify Cirkul
    within the 5 day window. Any notification after 5 days will not be honored and neither a replacement nor a refund will be provided.
</p>
<p>
    Our products and services, including, without limitation, our Paid Services, are for your personal, non-commercial use, and once delivered to you may not be resold, redistributed, exported or used
    for any other commercial purpose. The rights you have under these Terms of Service are personal to you and are non-transferable.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, we don't accept returns of product or do exchanges of product. If your order was damaged in-transit, or if you've received the wrong Cirkul order, please reach out to our customer
    service team immediately on our help page or by emailing <a href="mailto:help@drinkcirkul.com">help@drinkcirkul.com</a> - and we will do our best to make sure that your issue is
    resolved. If you believe there is a quality issue with your order, please take note of the code and the "best by" date printed on the packaging of the Sip, so that we can trace the specific batch
    of product you have received. These inquiries will be handled on a case by case basis.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we cannot offer refunds, exchanges or customer service for products that have been acquired from an unauthorized reseller, including, but not limited to, any seller on Amazon,
    eBay or similar online marketplaces.
</p>
<p>
    We hope you're satisfied with your purchase but due to the nature of our consumable products we are unable to accept returns or provide refunds. If your order arrived damaged you have 45 days from
    the date the order processed to notify us via our help desk at <a href="mailto:help@drinkcirkul.com">help@drinkcirkul.com</a>. Our Customer Experience Team will respond to your inquiry at
    their earliest convenience. After examining the issue associated with your product, they may determine they are able to provide a replacement product. We reserve the right to offer only one
    replacement per account customer. We do not provide replacements on damaged Cirkul products purchased from any unauthorized reseller, including but not limited to any seller on Amazon, eBay, or
    any other reseller or group that trades or sells Cirkul products.
</p>
<h4>BILLING</h4>
<p>
    We use third-party payment processors, Shopify, Recharge and Braintree, (the “Payment Processors”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing
    Account”) for the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processors in addition to these Terms of Service. More
    information is available in our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processors. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processors,
    all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processors, to charge your
    chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payments using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processors
    make even if they have already requested or received payment.
</p>
<h4>PAYMENT METHOD</h4>
<p>
    The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen
    Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processors, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
</p>
<h4>IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS:</h4>
<h4>AUTO-RENEWALS AND RECURRING BILLING FOR PLANS AND OTHER AUTO-SHIP SERVICES</h4>
<p>
    Some of the Paid Services, such as the purchase of auto-replacing cartridges or other products in a plan, may consist of an initial period for which there is a one-time charge or a Trial Offer (as
    defined below), followed by recurring periodic charges as agreed to by you when you sign up for such auto-replacing products (“Auto-Ship Services”). The Auto-Ship Services give you the
    ability to specify the quantity you would like to order any auto-replacing products. Unless you opt out of a Auto-Ship Service, which can be done via the methods described below,
    the Auto-Ship Services that you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the auto-ship term you originally selected,
    at the then-current non-promotional rate. More information on Auto-Ship Services can be found at our Help / FAQ page. By choosing a Auto-Ship Service, you acknowledge that
    such Auto-Ship Service has an initial and recurring payment feature, and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to the effective date of cancellation of such Auto-Ship
    Service. All recurring payments relating to Auto-Ship Services are fully earned upon payment.
</p>
<p>
    To cancel your Auto-Ship Services at any time, log in to your profile page and click "your details" and then select "cancel plan" in red. On the next page select the option that best applies
    as to why you are cancelling. Read over the tip and then a cancel button will appear at the bottom of the page. Close the dialogue box and then the "Cancel Plan" button.
</p>
<p>WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR AUTO-SHIP AGREEMENT BY ACCESSING YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT AND SELECTING THAT OPTION.</p>
<h4>CURRENT INFORMATION REQUIRED</h4>
<p>
    You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account. You must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as
    a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our Payment Processors if your Payment Method is canceled (e.g., for loss or
    theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made on your Account.
    IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID
    SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
</p>
<h4>CHANGE IN AMOUNT AUTHORIZED</h4>
<p>
    If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to
    receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. If, on receipt of such notice, you do not wish to
    continue with the purchase, you may cancel at any time before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.
    You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
</p>
<h4>REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORIZATION</h4>
<p>
    Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service (including, without limitation, Auto-Ship Services) reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid
    Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in
    advance, in arrears, per usage or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.
</p>
<h4>FREE TRIALS AND OTHER PROMOTIONS</h4>
<p>
    Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service (a “Trial Offer”) must be used within the specified time of the Trial Offer. You will be required to have a valid Payment
    Method on file in order to initiate a Trial Offer. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the Trial Offer period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel
    prior to the end of the Trial Offer period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@drinkcirkul.com">help@drinkcirkul.com</a>. Trial Offers are
    one-time only for new customers and are limited to one per household. Additional terms and limitations may apply and will be more fully explained at the time you sign up for the Trial Offer. Any
    such additional terms and limitations are deemed part of these Terms of Service.
</p>
<h4>INNER CIRKUL REWARDS PROGRAM</h4>

The Inner Cirkul Terms and Conditions are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. Cirkul reserves the right to modify or terminate the Inner Cirkul Terms and Conditions at
    any time at Cirkul’s discretion for any reason or for no reason whatsoever. If Cirkul determines that you are attempting to obtain unfair advantage or otherwise violate the Inner Cirkul Terms and
    Conditions or spirit of the Inner Cirkul rewards program, Cirkul reserves the right to revoke any rewards or incentives issued.
</p>
<h4>TERMINATION</h4>
<p>
    We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and
    destruction of all information associated with your Account. If you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Site or through the Services. Any fees paid
    hereunder are non-refundable. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
    provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity provisions and limitations of liability.
</p>
<h3><strong>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND RELEASE</strong></h3>
<p>
    We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you. You acknowledge that we have no duty to take any action regarding which users gain access to the Services, or how you may interpret
    or use the Content. You release us and our officers, directors and employees from all liability arising out of or relating to your having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We
    make no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance or legality of
    material or Content contained in or accessed through the Services.
</p>
<p>
    You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
    creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
</p>
<p>
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE
    EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (I) THE SERVICES WILL BE
    SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; (II) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (III) ANY CONTENT OR SOFTWARE AVAILABLE AT OR THROUGH THE SERVICES IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER
    HARMFUL COMPONENTS; OR (IV) THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS LIMIT OR DO NOT ALLOW THE
    DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED OR OTHER WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</p>
<h4>INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
<p>
    You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless us and our employees, contractors, directors, officers, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including reasonable
    attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services or Content in violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement by you, or any third party using
    your Account or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
    otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.
</p>
<h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
<p>
    Our liability to you is limited, as stated in our Terms and Conditions and other policies. Nothing in our policies limits liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or our liability to you in the
    event of death or personal injury resulting from our negligence.
</p>
<p>
    We are not liable or responsible in any way for any user-generated content. We provide strict guidelines on the use and reproduction of trademarks, logos and other user-generated content but we do
    not control and are not responsible for what users submit on or through our websites. We also are not responsible for offensive, obscene, unlawful or objectionable user-generated content, or any
    content that infringes on others' rights that may be found when using our websites.
</p>
<p>
    Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or certain types of limitations or exclusions of liability, the limitations and exclusions set out in our policies or
    Terms and Conditions may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
    TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR EXECUTIVES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT,
    STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE, DATA LOSS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF OR
    DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, COMPENSATORY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
    WHATSOEVER (HOWEVER ARISING AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION) OR
    (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS (IN THE AGGREGATE) OF THE GREATER OF (A) FEES PAID TO US FOR THE PARTICULAR SERVICES DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PREVIOUS THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD OR (B) $100.00.
    THESE LIMITATIONS WILL ONLY APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND DO NOT APPLY TO DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM OUR ACTS OR OMISSIONS OR TO LIABILITY RESULTING FROM OUR GROSS
    NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOU IMPLEMENT PROPER PROCEDURES FOR DATA BACKUP AND VIRUS CHECKING.
</p>
<h4>DISPUTES</h4>
<h4>ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
<p>
    ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE
    INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY
    AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE JAMS, INC. (“JAMS”) RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL
    BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WE OR YOU MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO GRANT IT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED
    INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD
    HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Small Claims Court; Class Action Waiver.</u> As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if such
    claim is within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will
    participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS
    CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in
    a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Procedures.</u> These dispute resolution provisions will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event that JAMS is unwilling or
    unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration
    Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not
    have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
    out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.
</p>
<p>
    <u>30-Day Opt-Out Period.</u> If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this Disputes section, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30)
    days of the date that you first accept these Terms of Service (unless a longer period is required by applicable law), and then you must litigate any disputes against us in accordance with the
    “Governing Law and Jurisdiction” section below. Your written notification must be mailed to us at the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. If you do not notify us in accordance
    with this paragraph, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and further including such
    provisions in any revisions we make to these Terms of Service after the date of your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email address and mailing address;
    and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your ability to participate in a class action. If we make any changes to this Disputes section
    (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices or rejections of future changes to this Disputes section), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, within
    thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if you had
    properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted the provisions in this Disputes section. If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, you
    are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent pursuant to
    this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; if you previously entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future,
    your notification that you are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes section shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Severability.</u> If any of the prohibitions against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the
    preceding language in this Disputes section will be null and void. This Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement and class action waivers contained herein, will
    survive the termination of your relationship with us.
</p>
<h4>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h4>
<p>
    Subject to the Disputes section above, these Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, including its conflicts of law rules, and the
    laws of the United States of America. Subject to the Disputes section above, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed
    by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of Middle District of Florida.
</p>
<h4>MODIFICATION</h4>
<p>
    We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Service, or change, suspend or discontinue the Services, in whole or in part, (including, without
    limitation, the availability of any feature, database or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate
    means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Subject to the Disputes section,
    your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.

    or blocking access to the design-saving or other features of our site to any user who uses our site in violation of any such law, and/or terminating in appropriate circumstances the account (if
    any) of any user who uses our site in violation of any such law. Pursuant to Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512, we have implemented procedures for receiving written notification of
    claimed copyright infringement and for processing such claims in accordance with such law. If you believe your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right is being infringed by a
    user of DrinkCirkul.com, please provide written notice to the following agent for notice of claims of infringement:

<h4>UPLOADING ARTWORK</h4>
<p>Our online order form allows you to upload your own logo/text. Please read the instructions located on the order form carefully to ensure a successful upload of your logo.</p>
<p>
    The design studio is helpful in providing you with a very general image of your custom bottle; however it is not accurate in logo placement, as each item has a 'specific' imprint area. Our artists
    will therefore have to resize the entire imprint you submit in order to "fit" it into the actual imprint area.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, unless you "save" your design on the design studio, the design will not be saved and we will not receive it. Therefore do ensure that you have carefully followed all the directions so
    that we will receive your artwork/logo in its entirety.
</p>
<p>
    Customers will assume complete responsibility to obtain permission for reproduction of logos, patents, trademarks and copyrights. By agreeing to print any submitted artwork, Cirkul will not be
    held liable under any circumstances.
</p>
<h3><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></h3>
<h4>ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND SEVERABILITY</h4>
<p>
    These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site and the Application, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
    communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or
    invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of
    either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
</p>
<h4>FORCE MAJEURE</h4>
<p>
    We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical,
    electronic or communications failure or degradation.
</p>
<h4>ASSIGNMENT</h4>
<p>
    These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our
    rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
</p>
<h4>COUPON CODES</h4>
<p>
    Coupon codes have no cash value and cannot be redeemable for cash, and cannot be combined with any other offers. Limit one coupon code per order. Coupon codes generally expire and are no longer
    valid for redemption 30 days after their date of generation, but certain coupon codes may have their own redemption period as specified in connection with the coupon code itself. The unauthorized
    reproduction, resale, modification or trade of coupon codes is prohibited. Coupon codes are void where prohibited, taxed or restricted. Cirkul reserves the right to change or limit coupon codes in
    its sole discretion.
</p>
<h4>AGENCY</h4>
<p>
    No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither you nor Cirkul has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any
    respect.
</p>
<h4>NOTICES</h4>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all notices under these Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given: (i) when received, if personally
    delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; (ii) when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or (iii) the day after it is
    sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Electronic notices should be sent to <a href="mailto:help@drinkcirkul.com">help@drinkcirkul.com</a>.
</p>
<h4>NO WAIVER</h4>
<p>
    Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any
    particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written
    notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.
</p>
<h4>HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION</h4>
<p>
    The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of the words “including”, “for example” or “such as” in
    these Terms of Service shall be read as being followed by “without limitation” where appropriate.
