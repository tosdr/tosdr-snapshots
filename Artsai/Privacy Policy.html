		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__blue-span">Cookies</span><br />
		We or third-party advertising services providers selected by our customers may employ advertising pixels (clear gifs) on websites and advertisements that interact with some of our services. Pixels help to manage advertising content on websites.<br />
		Pixels work with cookie strings to record the interactions of users with websites and advertisements.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__blue-span">Mobile Advertising Identifiers</span><br />
		In mobile apps, there are no cookies. Instead, mobile device’s operating system provides user-resettable identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID, and any other unique identifier that may be assigned to the mobile device).<br />
		We collect Mobile Advertising Identifiers to enhance ad serving and targeting capabilities.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__blue-span">IP Address</span><br />

		This is data that we lawfully receive from other digital advertising companies that we work with ("Advertising Partners") to help us deliver ads to you and recognize you across browsers and devices. This may include pseudonymous advertiser identifiers - hashed (not readable) advertiser identifiers that do not directly identify you, your device, or your demographic data such as age range. We may work with our Advertisers and Advertising Partners to synchronize their pseudonymous identifiers to our own to enable us to more accurately recognize a particular browser or device and the advertising interests associated with it.</li>

		<p class="privacy__text">Cookies are small text files stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize web browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.</p>
		<p class="privacy__text">Pixels and tagging scripts are elements allowing communication between a web browser and a server. Pixel is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tagging script is a small piece of website code that is run by the web browser.</p>

			<h2 class="title__h2">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
        </div>
		<p class="privacy__text">We use this information to serve ads to you that are more relevant to you and, in turn, improve performance of an Advertiser’s ad campaigns.</p>
		<p class="privacy__text">Specifically, we use this data for:</p>
		<ul class="stress">
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Targeting</span><br />
		Selecting ads that are more likely to be relevant to you based on the interests previously associated with your device and the time of day you may be most interested in viewing these specific ads.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Frequency capping</span><br />
		Making sure you don't see the same ad too many times.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Sequencing</span><br />
		If you are being served a sequence of ads, making sure we show you the right ad next in the sequence.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Cross-device matching</span><br />
		Identifying different devices that are likely to be associated with you so that ads can be targeted, capped and sequenced across those devices, and so that campaign effectiveness can be measured and analyzed.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Attribution</span><br />
		Monitoring when, where, and at what price we served certain ads on behalf of an Advertiser so that we can measure our influence on the marketing results of the Advertiser’s campaigns and overall marketing strategy.</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Reporting</span><br />
		Providing Advertisers insights into how their ads are performing and gain insights into their customers. Reporting may include ad metrics such as impressions, clicks, and conversions. This data allows an Advertiser to determine if an ad is not performing well (customers are not clicking on it), so that the Advertiser will be able to see that data and update the ad.</li>

		You have the right to request that ArtsAI disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 6 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will disclose to you: (i) the categories of personal information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you; (iii) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information, if any; (v) the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); (vi) if we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing: (a) sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and (b) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.<br />
		</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Deletion Request Rights.</span>
		You have the right to request that ArtsAI delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: (i) complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; (ii) detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; (iii) debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; (iv) exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; (v) comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.); (vi) engage in public or peer-reviewed research in accordance with Section 1798.105 (d)(6) of the CCPA; (vii) enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us; (viii) comply with a legal obligation; or (ix) make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.<br />

		<p class="privacy__text">You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 6-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
		<ul class="stress">
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Response Timing and Format.</span>
		We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 6-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<br />
		</li>
		<li class="privacy__text"><span class="privacy__bold-span">Non-Discrimination.</span>
		We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: (i) deny you goods or services; (ii) Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; (iv) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<br />
