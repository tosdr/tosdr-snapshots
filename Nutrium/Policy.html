Introduction</h2><p class="tw-mb-2.5"><strong> Healthium â€“ Healthcare Software Solutions, S.A. </strong>("Healthium") is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Customers. As provider of services used by nutrition professionals and enterprises, Healthium strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by Healthium to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and transmit ePHI for Healthium Customers.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium provides secure cloud-based software and services based on a software as service (SaaS) approach.</p><h3 class="title">1.1 Software as a Service</h3><p class="tw-mb-2.5">SaaS Customers utilize the Nutrium software and service ("Platform") for the provision of nutrition consultations, simplification of complex tasks such as planning, analysis and creation of food plans, nutritional measurements and calculations, information management and analysis, and much more. In doing so, these customers use the Platform as their main nutrition management software and are deployed into an online compliant environment run on systems secured and managed by Healthium. Unless absolutely necessary, Healthium does not have insight or access into individual use of the Platform or the data inserted by Customers and, as such, in this specific regard does not have the ability to secure or manage risk associated with user level vulnerabilities and security weaknesses resulting from the incorrect use of the Platform. Having said this, Healthium makes every effort to reduce the risk of Costumer's HIPAA non-compliance, controlling as much as possible factors related to disclosure, access, and/or breach of SaaS Customer data through numerous measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, strict password policies, and others.</p><h3 class="title">1.2 Compliance Inheritance</h3><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium provides compliant software services for its Customers and, although it has not yet been through a full HIPAA compliance audit by any independent third-party to validate and map organizational policies and technical controls to HIPAA rules, it takes every possible measure to ensure that every aspect of HIPAA is being properly enforced.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its Customers. These BAAs outline Healthium's obligations and Customer obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing services that comply with the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA, Healthium ensures various aspects of compliance for Customers. The aspects of compliance that Healthium ensures for Customers are inherited by Customers. In doing so, Healthium helps Customers achieve and maintain compliance, as well as mitigates Customers' risk, but please be aware that the use of the Platform does not, in any way, ensure HIPAA compliancy by itself.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium does not act as a covered entity. When Healthium does operate as a business associate (not a subcontractor), it does not interfere with users to obtain or provide access to ePHI.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, Healthium Customers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of Healthium.</p><h3 class="title">1.3 Healthium Organizational Concepts</h3><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The physical infrastructure environment is hosted at Azure. The network components and supporting network infrastructure are contained within the Azure infrastructures and managed by Microsoft. Healthium does not have physical access into the network components.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Within the Healthium platform and supporting services all data transmission is encrypted. Healthium assumes all data<em> may </em>contain ePHI and provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">It is the responsibility of the Customer to restrict, secure, and assure the privacy of all ePHI data at the User Level, as this is not under the control or purview of Healthium.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium has implemented strict logical access controls so that only authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The database servers, where the ePHI resides, can only be accessed through secure connections. Access to the databases is restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only those personnel with a business-justified reason.</p><h2 class="title">2. Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports</h2><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, where applicable, with Customers on a case by case basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA between Healthium and the party to receive the materials. Audit reports can be requested by Healthium's workforce members for Customers or directly by Healthium Customers.</p><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The following process is used to request audit reports:</p><ol class="tw-list-decimal tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Email is sent to <a class="link-green" href="mailto:dpo@nutrium.com">dpo@nutrium.com</a>. In the email, please specify the type of report being requested and any required timelines for the report.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium staff will log an issue with the details of the request into the Healthium Quality Management System. The Healthium Quality Management System is used to track requests' status and outcomes.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Healthium will send one for execution.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Healthium staff will move the issue to "Under Review".</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Healthium Data Protection Officer must Approve or Reject the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Healthium will notify the requesting party that we cannot share the requested report.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If the issue has been Approved, Healthium will send the customer the requested audit report and complete the Quality Management System issue for the request.</p></li></ol><h2 class="title">3. Policy Management Policy</h2><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Healthium workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.</p><h3 class="title">3.1 Applicable Standards</h3><h4 class="title">3.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework</h4><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security</p></li></ul><h4 class="title">3.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule</h4><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">164.316(a) â€“ Policies and Procedures</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">164.316(b)(1)(i) â€“ Documentation</p></li></ul><h3 class="title">3.2 Maintenance of Policies</h3><ol class="tw-list-decimal tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">All policies are stored and updated to maintain Healthium compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR and other relevant standards and legislations.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Policy update requests and suggestions can be made by any workforce member or Customer at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer (depending on the policy) to assure they are accurate and up to date.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium employees may request changes to policies using the following process:</p><ol class="tw-list-decimal tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Healthium employee initiates a policy change request by creating an Issue in the Healthium Quality Management System. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using Healthium's change management process (9.4).</p></li></ol></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium Customers may request changes to policies using the process described in 2., with the necessary adaptations.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">All policies are made accessible to all Healthium workforce members.</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Security Officer or Privacy Officer communicates policy changes to all employees via email or Slack. These communications include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Version history of all Healthium policies is done via Excel.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Backup storage of all policies is done with Google Docs.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to Healthium's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Healthium management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:</p><ol class="tw-list-decimal tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Security of Privacy Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the Healthium Quality Management System.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current Healthium policies.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Healthium utilizes Quality and Project Management Software and frameworks like Trello and other tools to track compliance with HIPAA and other standards and legislations. In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, Healthium uses the following process to track audits, both full and interim:</p><ol class="tw-list-decimal tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Security or Privacy Officer initiates the audit activity by creating an Issue in the Healthium Quality Management System.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The Security or Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the activity. Once the activity is completed, the Security or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If the review is approved, the Security or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Compliance with annual compliance assessments is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in 5.3.1.</p><h2 class="title">4. Risk Management Policy</h2><p class="tw-mb-2.5">This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of Healthium's information security risk management process.

The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.</p><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 1. System Characterization</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Platform boundaries are identified.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Characterization of the Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 2. Threat Identification</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources from historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., are reviewed to help generate a list of potential threats.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 3. Vulnerability Identification</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization's computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization's computer network.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 4. Control Analysis</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Healthium to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 5. Likelihood Determination</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 6. Impact Analysis</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Healthium's mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 7. Risk Determination</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (&gt;10-50) or high (&gt;50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 8. Control Recommendations</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization's operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 9. Results Documentation</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="title">4.3.2 Risk Mitigation</h4><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.</p><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 1. Prioritize Actions</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Actions ranked from high to low</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a "most appropriate" control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - list of feasible controls</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 4. Select Control(s)</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Healthium's mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Selected control(s)</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 5. Assign Responsibility</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training, and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[square]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Prioritized actions;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Required resources for implementation of selected controls;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Team member responsible for implementation of each control;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Start date for implementation;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Target date for completion of implementation;</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Maintenance requirements.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals' time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Healthium Management.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that assigned resources carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list of deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Step 7. Implement Selected Controls</p><ul class="tw-pl-10 tw-list-[circle]"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.</p></li><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Output - Residual Risk documentation</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="title">4.3.3 Risk Management Schedule</h4><p class="tw-mb-2.5">The two main components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Healthium's information security program:</p><ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-10"><li><p class="tw-mb-2.5">Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of Healthium's information system infrastructure will be conducted annually.
