	   	  Summary:  Our website does not collect, sell or share personal information.
	      
	    </h5> 
		    
		    
		      <h4>Our Website Privacy Policies Explained: </h4>
			  	
				
			<h5> Your Data...  </h5> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* We are very serious about privacy. We do not believe 
				ANYONE has any rights to your personal or business information 
				without your permission . Many tech website applications are&nbsp; a facade for a 
				data collection website. &nbsp; You have probable heard the saying: "If the web
				application is free then you are the product". <br>
				There is a watchdog organization's&nbsp; website, where you can get a privacy score for any website 
				on the internet at:&nbsp; 				<a href="https://www.privacyscore.org">privacyscore.org </a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				It allows you to enter the name of website&nbsp; in the white 
				box and then you will need to give it a few minutes to process 
				the the report. The report is very revealing, especially the 
				first 5 category listings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the 2nd list , which 
				lists all of the third party known trackers&nbsp; having 
				software on the website. 
				The list&nbsp; reveals who the website is&nbsp; intentionally 
				partnered with (through software built into their website). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
				<br>
				The internet search company: Startpage.com has a browser add-on that will provide you a realtime privacy score:	 <a href="privacy.jpg"> See the screenshot of our score </a> 
 
			  </ul>
			  <br>


			<h5> Cookies  </h5> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* We do <b>not </b> use cookies -&nbsp; Cookies are used to store 
				data. On some websites it may be used for non 
				evasive data storage purposes, which may be used for their 
				shopping application (if they don't share the data). Read their 
				privacy statement carefully and in most cases you will find that 
				they are sharing your data. If you add script monitoring 
				software to your browser, you will be enlightened to who they 
				are partnering with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often unique identifiers are stored in 
				your browser to identify who you are through your user agent and 
				your IP address. A company called Disconnect makes a&nbsp; 
				browser add-on that lets you control cookies and also 
				see how they are being used. After installing Disconnect, most popup adds will&nbsp; go away.</li>
			  </ul>
			
			<h5> Analytics  </h5> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* We do <b>not </b> use analytics - 
				Analytics are third party software, that is used to track and 
				identify you. It&nbsp; is very rare for a website not to use 
				analytics, since websites may be rewarded for placing this 
				tracking software on a website. &nbsp;If you are 
				interested in identifying who is harvesting your data then there 
				are browser add-ons that will help you identify these scripts.&nbsp; 
				One example being&nbsp; noscript.net&nbsp; You will be floored by the 
				amount of third party tracking that is embedded into most 
				websites. </li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h5> Parts Ordering Software  </h5> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* When you submit an order using our purchase ordering 
				system, there is no data stored. This system is (in effect) 
				identical to sending us an email list of parts that you would 
				like to order. Our ordering software only helps you construct 
				the list that is eventual sent to us as an email when the order 
				is submitted. 
			    </li>
			  </ul>

	<h5> Information that We Collect  </h5> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* We do not Save/Store/Sell/Share any data on or through our 
				website.
			      </li>
			  </ul>

<br>
<h4> Offline Information that we Store  </h4> 
			 <ul class="collection">
			    <li>* Your business shipping / billing information's is obtained 
				through the information that you intentionally&nbsp; provide to us through phone 
				conversations and emails. This information is entered into our accounting 
				software and is used to process your orders and balance your 
				account. We do not use or share your information for any other 
				purpose. Credit card information is not stored by our company. 
				This information is processed through a credit card processing 
				provider and is stored as encrypted tokens using their PCI 
				compliant/secure software and server. After the credit&nbsp; card 
				data has been entered into processing provider's system, we are 
				able to view only the last 4 digits of the card along with the 
				expiration date. This application is hosted/operated&nbsp; and stored 
				on their PCI&nbsp; compliant/secure/banking server. Our website, 
				server (or any of our office computers) do not store your card data.</li>
