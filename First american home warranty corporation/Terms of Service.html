These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without application of conflict of laws rules. Venue for all claims not subject to arbitration shall be in state or federal courts located in Orange County, California.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Resolution of any Dispute</span>. <strong>This provision constitutes an agreement to arbitrate disputes on an individual basis.

This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, all disputes and claims between you and FAHWC. This agreement to arbitrate applies to you and FAHWC, and their respective parent and subsidiary companies, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors and successors in interest, assigns, heirs, spouses, and children. <strong>As noted above, a party may elect to bring an individual action in small claims court instead of arbitration, so long as the dispute falls within the jurisdictional requirements of small claims court.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Any arbitration must take place on an individual basis, and you and FAHWC agree that each is waiving any right to a jury trial and to bring or participate in a class, representative, or private attorney general action, and further agree that the arbitrator lacks the power to consider claims for injunctive or declaratory relief, or to grant relief affecting anyone other than the individual claimant.</strong></p>\n<p>The arbitration is governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. FAHWC will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration it initiates and for any arbitration initiated by another party for which the value of the claims is $75,000 or less, unless an arbitrator determines that the claims have been brought in bad faith or for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of AAA fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will take place in Orange County, California or in the county in which you reside. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, applicability and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Exception</span>. Any claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader or injunctive relief arising out of a claim shall not be subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Additional Terms</h2>\n<p>Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. We may assign our rights and duties under these Terms of Use to any party at any time without notice to you.

Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>\n<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Site and the FAHWC Services. These Terms of Use supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and us regarding this Site and the FAHWC Services.
