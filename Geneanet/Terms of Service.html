<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When registering, each Geneanet user will choose a username and password. The user cannot choose a username that is already in use or which has already been used. The username is unique to the member. The member will systematically be asked to provide this username when using the Site in order to identify him/her and to provide him/her with a personalized response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The username chosen by the user must comply with French legislation and more particularly, with legislation relating to public policy and morality. Furthermore, the user shall not publish any controversial messages, political or otherwise, through his/her username. Whether a username is considered controversial or otherwise shall be determined by Geneanet at its sole discretion.</span></p>
<p><b>Password</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user shall choose a personal and confidential password. The user is solely responsible for the use of his/her password. The user undertakes to keep his/her password secret and not to disclose it in any form whatsoever.</span></p>
<h4><b>4.2.3. Duration of Registration</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User registration is for an unlimited period, notwithstanding the fact that each party may unilaterally terminate, at any time, without having to give a reason and without penalty, the present contractual relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, in the event of non-compliance with these Terms and Conditions</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the user, Geneanet reserves the right to delete the corresponding Geneanet account without notice, and, in the case of a paid-subscription account, without penalty or reimbursement of any amount whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Use of the Accounts</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member can open as many Geneanet accounts as he/she may wish, provided that each account created with Geneanet corresponds to as many registrations, with a separate username and password allocated for each account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of his/her information is accessible via the âMy Accountâ menu on the Site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of the accounts is exclusively for non-commercial purposes, except with the express prior approval of Geneanet, to the exclusion notably of any solicitation or attempted solicitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the user (including Premium Members) undertakes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to only access the Site using an ordinary web browser and solely to carry out personal or professional research;</span></li>

The Premium Member undertakes not to disclose his/her Geneanet log-in information to third parties.

<h3><b>5.2. Fair Use</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Geneanet Premium subscription gives access to all public data provided on the Site (except information contained in family trees to which access has been restricted by the owners and which they use for personal purposes only).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information is provided to Premium members for their personal or professional genealogical research only, within the limits defined at articleÂ 4.2.3.</span></p>
<p><a href="#DÃ©but">(back to top)</a></p>
<h2><a id="Hosting"></a>6. <b>Hosting of Genealogical Data</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneanet provides tools and hosting space to allow its Users to conduct Genealogy research. In this respect, Geneanet notably offers users the possibility of creating their family trees and of searching various historical collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Geneanet is not the data publisher of this data, in particular when Geneanet did not create the Family Tree in question, it is considered as a host pursuant to articleÂ 6-1-2 of the French Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loi pour la confiance dans lâÃ©conomie numÃ©rique</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><b>6.1. Family Trees</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The genealogical data is published on Geneanet, host of the family trees, under the responsibility of the member, who shall alone ensure the data is used and published in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneanet offers two levels of family tree privacy to allow a member to publish their genealogy while respecting the privacy of their living contemporaries, through the two following options: âSemi-Publicâ (information apart from first name and surname, filiation and /or relationship is hidden (dates, photos, places and notes), or âPrivateâ (living persons are not displayed)Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The member must choose the appropriate level of privacy depending on the persons they enter in their family tree. Living persons have the right to access, correct and delete data concerning them in any family tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an account which created a family tree is inactive for more than three years, Geneanet reserves the right to make any correction that it may consider appropriate.</span></p>
<p><b>6.2. Personal Archive Collections</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneanet provides multiple archive sharing services on its Site allowing contributors to share their personal archives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A âpersonal archiveâ is any digitized or transcribed document, of genealogical or historical interest (hereinafter, âcontributionâ), for which the member owns the rights of reproduction and exploitation, and which can be freely published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These files are published under the sole and full responsibility of the member. It is notably the memberâs sole responsibility to ensure that they have the relevant rights with respect to these personal archives, and in particular, the consent of the persons identified or identifiable in these published archives, of which Geneanet is only a host. Any document published which does not comply with applicable legal and regulatory provisions (in particular, those relative to dates for release of public archives and to the conditions for communication and use as defined by the terms and conditions of the public or private archive services which held it; or those relative to compliance with privacy policy provisions) or which infringes intellectual property rights owned by a third party, shall be deleted by Geneanet, from the moment it becomes aware of such non-compliance or infringement. To this end, the member must cite the source of the information and documents published on the Site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneanet reserves the right to enter into business partnerships (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">contrats de partenariat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with other genealogy service providers for the purposes of sharing and/or enriching this indexed data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should however be noted that the database belonging to Geneanet is not physically transferred to its partners, so use of the data is limited solely to access by the Users of the genealogy service.</span></p>
<p><a href="#DÃ©but">(back to top)</a></p>
<h2><a id="Will"></a>7.Â <b>âGenealogical Data Legacyâ Service</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the data and research of members that is online at the time of their death will remain online. However, Geneanet offers its members the possibility of declaring their wishes concerning the future of their family tree and associated documents in the event of their death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to declare their wishes in the event of their death, members can tick the relevant box found on the page âMy Genealogical Profile / Genealogical Data Legacyâ. In addition, a member can write a message for the attention of their heir(s). This message will be held by Geneanet exclusively for such purpose, and will be sent to the relevant heir(s) on his/her (their) request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member can thus choose to leave their data and research online after they die. This decision is binding as against Geneanet (without prejudice to the provisions of the article hereof concerning the case of total cessation of the service) and for information purposes with respect to the heir(s), in addition to the legal provisions mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accordance with articleÂ 85 of the French Data Protection Law (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loi Informatique et LibertÃ©s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) dated JanuaryÂ 6, 1978, following the death of a member, his/her heir(s) may, subject to proof of their identity and inheritance rights, require that the death be recorded and that the personal data of that deceased member be updated (within the meaning of articleÂ 2 of the French Data Protection Law dated JanuaryÂ 6, 1978).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a memberâs account being deleted, certain data, particularly the collaborative genealogical data published by the respective member, will remain accessible on Geneanet. This includes, for example, old postcards, photos of tombs or monuments, family crests, and records.</span></p>
<p><b>8.2. Non-Commercialization of Membersâ Genealogical DataÂ </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âNon-commercializationâ means that Geneanet undertakes NOT TO SELL to third-party companies the information submitted freely and free of charge by its members via the sharing services as defined in article 6 of these Terms and Conditions proposed by Geneanet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the avoidance of doubt, ânon-commercializationâ does not prevent Geneanet from using the information submitted by its members to set up services or options reserved for its Premium members, such as research, notifications or matches.</span></p>

Messages not conforming to the guidelines may be subject to modification, deletion and/or the exclusion of the member concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user expressly recognizes that forums are exclusively for sharing information between, and for providing assistance to, other users, relating to genealogy. Users undertake not to use the forums for any other purposes (particularly political and religious) and shall refrain from using controversial usernames or profile images and any behavior that may be judged as damaging to the convivial nature of the service.

<h2><a id="Forum"></a>10. <b>âGeneanet Mailboxâ Service</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneanet provides a messaging system, of which it is the owner, for its members to allow them to exchange messages relating to genealogy in an exclusively non-commercial context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All messages sent by a member to a single addressee via the Siteâs internal messaging system is considered a private correspondence, for which the sender of the message is solely responsible. Geneanet cannot be held responsible for the contents of private messages between members sent via the internal messaging system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cases of abuse or misuse of the messaging system (notably by sending âspamâ aimed at canvassing, in the event of insulting language, harassment or any other form of prejudicial behavior that compromises the harmonious use of the Services) Geneanet reserves the right to delete the account of an offending member 24 hours after having notified that member by email or internal message.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this respect, the user undertakes to indemnify Geneanet for and against any claims and/or actions and/or complaints based directly or indirectly on this information and/or data, which may be brought against Geneanet. In particular, the user undertakes to bear the cost of any payments whatsoever, which may be claimed from Geneanet, or payments which Geneanet may be ordered to make by a Court decision, including lawyersâ fees and court expenses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present Terms and Conditions constitute the entire and sole agreement between the parties. In particular, it replaces and cancels any earlier agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by French law. Unless otherwise provided by mandatory provisions of public policy, and where conciliation has failed, the relevant Courts of Paris shall have jurisdiction to settle any disputes related to the validity, interpretation or performance of these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in the French language and, as the case may be, translated into other languages for information purposes only. In the case of difficulty of interpretation, the French version alone shall prevail.</span></p>
