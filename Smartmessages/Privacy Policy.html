            <h1>Smartmessages.net Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This is our general privacy policy; each account holder has their own more specific version of this document.</p>
            <h2>Who does what?</h2>

            <p>Synchromedia Limited (the creator of Smartmessages.net, &quot;We&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) is a <em>data
                    controller</em> for Smartmessages.net account holders, and is also a <em>data processor</em> for
                those account holders, handling mailing list subscriber data on their behalf.</p>

            <h2>Privacy policy for Smartmessages.net account holders.</h2>

            <p>If you have a Smartmessages.net account, this is you. Synchromedia Limited is your data controller, you
                are bound by Smartmessages.net <a href="/tandc.php">terms and conditions</a>, and also have privacy
                rights as described below.</p>

            <h2>Privacy policy for Smartmessages.net list subscribers.</h2>

            <p>If you subscribe to a mailing list belonging to a Smartmessages.net account holder, this is you. Hi ðŸ‘‹!
                The account holder is your data controller, and is in charge of your privacy. We act as a data processor
                for account holders, so much of what we do for them is directly relevant to you. Account holders use
                their Smartmessages.net account to manage the mailing lists that you can join. Account holders may also
                provide your data to other services (we do not); you will need to refer to their own privacy policy for
                further details.</p>

            <h2>When do we collect data?</h2>
            <p>We collect subscribers personal data for our account holders when subscribers subscribe to mailing lists.
                We may also be given subscriber data by account holders, for example when they upload their mailing
                lists. Account holders can choose to have us collect message open and click data from actions performed
                by subscribers, if their browser settings allow us to (see <a href="#donottrack">Do Not Track</a>)</p>
            <p>We collect data on account holders when they sign up for a Smartmessages.net account, and use it to run
                their account, inform them of changes, deal with billing, system updates, etc.</p>

            <h2>What data is collected?</h2>
            <p>We collect email addresses and any other personal data that subscribers choose to provide. We must be
                able to prove opt-in status of subscriptions, so we record IP addresses, referrer URLs, and user agent
                strings when subscribers confirm subscriptions to enable us to do that.</p>
            <p>Account holders need to provide us with full contact information as we need to be able to provide that
                information to subscribers.</p>
            <p>IP addresses are logged where we need to be able to protect against abuse, trace system problems, or
                defend against attackers, for example in account logins or password resets.</p>

            <h2>Why do we process data?</h2>
            <p>We are contracted to provide mailing list services to account holders, so we process subscriber data for
                them on the basis of contractual necessity. The overall basis for processing subscriber data lies
                between the subscriber and the account holder, and is most often (given that this is a marketing
                context) based on consent or legitimate interest (for example if a subscriber is the account holder's
                customer), though there may be other grounds; refer to the account holder's own privacy policy for
                details.</p>
            <p>We process data relating to account holders themselves on a contractual basis; they are our customers,
                and we need to store and process their data in order to do what they are paying us to do, and to help
                them uphold up their responsibilities as data controllers.</p>

            <h2>Privacy rights</h2>
            <h3 id="sars">Subject Access Requests</h3>
            <p>The right for subscribers to have access to their personal data lies with account holder(s), however, as
                their data processor we provide a way for subscribers to access, amend, or delete personal data as part
                of our services to them. Data about a subscriber may be stored by more than one Smartmessages.net
                account holder, and the right of access extends to all of them. Subscribers can access all of their
                personal data via our <a href="https://www.smartmessages.net/subscriber.php">subscriber data access portal</a>.</p>
            <h3>Data portability</h3>
            <p>Individual subscriber data can be exported in a machine-readable format (usually
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>) from our subscriber data access
                portal so that you can provide it to another service, or to inspect it yourself.</p>
            <h3>Complaints</h3>
            <p>Subscribers and account holders may object to our use of personal data in several ways (in order of
                convenience):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use our unsubscribe links â€“ <em>they really work</em>!</li>
                <li>Make use of our <a href="https://www.smartmessages.net/subscriber.php">subscriber data access portal</a> to view,
                    amend, export, or delete personal data.
                </li>
                <li>Ask us at <a href="mailto:support@smartmessages.net">support@smartmessages.net</a> to deal with your complaint.
                </li>
                <li>Ask the account holder (the data controller) to deal with the complaint (their contact details
                    appear on every interaction subscribers have with them via Smartmessages.net).
                </li>
                <li>Ask <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">the UK Information Commissioner&#39;s Office</a> (the
                    applicable supervisory authority) to intervene on your behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Data adequacy</h2>
            <p>The only information we <em>need</em> from subscribers is an email address, and so that is the only data
                that we require when subscribing to a mailing list. Subscribers are free to provide more personal data,
                and there may be opportunities for them to do so, but it is entirely voluntary.</p>
            <p>When sending email for marketing purposes, the responsible data controller must be clearly identified, so
                the account holder's contact details are made available whenever subscribers interact with us, such as
                when subscribing to a mailing list.</p>
            <p>We record IP addresses, referrer URLs, and user agent strings when subscribers confirm subscriptions to
                mailing lists because we are required to retain this information in order to be able to prove opt-in
                status, so it is exempt from <a href="#donottrack">our Do Not Track handling</a>.</p>
            <p>We do not store or process any "special category" data, as described in GDPR article 9, such as ethnic
                origin, political affiliation, medical records, etc. Though it is not covered by article 9 anyway, we do
                not store data on gender.</p>
            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            <p>We hold subscriber data for as long as subscriptions remain active. If open and click activity is
                recorded (see <a href="#donottrack">Do Not Track</a>), that data is kept for 6 months, and is then
                deleted and only appears in aggregated statistics. We may use a lack of recorded activity to
                automatically delete subscriber data so that we do not retain it for longer than is necessary or
                relevant.
            <p>Data relating to subscribers that request a subscription but do not complete an opt-in confirmation is
                deleted after 1 week.</p>
            <p>We retain unsubscribe data so that we can suppress future attempts to add subscriber address back onto
                mailing lists other than by their own request (for example by uploads of outdated lists by account
                holders).</p>
            <h2>Third parties</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not share any personal data nor sell it to any third parties</strong>. We do not permit the
                use of bought-in mailing lists; read
                <a href="https://info.smartmessages.net/2016/04/dont-buy-that-list/">this article</a> for why.</p>
            <h2>Cookies &amp; trackers</h2>
            <p>For the most part, <strong>we use no cookies at all</strong>. When necessary, we use only secure,
                first-party session cookies, containing no identifiable data, that are deleted as soon as you close your
                browser window. Since these are strictly necessary for the operation of our site, we do not ask for
                consent (in accordance with PECR). We do not use any third party services that require cookies. We don&#39;t
                use any tracking scripts either; you&#39;ll find all our sites are unpolluted by google, facebook, and
                other trackers.</p>
            <p>Account holders may use third-party tracking on their own sites, but they are outside our control.</p>
            <p>Smartmessages.net can (optionally) add analytics tracking parameters to clickthrough URLs,
                however, this only tells the destination web site where the traffic came from in general terms, and does
                not include any personal data.</p>
            <p>We strongly recommend using an ethically-run tracker-blocker extension such as
                <a href="https://better.fyi">Better</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">uBlock
                    Origin</a>; both are entirely compatible with everything we do.</p>
            <h2 id="donottrack">Do Not Track</h2>
            <p>We honour <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com">the standard &quot;Do Not Track&quot; mechanism</a> built
                into browsers, which is usually controlled by a browser setting labelled something like &quot;Ask
                websites not to track me&quot;. When this is set, we still record activity (typically message opens and
                clicks), but anonymously, without recording anything that would allow us to link to or identify an
                individual subscriber, such as their email or IP address. For reference, your current web browser has
                this setting <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
            <p>There are two exceptions to this: we are required to retain proof of opt-in confirmation, so we record IP
                address, referrer URL, and user agent string when you confirm a subscription to a mailing list in order
                to do that; We record IP addresses during logins so we can combat abuse and attempted break-ins.</p>
            <h2>Profiling and automated decision making</h2>
            <p>We don&#39;t do any of that.</p>
            <h2>Data security</h2>
            <p>We have extensive security measures in place in order to keep your data safe. This includes using strong
                encryption wherever feasible, enforcing strong passwords, using 2-factor authentication, using servers
                in secure data centres, and ensuring that only authorised staff can access data. Bear in mind that you
                provide personal data at your own risk; nobody (including us) can guarantee 100% security. We may
                sometimes send you email messages that contain important links, such as if you need to reset a password
                or confirm a subscription; you should treat these as confidential, much as you would a password. You can
                <a href="https://wiki.smartmessages.net/#Security">read more about our security measures</a>.</p>
            <h2>Physical location</h2>
            <p>Our servers are located in London. We host at
                <a href="https://www.equinix.co.uk/locations/united-kingdom-colocation/london-data-centers/">Equinix</a>&#39;s
                Sovereign House and Harbour Exchange data centres in London&#39;s docklands, one of the UK&#39;s premier
                hosting locations, featuring multiple redundant network connections, clean, reliable power supplies,
                overspecified air conditioning, and heavy physical security (retinal scanners etc). Our hosting provider
                is <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/">Mythic Beasts</a>.</p>
            <p>We perform some processing and host various resources (for example, our web site and help pages) on
                servers in France, hosted by gandi.net in Paris, but this does not involve personal data.</p>
            <p>We will never export personal data out of the EU.</p>
            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p>To help defend against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a>, account holders can
                set up a page on their own web site that points back to us, and this can be used to assure subscribers
                that we are really acting for the account holder, and not pretending to be them.</p>
            <h2>Data breach procedures</h2>
            <p>GDPR and PECR require reporting of personal data breaches; Under PECR, we are
                classed as a &quot;Service Provider&quot;. Breaches can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unauthorised third-party acccess.</li>
                <li>Deliberate or accidental action by a controller or processor.</li>
                <li>Revealing personal data to an incorrect recipient.</li>
                <li>Alteration of personal data without permission.</li>
                <li>Loss of availability of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Should a breach occur relating to subscriber data, we will inform the relevant account holder(s) (the
                data controller) by email to their account addresses, and it is their responsiblity to communicate with
                subscribers, if necessary.</p>
            <p>The applicable supervisory authority is the <a href="https://ico.org.uk">UK Information Commissioner&#39;s
                    Office</a> (ICO).</p>
            <h2>Applicable laws</h2>
            <p>As we are a UK company, we are subject to the
