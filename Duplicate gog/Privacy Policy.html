<h3>7. WHY DO WE USE YOUR DATA? (LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DATA PROCESSING)</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>7.1. When we process information about you, we do so as necessary to provide GOG services you use (i.e. to perform agreement between us, enable you to play GWENT or use GOG GALAXY features), meet our legal obligations (f.ex. tax, accounting) or to fulfill the so-called “legitimate interests” of GOG or other reasons described in the “How we use your data” section. To clarify, by legitimate interests we mean lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected (like informing you about games we distribute and making sure our marketing is relevant for you, protecting the security of our websites and systems, conducting anti-cheat analysis and anti-fraud checks). When we rely on the legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes we will ask for your consent and you will be entitled to withdraw this consent any time, with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>In essence, we process your data to provide you with GOG services, to meet our legal obligations and for other reasons that are important for us like informing you about our games and ensuring security of our website. In other cases, we will ask for your consent in advance and you will always have the right to withdraw it anytime you like.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>7.2 When we transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area, we do so on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “Trusted Partners”.<br /><br /></p>

<p>11.1 GOG services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties (e.g. to games developers whose games are on GOG). In addition, third parties (e.g. games developers/publishers) may also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. your email address or name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. This may include saving information to your GOG profile in relation to their games (such as, for example, saving game progress). Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies. This also applies to GOG GALAXY integrations created by the community.</p>
