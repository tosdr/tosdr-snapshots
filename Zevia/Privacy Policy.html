This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p><h3>A. Right to Access Personal Information and Data Portability Right</h3><p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p><ul><li><p>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</p></li><li><p>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</p></li><li><p>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</p></li><li><p>The categories of third parties with whom we disclose that personal information.</p></li><li><p>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the business purpose for which personal information was disclosed, and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p></li><li><p>The categories of personal information that we sold or shared and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the information</p></li></ul><p>You also may request that we inform you of specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you. In some instances, you may request that any of this information be provided to you in an electronically portable format.</p><h3>B. Right to Delete</h3><p>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. If we cannot delete all of your personal information, we will let you know why.</p><h3>C. Right to Correct Inaccurate Information</h3><p>If you believe that any of the personal information, we hold about you is not accurate, you may submit a request for us to correct that information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the information according to your request.</p><h3>D. Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing</h3><p>You may opt out of the sale of your personal information or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising.

Exercising Your Rights</h3><p>To exercise the access, data portability, correction, opt-out, or deletion rights described above, please submit your request to us:</p><ul><li><p><a href="/data-subject-request-form">Via webform</a>; or</p></li><li><p>Via toll free number at: 855.GO.ZEVIA (855.469.3842)</p></li></ul><p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</p><p>The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will reach out to you for additional information as necessary for us to verify your identity. If you are submitting on someone else&#x27;s behalf, we may ask you and/or your representative for additional verification. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request.</p><p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&#x27;s identity or authority to make the request.</p><p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p></div></div><div id="refund-policy"><h2>REFUND POLICY</h2><div><p>Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t accept returns or exchanges of product.

PRODUCT PURCHASES</h3><p>Product purchases made through this website are subject to our Terms of Sale set forth below in this Section 14 (the &quot;Terms of Sale&quot;). Please review the Terms of Sale carefully prior to making a purchase through the website. The Terms of Sale are incorporated by reference in these Terms.</p><h4>Terms of Sale</h4><p>These Terms of Sale apply to the purchase and sale of products through the Services and are subject to change by Zevia without prior written notice at any time, in our sole discretion. By placing an order through the Services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to the Terms of Sale in their entirety and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to the Terms of Sale, please do not order any product through the Services. Any exclusions and limitations of liability listed below in Section 16 and any disclaimers listed in Section 18 shall apply to these Terms of Sale.</p><h4>General Requirements</h4><p>By placing an order, you represent and warrant that:</p><ul><li><p>You are at least 18 years of age (19 in Alabama and Nebraska; 21 in Mississippi);</p></li><li><p>If you are an individual consumer, the product is being ordered solely for your personal use, and you will not market, resell or otherwise distribute the product to any third party for commercial purposes;</p></li><li><p>If you are a business, the product is being ordered on the Services solely to promote your own products or services by distributing the product to your customers and others at no cost to the recipient as business gifts or advertising items. You will not resell the product.</p></li></ul><h4>Product Descriptions</h4><p>We use our reasonable endeavors to make sure that every product available for purchase on the Services is shown accurately and that prices are correct. However, product descriptions, specifications, features and images are subject to change at any time without notice, and occasionally there may be small variations in color, typefaces and layout. Without limiting any of Sections 16 or 18 below, we do not warrant, represent, undertake or covenant in any way that any product description or related information, material or Content accessible using the Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free, and we are not responsible for errors (typographical or otherwise) in any of the foregoing.</p><h4>Order Acceptance and Cancellation</h4><p>You agree that your order is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all products listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will not be obligated to sell the products or services to you. We may choose not to accept any orders in our sole discretion. When you place an order (by choosing your product and completing the online checkout process), we will send you an order acknowledgement by email. This will detail the products you have ordered. Please note that your completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance of your order only takes place when we ship it. A contract of sale between you and Zevia is therefore made at the point of shipment, rather than at the point of payment. If you have cancelled your order, or if we notify you that we cannot accept your order, then no contract of sale will have been made. From time to time, we may not be able to accept an order, including for the following reasons: (i) where we cannot obtain authorization for your payment; or (ii) if you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in the &quot;General Requirements&quot; section of these Terms of Sale. We reserve the right to cancel your order at any time and issue a full refund. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of products to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction.</p><h4>Prices and Payment Terms</h4><p>All prices posted on the Services are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email. We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors.</p><p>Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and payment must be received by us before our acceptance of an order. We accept major credit or debit cards, PayPal, Shop Pay, or Google Pay for all purchases. You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.</p><h4>Shipments; Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss</h4><p>We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process. Orders containing multiple items may be shipped separately.</p><p>Title and risk of loss pass to you upon delivery. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments. If any of the details you have given us in your delivery address are incorrect, we are not liable for any items which are not received.</p><h4>Circumstances Beyond Our Control.</h4><p>Neither we, nor any courier or carrier service that we use, shall be liable for any failure to perform under these Terms, where such failure or delay results from any circumstances outside our reasonable control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, adverse weather conditions, such as snow, flood, extreme winds, fire, explosion, accident, traffic congestion, obstruction of any private or public highway, acts of governmental authorities, pandemic, riot, terrorism, act of God, or from any industrial dispute or strike.</p><h4>Subscribe and Save Program Terms</h4><p>If you enroll in our &quot;Subscribe and Save&quot; subscription program when you place an order for Products through the Services, you are: (i) signing up for and agreeing to <b>automatic, continual shipments</b> (each, a &quot;Subscription Order&quot;) of all such Products that are eligible for the subscription program (&quot;Subscription Products&quot;) in accordance with the schedule you select during checkout; and (ii) expressly authorizing Zevia to charge your payment method on a recurring basis as set forth herein without further affirmative authorization from you. Subscription Products may be eligible for an additional percentage discount on Zevia&#x27;s everyday low prices. You may change your Subscription Order shipping schedule, shipping method, shipping address and payment method and the Subscription Products included in your Subscription Orders at any time (provided that such changes will not apply to any Subscription Order authorized in accordance with these terms prior to Zevia&#x27;s receipt of your change request). Such changes may be made by signing into your account on <a href="https://www.zevia.com/">https://www.zevia.com</a>  and selecting the &quot;Manage Subscriptions&quot; link under Account Details or Order History.</p><p><b>Your subscription program (and the associated Subscription Orders) will continue until canceled by you (provided that such cancellation will not apply to any Subscription Order authorized in accordance with these terms prior to Zevia&#x27;s receipt of your cancellation request). You may cancel at any time by signing into your account on </b><a href="https://www.zevia.com/"><b>https://www.zevia.com</b></a><b> and selecting the &quot;Manage Subscriptions&quot; link.</b></p><p>When you place your initial Subscription Order, your payment method will be charged and the Subscription Order will be processed immediately. For each subsequent Subscription Order (which will be placed automatically per the schedule you have selected), at least three days prior to the date you are scheduled to be charged, you will receive a pre-shipment email notification reminding you of your upcoming shipment that includes (i) the prices for the Subscription Products in the applicable Subscription Order, as well as all applicable discounts, taxes, fees, shipping charges and other charges (collectively, the &quot;Total Fees&quot;), (ii) the period during which you may request changes to the applicable Subscription Order, and (iii) the scheduled shipment date. Following your receipt of such notification, you may edit or cancel such Subscription Order through our website, <a href="https://www.zevia.com/">https://www.zevia.com</a>, until 11:59 pm. Eastern Time on the day immediately preceding the applicable shipment date. If you do not cancel the Subscription Order by such time, the Subscription Order will be deemed authorized, and a credit card authorization hold will be placed on your payment method in the amount of the Total Fees. You will see a pending charge during this time as we process the Subscription Order. Once your Subscription Order is processed and shipped, your payment method will be charged for the Total Fees. Note that a payment authorization hold is not an actual charge, and although the hold may appear on your payment method account, you will be charged only one time for each Subscription Order. A payment authorization hold may impact the amount of credit available to you under your payment method. Any credit balances you may have on your subscription program account may be applied toward the balance of your order and Zevia will charge the remaining balance to your payment method. If we are unable to process payment, you will receive a &quot;card declined&quot; notification. If a valid payment method is not updated within the account, our system will wait a day and then send out an additional notification each day, for up to 8 days. If a valid payment method is not updated within the account after the 8th day, you will receive an email cancelling the Subscription Order, any active subscriptions, and removing any pending charges.</p><p>Zevia reserves the right to change or cancel the &quot;Subscribe and Save&quot; program (or any element or benefit thereof, including without limitation eligible Products, Subscription Product prices, discount amounts, delivery schedule and delivery method options, payment method options, and terms and conditions applicable to the program), at any time, with or without notice to you (provided that Zevia will not change prices for a Subscription Order that has been authorized in accordance with these terms). You expressly acknowledge and agree that certain elements, benefits and offers of your subscription program may change over time (for example, prices, discounts, availability, shipping charges and taxes), and Zevia does not guarantee that any of the foregoing will remain the same during your subscription program. All Subscription Products are subject to availability. Zevia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any Subscription Order or terminate your subscription program at any time, with or without notice to you, including without limitation due to an invalid payment method. Your subscription program is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred to any third party. Your subscription program, and all Subscription Orders and Subscription Products, are subject to all terms and conditions set forth under &quot;Terms of Sale&quot; above and all other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.</p><h4>Refund Policy</h4><p>Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns or exchanges of product. If your order was damaged in transit, or if you&#x27;ve received the wrong order, please reach out to our Customer Care team immediately, by emailing <a href="mailto:shop@zevia.com">shop@zevia.com</a> or calling 1.855.GO.ZEVIA (1.855.469.3842), and we will either send you a replacement or offer you an equal exchange credit. If you believe there is a quality issue with your product, please take note of the Lot Code (a series of numbers with a timecode that is printed near the Expiration Date), so that we can trace the specific batch of product you have received. These inquiries will be handled on a case by case basis.</p></div><div><h3>15.
