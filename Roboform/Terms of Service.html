PRIVACY POLICY:

Personal data of Customers that purchase RoboForm licenses 
is stored on Siber servers in the data center located in USA.

The data stored consists of data that customers or their agents 
enter into the RoboForm license purchase web page and
data collected from Customer's computers 
by License Activation and Monitoring.

Customer hereby allows Siber to store such data on Siber's servers.
This data shall be used for purchase, refund and chargeback tracking, 
activation and reactivation of RoboForm licenses, 
and other customer service purposes.

Personal data stored on Siber servers shall not be sent
to other companies or individuals, except for cases 
when sending of such data is required by Siber business processes 
or for enforcement of this License Agreement and 
recipient of data is not expected to divulge or misuse received data.
For instance, credit card purchases require sending personal
Customer data and his credit card data to Credit Card processor
and such data sharing shall be allowed under this clause.

Customer allows Siber to send infrequent product 
update newsletters and promotional offers
to the e-mail and postal addresses stored by Siber,
but Customer shall have an option to unsubscribe

that is shown when user installs new version of RoboForm.


ONLINE LICENSE ACTIVATION AND MONITORING: 
Customer hereby agrees to Online License Activation and Monitoring 
process for all RoboForm licenses (Pro, Subscription-Based).

Customer also agrees that Online Activation and Monitoring 
will be  used to enforce provisions of this Agreement.

in older versions) for its new versions approximately once a day. 
If it finds a version that is newer than the version that you have, 
RoboForm will offer you to upgrade. 
The checking of new version results in various data related to computer 
and license to be transmitted to Siber server and maybe stored on this server.
Customer hereby allows such transmissions to occur.


PERSONAL DATA IN ROBOFORM WITHOUT SYNCHRONIZATION:
NO TRANSMISSION, NO RECOVERY.

All Password Data that Customer enters into RoboForm
is stored only locally on Customer's computer if Customer 
does not use option to Synchronize RoboForm.
In this case RoboForm does not transmit any Password Data over the Internet.  

However, if Customer or a program running on Customer's 
computer causes RoboForm to fill an online form with such 
personal data, then submission of this form will result 
in this data being sent over the Internet but 
this shall be deemed not to be caused by RoboForm.

Customer agrees that deletion or loss of Password Data entered 
into RoboForm  will cause irreversible loss of the said Password Data
and Customer accepts the risk of such loss.


PERSONAL DATA IN ROBOFORM WITH SYNCHRONIZATION:
DATA TRANSMITTED, RECOVERY POSSIBLE.

If Customer uses Synchronize RoboForm option then
Customer Password Data is stored locally on 
Customer Computer or portable disk and on RoboForm server.
If local copy of user data is lost, Customer may obtain 
copy of this data from RoboForm server.

However, availability of backup copy is NOT guaranteed 
by Siber and Siber shall NOT be held liable, 
if it cannot produce copy of Customer's RoboForm data.
Customer is hereby encouraged to keep multiple copies of 
RoboForm user data on his/her computers, disks and devices.

Also in this case RoboForm  shall transmit RoboForm Password Data
over the Internet, for the purposes of storing backup copy of 
Customer RoboForm Password data on RoboForm server and 
for purposes of synchronization of said data between Customer computers 
and mobile devices. Customer hereby authorizes such transmission.
