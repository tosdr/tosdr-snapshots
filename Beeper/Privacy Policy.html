We will never profit by monetizing your data but instead seek to fulfill our company mission by delivering a great product &amp; service.<br/><br/>Our commitment to privacy and data protection is reflected in this Privacy Statement which describes how we collect and process “personal information” that identifies you, like your name or email address. Any other information besides this is &quot;non-personal information.&quot; If we store personal information with non-personal information, we’ll consider that combination to be personal information.
