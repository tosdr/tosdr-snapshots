To use Beeper, you must give Beeper permission to send and receive messages through other chat networks on your behalf.</p><p>By using Beeper, you are adding another software system between you and people you chat with. This may be less secure than chatting directly on a single chat network, especially for encrypted chat apps like Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage.</p><p>Beeper Inc is not affiliated with any other chat networks. You must follow the respective terms and guidelines of each chat network while using Beeper, and Beeper Inc is not responsible for your conduct or associated consequences on a connected chat network.</p><h4>How Beeper Keeps You Safe:</h4><p>Beeper upholds privacy and security by fighting against ads, trackers and other impingements on privacy. We will never profit by monetizing your data.</p><p><strong>Beeper Mini: </strong>We designed Beeper Mini from the ground up to give you the highest levels of security and privacy. Beeper Mini connects directly to 3rd party chat services. There is no external dependency on Beeper cloud infrastructure to send and receive messages. Messages are protected with end-to-end encryption before being transmitted. Message history, contact lists, account credentials and encryption keys are stored locally and never leave your device.</p><p><strong>Beeper Cloud</strong>: We have gone to great lengths to protect your privacy and security, including encrypting message contents and attachments with end-to-end encryption before messages are stored on our servers. This means that Beeper employees cannot read your message history after it is stored on our servers.</p><p>Beeper cares about transparency and choice. You have the option of self-hosting chat app networks, which can provide a greater level of encryption and security while using Beeper.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://beeper.com/faq">beeper.com/faq</a></p><h4>Beeper&#x27;s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service:</h4><p>Our commitment to privacy and data protection is further reflected in our Privacy Policy: <a href="https://beeper.com/privacy">beeper.com/privacy</a>.
