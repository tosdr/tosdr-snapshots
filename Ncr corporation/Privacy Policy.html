NCR Voyix also may use Contract Data to facilitate compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.</li><li><strong>Deidentified Data.</strong> For deidentified or aggregated data, which was formerly Personal Data, but which can no longer identify individuals, NCR Voyix may conduct research and development, statistical, trend or pattern analysis in order to continuously improve our products, services, processes, and security procedures.</li><li><strong>Sales and Marketing.</strong> NCR Voyix may use your Personal Data for sales and marketing purposes, including contacting you for feedback in customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes, providing you with marketing literature on products and services, notifying you of events, and providing you with information about NCR Voyix . You may always change your privacy preferences as set forth below. From time to time, NCR VOYIX may co-brand an offering or a communication with a third party, which may also collect your Personal Data. In such cases, the use of your Personal Data by such third parties is covered by their respective privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy. In cases where you choose to forward a page from this website to another individual (where such option is available), NCR Voyix may request certain Personal Data about that individual to complete your request, such as name and email address, but NCR VOYIX will not make further use of such information. NCR Voyix&#x27;s use may include, but is not limited to, making sales calls, sending marketing communications, delivering or completing requested services or transactions, and tracking and analyzing a series of transactions.</li><li><strong>Social Networking Tools.</strong> If NCR Voyix uses social networking widgets or tools to provide information to you, your information will be governed by the terms of use and the privacy policy for the applicable social networking platform.</li><li><strong>Fulfilling Business Transactions.</strong> NCR Voyix may use your Personal Data to fulfil business transaction requests with you or your organization.

If, in providing service or support (including support to assist you with the use of our websites or applications), we engage you telephonically or via electronic communications through tools such as email or online chat, we may monitor or record our interactions for purposes of quality assurance, training, or to document the details of the interaction or transaction.</li><li><strong>Recruitment. </strong>If you seek employment with NCR Voyix , you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may utilize automated processing techniques for candidate applications for qualitative scoring or ranking to optimize the efficiency of our recruiting practices. In such cases, however, this Processing is overseen by our Human Resources personnel. We may use this information throughout NCR VOYIX to consider you for employment purposes and may keep your information on file for future consideration, to support NCR Voyix&#x27;s compliance with applicable legal requirements, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in a separate notice that may be provided to you. </li></ul><h5>Transfers</h5><p>‍</p><p>NCR Voyix is a global company with global operations, partners and suppliers. Where it is necessary for the efficient and effective performance of a business transaction or the fulfilment of one of the uses of Personal Data outlined above, NCR Voyix may need to transfer Personal Data from the country of collection to other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. Where such a transfer is made from one country or territory to another that is not deemed by the first exporting country (“Exporting Country”) to offer an adequate level of protection to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, NCR Voyix&#x27;s policy is to do so on the basis of contractual controls between the relevant group companies, partners, or suppliers designed to ensure that substantially the same level of protection is afforded to the Personal Data as in the Exporting Country. NCR Voyix&#x27;s contractual safeguards are based on the ‘standard contractual clauses’ issued by the European Commission and other data protection regulatory authorities of the Exporting Country.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</h5><p>‍</p><p>We may share your Personal Data (including Contract Data) with the following categories of third parties:</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Affiliates. </strong>We may share Personal Data within NCR Voyix.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may share Personal Data with third-party suppliers and service providers that help us Process Personal Data.
