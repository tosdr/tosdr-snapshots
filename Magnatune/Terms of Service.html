<p>
<b>Governing Law.</b> 
<p>
The laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, 
govern these Terms and your use of the Site and Services. Your use of the Site 
and Services may also be subject to other local, state or federal laws. You 
expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with

<p>
<b>Notices.</b>
<p>
Magnatune may send you notice with respect to the Site or Services by sending an 
e-mail message to the e-mail address listed in your account information, by 
sending a letter via postal mail to the shipping address listed in your account 
information, or by a posting on the Site. Notices shall become effective 
immediately when posted to the Site and upon delivery when sent by e-mail or 
postal mail.

<p>
<b>Miscellaneous.</b>
<p>
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Magnatune and govern 
your use of the Site and Services, superseding any prior agreements between you 
and Magnatune. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that 
may apply when you use third-party content or third party-software. If any part 
of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed 
in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, 
the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain 
in full force and effect. Magnatune's failure to enforce any right or provision 
in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other 
provision of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the other provisions will remain in full 
force and effect. Magnatune will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any 
obligations due to causes beyond its control. No agency, partnership, joint 
venture or employment is created as a result of these Terms. All provisions of 
these Terms which by their nature should survive termination will survive 
termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty 
disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
