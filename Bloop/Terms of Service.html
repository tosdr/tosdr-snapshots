<!-- -->Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the &quot;Agreement&quot;). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services, and this Agreement will apply to any changes.</p><h2>1. Who&#x27;s Who</h2><p>&quot;You&quot; means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you&#x27;re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person&#x27;s or entity&#x27;s behalf, that by using using our Services you&#x27;re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us. We refer to BLOOP AI LIMITED as &quot;bloop&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; throughout these Terms.</p><h2>3. Your Account</h2><p>When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response. We may limit your access to our Services until we&#x27;re able to verify your account information, like your email address. When you create a bloop account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don&#x27;t worry --- if you aren&#x27;t interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it&#x27;s an email, phone call, or text message. You&#x27;re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You&#x27;re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We&#x27;re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. If you get fired because of a blog post you write about your boss, that&#x27;s on you. Don&#x27;t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it. If you&#x27;d like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy.</a></p><h2>5.

We may limit your access to our Services until we're able to verify your account information, like your email address. When you create a bloop account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don't worry --- if you aren't interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message. You're solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You're also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We're not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. If you get fired because of a blog post you write about your boss, that's on you. Don't share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.
