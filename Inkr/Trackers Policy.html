Rights / additional rights which may be available to you as per The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you are domiciled in the EU region.</strong></p><p>  a) <strong>Right to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR):</strong> This right provides you with the ability to withdraw a previously given consent for processing of your personal data for a purpose.

Thereafter, we will destroy or delete the information, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, unless its retention is required to satisfy legal, regulatory, accounting or other business requirements or to protect our interests. We will however periodically review the data we hold, and erase or anonymise it when we no longer need it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy of children</strong></p><p>If you are an individual who is less than 16 years old (<!-- -->&quot;<!-- --> <strong>Child</strong>&quot;<!-- --> or <!-- -->&quot;<!-- --> <strong>Children</strong>&quot;<!-- -->), please do not send us any information or your personal data / information.
