These Terms and Conditions of Use (<b>Terms</b>) govern your access to and use of the Site, and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloadced or appearing on the Site (collectively referred to as <b>Content</b>).</p>
<p>Your use of the Site is conditional upon your agreement to, acceptance of and compliance with the terms and conditions set out below (including our Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines) and the Terms are legally binding on you.

The materials are protected by Australian and international copyright laws.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>For increased anonymity, you may wish to set up an email account with an email provider who does not require you to enter any Personal Information to create the account.

<ol>
<li>identification of the copyright work said to have been infringed;</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>1. That either:</strong></p>
<p>(a) the Works contain no third party content (including music or images); or</p>
<p>(b)the user has obtained licences to include any third party content in the Works and to upload it to the Site, and holds the necessary rights to grant the Licence; and</p>
<p><strong>2. That any person</strong> appearing in the Works consented to the use of their name and/or image and/or voice in the Works, the uploading of the Worksto the Site and the granting of the Licence;</p>
<p>(together, the <b>Warranties</b>).</p>
<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify Vent and keep Vent, its officers, directors, employees, servants, agents, licensors, licensees and suppliers, indemnified from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable legal fees, resulting from any breach of these Terms, the Warranties or any activity related to use of the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person using your registered account.</p>
<p>As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Vent account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>
<h2>License to Vent</h2>
<p>By using and placing any Works on the Site you grant Vent and its affiliates a world-wide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to use the Works in any manner and in any medium, at Vent’s sole discretion, including to reproduce, transmit, distribute, adapt, publicly perform and display the Works subject to the Privacy Policy (through all media now known or hereafter created) (<b>Licence</b>).</p>
<p>You expressly waive in favour of Vent any moral rights or similar rights you have in any jurisdiction in respect of the Works. If requested by Vent you agree to enter into any further agreements necessary to document the licence and waiver set out above, at Vent’s expense.</p>
<p>You further grant all users of the Site permission to view your content for their personal, non-commercial purposes. If you make suggestions to Vent on improving or adding new features to the Site, Vent shall have the right to use your suggestions without any compensation to you.</p>

<p>Each user of the Site is responsible for the content he or she uploads to the Site. We do not actively monitor content and will not censor user content, except in the limited circumstances described above and in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You can file a report that someone is uploading abusive, objectionable or threatening content to the Site either directly within the application or by emailing your report to <strong>moderator@vent.co</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your report, we will review the reported user account, including any particular Vents that have been reported. If the Vent user has violated any of our policies set out in these Terms, we will take action, ranging from removing the reported content &amp; warning the responsible user up to permanently suspending the user account of the person responsible for uploading the content.</p>
<p>If someone has used the Site to threaten or intimidate you, you should report the threat to the police so they can accurately assess the legitimacy of the threat. Vent does not have the ability to investigate and assess a threat, bring charges or prosecute individuals. If the police contact Vent to investigate a threat, we can work with them to provide the required information for their investigation.</p>
<h2>Variation and Termination</h2>
<p>These Terms shall continue to have full force and effect until varied or terminated by Vent. Vent reserves the right to terminate this agreement and your access to the Site at any time for any reason or for no reason.  The Terms relating to intellectual property, your licences to Vent, the indemnity granted by you, and all disclaimers and limitations of liability shall survive the termination of this agreement.</p>
<p>Vent reserves the right to vary these Terms at any time, including by posting new or varied Terms on the Site. You will be given the opportunity to accept such varied Terms on your first visit to the Site after such variation occurs, and if you elect not to accept the Terms as varied your permission to use the Site will terminate immediately.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.</p>
<p>If any provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, such invalidity or unenforceable shall not affect the remainder of the agreement which shall continue to have full force and effect.</p>
<p>The waiver by Vent of a breach of these Terms by you shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach of these Terms by you and shall not in any way restrict Vent’s right to exercise its rights pursuant to this agreement in respect of any other breach of these Terms.</p>
