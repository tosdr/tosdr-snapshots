            <strong>11.3. Limits in use</strong><BR>
            11.3.1. Fair Usage Policy of ShortPixel Hosting: ShortPixel Hosting offers hosting plans bundled with limited and unlimited resources like disk space and/or other resources, such as data transfer, databases etc. The use of the Service is governed by a Fair Usage Policy, stated below, which covers the fair use of bandwidth and other resources where there is an indication of "unmetered/unlimited" data transfer or storage capacity, in order to prevent Service abuse and allowing the Company to fully optimize network capacity, as well as maintain the quality of the Services.<BR>
            If a website is identified to consume too many resources, we will try to contact the User (owner) to discuss possible solutions. Until such solutions shall be implemented, the use of the Service can be limited at the discretion of the Company.<BR>
            Disk space is intended for use in accordance with ShortPixel Hosting’s Fair Use Policy and limited to web files, active email and User Website content only. Shared hosting space may not be used for storage, including without limitation, of media, emails, as offsite storage of electronic files, or FTP hosts. ShortPixel expressly reserves the right to review every shared account for excessive usage of CPU, disk space and other resources that may be caused by a violation of this Agreement or the Fair Use Policy. ShortPixel may, in its sole discretion, terminate access to the Services, apply additional fees, or remove or delete User Content for those accounts that are found to be in violation of ShortPixel's T&C.<BR>
            Excessive Server Resources: Use of ShortPixel’s resources must be consistent with a shared hosting environment and must otherwise comply with this T&C. Accounts with a large number of files can have an adverse effect on server performance. Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of database tables or an excessive database size negatively affect the performance of the server. In the event that you exceed these amounts, ShortPixel may request that you reduce the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total databases to ensure optimal server performance. ShortPixel reserves the right to terminate your account, with or without notice, for excessive use of resources that result in a degradation of server performance or the Services.<BR>
            11.3.2. Fair Usage Policy of ShortPixel Image Optimizer: This policy prevents Service abuse, allowing us to fully optimize the capacity and maintain the quality of our Services. The Unlimited Plan is intended for personal use only and is subjected to the Fair Use Policy. Sometimes a single website can take up more than 5% of our Image Optimization Cloud capacity by using (but not limited to) huge images (over 10K pixels width/height), manipulated images designed to artificially load the system, or many images that require a lot of CPU processing power for being generated/optimized (e.g. WebP/AVIF). We consider such usage as unreasonable and abnormal, and affecting our Services. If a website is identified to consume too many resources, we will try to contact the User (owner) to discuss possible solutions and, until such solutions shall be implemented, the use of ShortPixel Image Optimization Cloud will be limited.<BR>
            11.3.3. Visitors may post reviews, comments or other content on the Website as well as other communications and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, discriminatory, racist, containing hate speech or similar, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing on intellectual property rights or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings or any form of "spam".<BR>
            11.3.4 The Company reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, if detected. Also, the Company reserves the right to limit your use of the Services in duly justified cases, such as the cases detailed above.<BR>
            11.4. Suspension and Termination of Accounts<BR>
            We may monitor your account and the conduct of your account (but we have no responsibility to do so) to determine whether you and all User Websites of ShortPixel Hosting, if applicable, are complying with these T&C.<BR>
            The Company and its Affiliates reserve the right to refuse Service, suspend or terminate accounts, remove or edit content or cancel orders with immediate effect without prior notice, if:<BR>
            - we believe that your use of the Service may be in breach of any law;<BR>
            - we believe that you or a User Websites of ShortPixel Hosting has committed a breach of this T&C;<BR>
            - we believe that your use of the Service may compromise or have an adverse effect on our systems or networks;<BR>
            - when there is any business justification to do so.<BR>
            The Company reserves the right to ban your domain/account from our servers and/or CDN immediately, without notice, and block further access for that domain/account in the cases mentioned above.<BR>
            If we believe that your use of the Service may be in breach of any law, then we may notify the relevant authorities, and provide them with relevant information as appears appropriate in the circumstances.<BR>
            You agree that you will have no claim against the Company in respect of any action reasonably taken by us under this clause 11.4, and you indemnify the Company against any claim by a User or User Websites or any other third–party arising out of the same.<BR>

            The Company&rsquo;s Referral Program allows registered Users to earn credits by referring friends to ShortPixel. To participate in this program, Users must agree to the terms below.<BR>
            16.2.1. EARN IMAGE CREDITS<BR>
            i. Users can earn credits if (i) a referred friend clicks on their referral link and creates a valid ShortPixel account that complies with our Terms and Conditions; and (ii) the referred friend completes the sign-up process and starts using ShortPixel Hosting or ShortPixel Image Optimizer.<BR>
            ii. The referring User will be credited with the specified ShortPixel Hosting or ShortPixel Image Optimizer credits.<BR>
            iii. Credits may not be earned by creating multiple ShortPixel Hosting or ShortPixel Image Optimizer accounts. Credits accrued in multiple ShortPixel accounts may not be combined into one ShortPixel account.<BR>

            16.2.2. REFERRAL LINKS<BR>
            Referrals should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes, and only shared with connections that will appreciate receiving these invitations. Referral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that the recipients are personal connections (such as coupon websites, Reddit, or Wikipedia).<BR>
            16.2.3. REFERRED FRIENDS<BR>
            i. Referred friends that have signed up using a valid referral link for ShortPixel Image Optimizer will also receive additional image credits. The standard amount is 100 one-time images but may vary in some cases if the referred friend signed up as part of a special promotion. Varying credit amounts and additional terms will be shown in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials.<BR>
            ii. The same website domain cannot be associated with multiple referral friends&apos; accounts. This prevents the artificial creation of several ShortPixel User accounts, for optimizing the same website.<BR>
            iii. A referred friend may only use one referral link.<BR>
            iv. The referee needs to optimize at least 50 images in order for the bonus credits to be applied.<BR>
            16.2.4. LIMITATIONS<BR>
            i. The Company may suspend or terminate the Referral Program or a User&rsquo;s ability to participate in the Referral Program at any time if a justification may be provided in this regard.<BR>
            ii. Requirements and incentives may also change at any time, with prior notification to the Users.<BR>
            iii. We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove referrals if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent.<BR>
            iv. We reserve the right to review and investigate all referral activities and to suspend accounts or cancel or modify referrals, as necessary.<BR>
