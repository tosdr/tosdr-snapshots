<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>I.&nbsp; Acceptance &amp; Terms of Use</h4>
<p><span>You must register for an account in order to access and take advantage of the Services. By registering for and using the Services you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these T&amp;Cs. If you are a natural person, then you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the majority age of your state of residence, to register a BenefitHub account and use the Services. If you are a business or other entity, then your business or entity must be registered or organized in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to be eligible to register and use the Services.</span></p>
<p><span>By accepting these T&amp;Cs, you are representing and warranting that you have the legal capacity to be bound, or to otherwise bind your affiliated business or entity, to the terms and conditions contained herein. If you do not agree with any of these T&amp;Cs, do not register for, access, or otherwise use the Services. Furthermore, downloading and using the Mobile-App constitutes your agreement to be bound by the then current terms displayed in the Google or Apple app- store. We reserve the right to revise these T&amp;Cs and any of the policies listed below from time to time. Each revised version will be published on the Website and made available through the Platform. By continuing to use our Services after any change are made, you agree to be bound by such changes. If you do not agree with any changes we make to these T&amp;Cs, then you must rescind your consent and close your account by providing us with written notice. These T&amp;Cs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Our <a href="https://www.benefithub.com/privacy-policy-global?hsLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> <span>and <a href="https://www.benefithub.com/cookie-policy-global?hsLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>;</span></span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Our Legal Notice, Disclosure, and Consent Policies; and</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>A binding agreement to resolve any dispute between you and us by binding arbitration on an individual basis;</span><br><span>A general release by you of all claims for damages against us that may arise out of or relating to your use of the Services, interactions, or purchases with third-party Discount Providers, or stemming from your relationship or affiliation with a Sponsor.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>II. <span>Description of the Services</span></h4>
<p><span>The Services are comprised of a rich collection of resources, including access to a variety of lifestyle and voluntary benefits, discounts on goods and services marketed by third-party merchants and service providers (“<u>Discount</u> <u>Providers</u>”), communications tools, personalized content, and branded programming. The Services we provide are made available to you and your Sponsor free of charge. We are able to provide the Service for free by sourcing and marketing deals from Discount Providers that provide you with commercial value. When you make a purchase from a Discount Provider, we may receive a commission or revenue share, which enables us to support and further expand the Services.</span></p>
<p><span>In sourcing discounts and deals from Discount Providers (each an “<u>Offer</u>”), we rely on the material representations made and information provided by such Discount Providers, which include, but are not limited to descriptions, content, marketing materials, pricing, availability, unique terms or conditions, eligibility criteria, disclaimers, and any other information related to an Offer that is displayed on the BH Tools. We attempt to verify and ensure that the information provided to us by Discount Providers is accurate, but do not represent or warrant that any Offer information displayed on the BH Tools is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If you believe an Offer is inaccurate or </span><span>misleading upon being redirected to a Discount Provider’s website (each a “<u>Third-Party Site</u>”), then you should notify us in writing and provide reasonable detail of the Offer or information at issue. Offers are often provided to us by Discount Providers in the form of a unique coupon code or affiliate link to a co-branded Third-Party Site. These codes and links are reserved for use by you and other registered users of the Services and should not be posted externally or otherwise shared. Posting, disclosing, or otherwise sharing Offer links and codes outside of the BH Tools may result in the termination of your Account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>III. <span>Your Account &amp; Use of the Services</span></h4>
<p><span>Upon registering for the Services, you will be prompted to provide the following information: (i) your personal or Sponsor affiliated e-mail address; (ii) your first and last name; (iii) your password; and (iv) certain consents and preference information (collectively, your “<u>Account Registration Information</u>”). You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Account Registration Information and to update such information as necessary while you continue to use the Services. Your Account Registration Information will be stored by us to establish and manage your account (“<u>Account</u>”), which you may use to login and use the Services. Your Account is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. We reserve the right to eliminate portions of, or make changes to, the Services at any time.</span></p>
<p><span>Subject to your compliance with these T&amp;Cs, we grant you, through your Account, a limited, revocable, non- exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal non-commercial use of the Services. Your right to access and use the Services is subject to our <a href="https://www.benefithub.com/privacy-policy-global?hsLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a><span>, <a href="https://www.benefithub.com/cookie-policy-global?hsLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>, and all updates or additions thereto which are posted on the Website during your use of the Services.

The Services and BH Tools, or any portion thereof, may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express prior written consent. Any right not expressly granted to you in these T&amp;Cs, or under the polices stated herein, are reserved, and retained by us, or our suppliers, licensors, or other content providers. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of ours, or use any meta tags, or any other "hidden text" utilizing our tradename or trademarks without our express written consent.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Access to the Services may be interrupted from time to time due to third-party service provider failures outside of our control (such internet infrastructure failures and hosting services failures).

<h4>VII. <span>BenefitHub Cash Back Points</span></h4>
<p><span> When you engage with certain Offers or purchase certain EProducts (including clicking on third party links or using available coupon codes), you may earn rewards points with an assigned monetary value (“Cash Back Rewards”). Cash Back Rewards are awarded after the completion of certain actions through the Services, such as making a purchase or completing a transaction on an eligible Third-Party Site. The availability of Cash Back Rewards for each Offer will be clearly indicated on the BH Tools. Once you accumulate the equivalent of at least $5.00 in Cash Back Rewards, as indicated by the balance displayed on your Account on (the “Balance”), you may redeem your Cash Back Rewards for a gift card on the Website or direct PayPal transfer payable to you in United States Dollars in an amount equivalent to your Balance. You will be required to provide additional information necessary to verify <u>and link</u> your <u>PayPal account</u>, if you elect to redeem your Balance <u>via PayPal transfer</u>. If you elect to exchange your Balance for gift cards, the types of gift cards may vary based on your location, specifically where the Services are being provided outside of the United States, or where an Issuer does not offer products for a particular region or market. You acknowledge and understand that gift cards are subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations placed on such gift cards by the Issuer providing them and all such gift cards will be subject to each Issuer’s own terms of service. </span></p>
<p><span>Our ability to provide Cash Back Rewards to you is interdependent on the occurrence of a completed purchase or successful referral occurring with a participating Discount Provider. As such, we only provide Cash Back Rewards to you after you successfully complete a purchase or action on an eligible Offer, product, or service and the Discount Provider managing such Offer, product, or service receives payment. If a Discount Provider does not receive payment, you refund payment, or we do not receive payment from the participating Discount Provider for the particular action or transaction, then we reserve the right to withhold allocation of any Cash Back Rewards related to that transaction. This includes instances where there are difficulties in tracking a transaction due to your use of an ad-blocker, disabling of tracking cookies, or interaction with another affiliate program. Where there is a discrepancy related to your eligibility to receive Cash Back Rewards in relation to a transaction, we may require you to provide copies of your order confirmation, order number, or other proof of purchase. You must have an active Account to be eligible to earn Cash Back Rewards.</span></p>
<p><span> Your Balance may expire under the following circumstances: (1) you fail to login to your Account for a continuous period of three calendar years rendering your Account inactive; or (2) three calendar years after the expiration or termination of your Account or your Sponsor’s agreement with BenefitHub (your “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance Expiration Date</span>”). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you fail to claim your Balance by your Balance Expiration Date, then you will forfeit your remaining Balance and release all claims related thereto. Furthermore, you agree that any disputes relating to your eligibility to receive Cash Back Rewards or the expiration of your Balance will be resolved by us in our sole discretion, and you agree to abide by our resolution. </span></p>
<p><span> To prevent instances of abuse or fraud, your account may become ineligible to participate in the Cash Back Rewards program if tracking your transactions becomes an issue or multiple discrepancies related to your eligibility arise.

<h5>E.&nbsp; <span>Agreement to Arbitrate</span></h5>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><span>You expressly agree not to bring any action or claim as a plaintiff of a representative class or class member in any proceeding or representative action against us. By accepting these T&amp;Cs you expressly agree that any and all claims or disputes that arise between the Parties, including, without limitation, any claims based on consumer rights, federal or state statute, contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively binding arbitration, except for claims that qualify for small claims court, and provided that any such matter remains in small claims court and advances on an individual, and non-class or representative, basis.</span></p>
<p><span>Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the arbitral proceedings shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “<u>AAA</u>”) in accordance with its then current rules and procedures, except as modified by this Section(X)(E). In the event that the AAA is unable to administer the arbitral proceedings, the Parties will mutually select another administrator or rely on a court’s selection. The cost of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be split equally between the Parties, unless the total relief sought is $10,000 or less, in which case we will pay all filing administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. You must submit a request for our payment of fees along with any demand you make. If the arbitrator determines that the claim(s) you assert are frivolous, then you agree to reimburse us for all fees we paid in association with the arbitral proceedings that you would otherwise have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.</span></p>
<p><span>The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English and be held in the county in which you reside or at another location mutually agreed to by the Parties. The proceedings will be administered by one arbitrator mutually agreed to by the Parties or otherwise appointed under the AAA rules. If the total value of relief you are seeking is </span><span>$10,000 or less, then either Party may elect to have the proceedings conducted entirely by telephone, teleconference, through written submission, or any combination thereof, the election of which shall be binding on the Parties, but subject to the arbitrator(s) discretional request to hold an in-person hearing. Where appearing in- person is unduly burdensome or potentially harmful, the Parties agree that such appearance may be satisfied through an appearance via video conference. Any discussions relating to settlement, including settlement offers, shall not be disclosed by the Parties to the arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the substance of each claim in accordance with applicable law, these T&amp;Cs, and ex aequo et bono (from principals of equity and conscience). The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties, and judgment on the award may be entered into any court having proper jurisdiction.</span></p>
