Camfrog expresses no views as to the content of any room and is not responsible for any activities taking place therein. To the extent that you participate in any activity on Camfrog, you do so at your own risk.</p>
    <p class="mb-20">If another Camfrog user attempts to send or sends you a video, photograph, sketch, drawing, graphic or other image or other visual depiction (an "Image" or "Images") and you do not know the user, the Image sent by the user may be inappropriate for the rating of the Camfrog room you are in. Accordingly, you should use your judgment before agreeing to accept an Image. You hereby agree that your acceptance of such Images is at your own risk and you waive all rights of any kind whatsoever in law, equity or otherwise worldwide, and all claims that you could possibly ever assert throughout the world against the Camfrog Parties (hereinafter defined) arising out of, or relating to your acceptance of Images.</p>
    <p class="mb-20">In addition, you should be aware that if you elect to publish, distribute, disseminate, display, post or otherwise make available (hereinafter "Publish") an Image or speak to or send a text message to another user or users ("Chat"), such user or another user may be able to capture, reproduce and/or download the Images and/or Chat and redistribute it (or them) in undesired and/or unexpected forms, manners and/or venues and to persons or entities to whom or which you do not wish the Images or Chat to be distributed. Accordingly, you should not Publish any Images or Chat, unless you are prepared to have the Images or Chat disseminated to a wide audience and to persons and/or entities whom or which you might not want to see the Images or hear the Chat. In addition, all Images, Chats, and other Content may be posted at various times on the Camfrog homepage, landing pages and/or other pages and you consent to same.</p>

No user shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the Terms of Service. Camfrog’s authorized third party content providers (as identified by Camfrog) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service.</p>
    <h3>No solicitation; No denigration</h3>
    <p>As a condition of your use of the Software, you agree that you will not either directly or indirectly (a) solicit, cause, or assist in soliciting or causing, any employee, officer, director, agent, administrator, or any other person that is employed by, consults for, volunteers for, represents or assists Camfrog (each a "Representative") to (i) terminate, suspend, discontinue or end such Representative's employment, consultancy and/or other relationship with Camfrog, or (ii) become employed by, or work or consult for any other entity or person, (b) make any negative, denigrating or defamatory statement(s) or comment(s) about Camfrog or any Representative, or otherwise engage in any conduct or action that might tarnish the image, reputation, ability or character of Camfrog or any Representative, or otherwise tarnish or dilute any of Camfrog's trade or service marks and/or its goodwill; or (c) solicit or cause any existing customer or client of Camfrog to cease using, and/or any potential customer or client of Camfrog not to use any Camfrog products and/or services and/or to use any software and/or other product(s) and/or services that are competitive with Camfrog's products and/or services; (d) aid, abet or authorize any person or entity to engage in any of the foregoing.</p>
    <h3>Room Ratings</h3>
    <p>Group Chat Rooms are "rated" in order to enable users to determine what language and images are appropriate and may be expected. The ratings are guidelines that are enforced by the administrators of each chat room, and are not to be regarded as an assurance that the content will be safe or acceptable to you or anyone under eighteen (18) years of age. For example, in a "All-Ages Rated Room," no foul language is permitted, nor are Images involving adult themes (nudity or violence, for example). In an "18+ Rated Room," you should expect offensive language and content and you must be at least eighteen (18) years old to participate in such a room. Camfrog is not liable for any assumptions that you make when entering any given chat room or for any inappropriately rated chat rooms and you assume all risk in joining any chat room or permitting anyone under eighteen (18) years old to join any chat room.</p>
    <h3>Hosting a Chat Room </h3>

By "RIGHT CLICKING" on the name of the person that is not behaving appropriately, you will see a menu of choices, including: (a) removing that person's ability to speak ("Block Mic"), (b) removing that person from your room ("Kick"), and (c) banning that person from re-joining your room ("Ban"). In addition, you can add the user to your Blocklist, RIGHT CLICK on the user's name and click on "Ignore User," which will prevent the user from contacting you (except if you are in a group with that user). When creating your own room, more information will be available to you. You understand and agree that any room you host and Content thereon may be displayed in whole or in part on any page of the Camfrog site including, at Camfrog's sole discretion, the homepage.</p>
