		<h2>Cyclone Hits Teams</h2>
		<p>Team Leaders can decide who they let in to their team, whether to go private or public, and what kind of rules they want to impose. At any time, they can remove a member from their team. 
		<br /><br />
		At the end of each month the top 3 teams for the following categories will split the jackpot: "Top Overall Surfing", "Top Average Surfing" and "Top Referring".
		<br /><br />
		In the event of a tie, the winnings for the category will be split between the number of teams that are tied for that spot.</p>
		
		
		<div id="surfing"></div>
		<h2>Viewing Other Members Offers (Surfing) & Activity Policy</h2>
		<p>The use of programs or "bots" to automatically surf at Cyclone Hits without clicking is strictly prohibited, and any member who is found using such a program will be suspended. This also applies to members who let someone else log into their account to surf.
		<br /><br />
		Using several windows to surf faster than your timer allows or to save time is strictly prohibited, and any member who is found doing so will be suspended.
		<br /><br />
		Falling below 85% accurate clicks will auto-suspend your account. If this happens and you're a new member and just started surfing, just send a support ticket and I will fix it, but members who have surfed a lot will be suspended if this happens.
		<br /><br />
		Surfing in a minimized window is not allowed and will cause a pop up at each click.
		<br /><br />
		From time-to-time you may receive bonuses from different games and contest on this site, including Team Surfing, which can only be used for onsite purchases such as Account Upgrades or buying Advertising Credits.  There are no cashout payments on these types of activities.
		<br /><br />
		For free members, after 90 days of inactivity credits and impressions that are not assigned will be lost. Upgrading or surfing within 90 days will prevent loss in credits. Accounts older than 90 days will be "suspended". You may "reactivate" your account at any time by submitting a support ticket. </p>

		<p>Cyclone Hits does not permit using the forum, chat, or private messaging system for sending advertisements. Members found using these services to send spam, ask users to join programs, bait members into asking for more information, or in any way using these services for promotion may find their access to the forum, PM system, and chat revoked.
