<p>2.3. The Customer further agrees and acknowledges that access to, and the usage of the Services is subject to specific limits established by <strong>text|</strong>.

The Customer, its Agents and Guest-Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all of the Agent and Guest-User credential information for the Customer’s Account. <strong>text|</strong> may monitor the number of Agents or and Guest-Users allowed under your Account for subscribed Services or features of the Account and to track your usage of the Services to ensure compliance with this Agreement. If you exceed the established usage limits or if <strong>text|</strong> determines, in its sole discretion, that your use is excessive, abnormal or would adversely affect the operation of the Services, <strong>text|</strong> shall be entitled to (i) charge you at the current list price for any additional Services and Account subscription required to cover the excessive usage; and (ii) immediately limit, suspend or terminate your License or any Services. You are solely responsible for the proper protection and storage of assigned password and log-in (credentials). <strong>text|</strong> may, at its sole discretion, provide advance notice before such actions, but is not obligated to do so. You shall be solely responsible for all costs and damages arising from such excessive usage, including any additional charges. The Customer, its Agents and Guest-Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all credential details for the Customer’s Account.</p>
<p>2.4. Guest-Users are granted access for specific purposes, such as training, collaboration, or evaluation, as authorized by the Customer. Guest-User access does not confer the same rights as those granted to Agents and is subject to restrictions as specified by <strong>text|.</strong></p>

<p>2.7. You are also solely responsible for obtaining the authorizations, licenses and consents, if and as required by any applicable law, to make the Services available to End-Users. When you provide any Customer Data to <strong>text|</strong>, you (whether you are the Customer or the administrator operating on behalf of the Customer) represent and warrant that you have full authority to provide us with such Customer Data and its submission and use, as you authorize herein, will not violate (i) any applicable law, (ii) any third-party intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other rights, or (iii) any of your or third-party policies or terms governing your Customer Data.</p>

Parties acknowledge and agree that Services shall be accessible from the moment the subscription process is finalized which commences data processing activities under Account compliant with the <a href="/legal/data-processing-addendum/">Data Processing Addendum</a>.

<p>2.9. The Customer understands and has become familiar with the technical requirements necessary to access and use the Services and has no objections in respect thereof. The Customer is aware of risks and threats connected with electronic data transmission.</p>
<p>2.10. <strong>text|</strong> may make available Supporting Applications via Marketplace. If Customer elects to procure a Supporting Application, the terms and conditions regarding its use or receipt of the Supporting Applications are between Customer and the provider of those Supporting Applications and any exchange of data between Customer and such third party provider is solely between Customer and the applicable provider. Any questions, concerns or disputes that arise based on Customer’s use of Supporting Application should be addressed with the provider of such Supporting Application. <strong>text|</strong> does not warrant, or support Supporting Application, whether or not they are designated by <strong>text|</strong> as developer or otherwise. <strong>text|</strong> is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Supporting Application or its provider. <strong>text|</strong> cannot guarantee the continued availability of any functionality or feature that is made available as the outcome of integration with any Supporting Application and may cease providing them without notice and without entitling the Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation. Use of such Supporting Application remains volunteer for all Customers therefore <strong>text|</strong> considers use of such Supporting Applications as optional and not being a part of Services.</p>
