In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear in your room.</p>
<p>If you find a Watch2Gether room that you believe violates these Terms of Use, please <a href="https://community.watch2gether.com/t/impressum-imprint/594">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>When you create a room on Watch2Gether, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your room and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur in the room and any other actions taken in connection with the room. You must immediately notify Watch2Gether of any unauthorized uses of your room, your Watch2Gether account, or any other breaches of security.

<h2>
<a name="responsibility-of-contributors-5" class="anchor" href="#responsibility-of-contributors-5"></a>Responsibility of Contributors</h2>
<p>If you operate a room, participate in a room, post content into a room, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Watch2Gether, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms.</p>
<p>In particular, it is not allowed to share the following content in a Watch2Gether room:</p>

<li>Content that violates the copyright of others</li>
<li>Content that is not appropriate for the youngest member of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>If you delete Content or a room, Watch2Gether will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Watch2Gether, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Watch2Gether has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Watch2Gether’s sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or room due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Watch2Gether’s reasonable opinion, violates any Watch2Gether policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of Watch2Gether to any individual or entity for any reason. Watch2Gether will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
