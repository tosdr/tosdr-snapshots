&amp; Refunds</h3><div><p>Canary Connect, Inc. (“Canary”) provides certain identified products and services (including our Basic, Premium Services 
      and Professional Monitoring, each, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products"). The Products may include a device or other equipment, 
      that we refer to collectively as "Equipment," and we may provide it to you as part of our Products. If you are the original end-user or 
      purchaser, as applicable, of our Products and you are not satisfied with the Equipment for any reason, you may return 
      it in its original condition within sixty (60) days of the original purchase and receive a full refund, except that 
      Canary does not refund costs for international orders.</p>
      <p>Only Equipment that has been purchased directly from Canary online can be returned to Canary. Equipment purchased 
      through other retailers must be returned in accordance with their respective returns and refunds policy.</p>
      <p>If you wish to cancel an Equipment order or schedule an Equipment return, please contact 
      <a href="mailto:support@canary.is">support@canary.is</a> with
      your order details.</p>
      <p>The above Equipment Return & Refunds policy does not apply to our 
      Premium Services or Professional Monitoring, which we refer to as “Additional Services”. Cancellation terms 
      for Additional Services, including Additional Services with a minimum committed contract period, are included in 
      our <a href="https://canary.is/legal/sales-terms#cancellation">Sales Terms</a> and can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <ul><li>Monthly Additional Services plans may be canceled for a full refund only within three (3) days of initial 
      registration.</li>
      <li>Annual Additional Services plans may be canceled for a full refund only within fourteen (14) days of initial 
      registration.</li>
      <li>Additional Services plans with a minimum contract period may be canceled for a full refund only within fourteen 
      (14) days of initial registration if you return your Equipment within such time.</li>
      <li>Canary does not offer refunds on renewals of Additional Services.</li></ul></div></div><div><h3>Canary Limited Warranty</h3><div><p>If you are the purchaser or original end user of our Products that included Equipment obtained from one of our retail partners, please contact them 
      directly to arrange an exchange or refund before making a claim under Canary’s One Year Limited Warranty.</p>
      <p>BY USING YOUR CANARY HOME SECURITY EQUIPMENT YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE CANARY ONE (1) YEAR 
      LIMITED WARRANTY ("WARRANTY") AS SET OUT BELOW. DO NOT USE YOUR EQUIPMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTY. 
      IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTY, DO NOT USE THE EQUIPMENT AND RETURN IT WITHIN THE RETURN PERIOD AND 
      IN ACCORDANCE WITH CANARY’S RETURN POLICY.</p>
      <p>THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY BY STATE, 
      COUNTRY, OR PROVINCE. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY WILL 
      NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS YOU SHOULD REFER TO 
      THE LAWS APPLICABLE IN YOUR STATE, COUNTRY, OR PROVINCE.</p>
      <p>Canary’s warranty obligations for this Equipment are limited to the terms set forth below:</p>
      <p>Canary Connect, Inc. ("Canary") warrants the Canary Equipment contained in the original packaging against defects in materials 
      and workmanship when used normally in accordance with 
      Canary’s technical specifications and user manual for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of original purchase 
      by the end-user or purchaser, except that if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA) and you purchased Canary 
      Equipment in the EEA, the warranty period is two (2) years from the date of purchase ("Warranty Period").</p>
      <p>If during this warranty period a defect arises and you submit a valid claim to Canary and follow the instructions for 
      returning the Equipment, we will, at our option, either (i) repair the Equipment using either new or refurbished parts, (ii) 
      replace the Equipment with a new or refurbished Equipment, or (iii) refund the purchase price of the Product that included the applicable Equipment. All 
      replacement Equipment assumes the remaining warranty period of the original Equipment or ninety (90) days from the date of 
      replacement or repair, whichever provides longer coverage for you. When Equipment is exchanged, any replacement is yours to 
      use and the replaced item remains Canary’s property. When a refund is given, the Equipment for which the refund is provided 
      must be returned to Canary and it remains Canary’s property.</p>
      <p>To obtain warranty service for any Equipment that is subject to the foregoing warranty, the consumer must notify Canary to 
      obtain a Return Material Authorization ("RMA") and return the defective Equipment together with proof of purchase of the Product that 
      included the Equipment to the address specified by Canary in connection with the RMA.</p>
      <p>This Limited Warranty applies only to hardware Equipment manufactured by or for Canary that can be identified by the "Canary" 
      trade name, or logo affixed to them. This warranty does not apply: (i) to consumable parts, such as batteries, unless failure has 
      occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship of the Canary Equipment itself; (ii) to cosmetic damage, including but not 
      limited to scratches, dents and broken plastic on ports; (iii) defects or damage caused by misuse, accident (including, without 
      limitation, collision, fire and the spillage of food or liquid), neglect, abuse, alteration, unusual stress, modification, 
      improper or unauthorized repair, installation, testing, or improper storage; (iv) to damage caused by operating the Equipment 
      outside the permitted or intended uses described by Canary; (v) to damage caused by use with non-Canary hardware. This Limited 
      Warranty does not apply to any software, even if packaged or sold with Canary Equipment. Canary does not warrant that the operation 
      of the Equipment will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
      <p>This warranty applies only to Canary Products that included Equipment purchased by end users from Canary and its authorized resellers. This warranty 
      is void for purchases made from any other reseller, and Canary offers no warranty for such purchases.</p>
      <p>Canary will use reasonable commercial efforts to deliver the Equipment as described. Canary is not responsible for damage arising 
      from failure to follow instructions relating to the Equipment’s use.</p>
      <p>Consumers in some jurisdictions may have legal rights under applicable national legislation governing the sale of consumer goods, 
      including, without limitation, national laws implementing EC Directive 99/44. These rights are not affected by the warranties in this 
      Limited Warranty.</p>
      <p>The Canary Extended Warranty is subject to and includes all of the provisions set forth above, but extends the warranty term for an 
      additional one-year period. The EEA two-year warranty period noted above is not extended by the Extended Warranty.</p>
      <p>This warranty applies to both new and recertified Canary Equipment</p></div></div></article></div><footer class="Footer_footerContainer__3AKcM"><div
