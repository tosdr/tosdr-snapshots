        <p>Our mission at Canary is to build products that empower people to live fearless lives and make decisions about their safety and security. We believe that providing transparency around the data and personal information you entrust to us is critical to completing that mission. Your privacy and trust are our utmost concern.</p>
        <p>At Canary, we provide (i) our website located at <a href="/">https://canary.is</a> and related domains (collectively, the "Sites"), (ii) software that you may download to a mobile device ("Mobile Apps"), (iii) services accessible through our Sites and the Mobile Apps ("Canary Services") and (iv) home security devices, accessories and other hardware ("Equipment"). We refer to our Sites, Mobile Apps, Canary Services and Equipment collectively as our "Products."</p>
        <p>This privacy policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>") describes how we collect and use personal and other information through our Products and it describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information, how we share your information, and how you can access and update your information.</p>
        <p>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, Canary Connect, Inc. provides this Policy.

        <p>By visiting the Site or using our Products, you understand that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.</p></div></div><div><h3 id="information-canary-collects">Information Canary Collects</h3><div><br>

Besides collecting information from you, we also collect information from the following categories of sources: payment processing, credit evaluation and fraud detection services; and marketing and analytics partners.</p>
        <p>There are two broad categories of personal information that we collect and process: (i) information which you choose to give us or which we require for, or collect or infer from, your registration and use of our Products ("<strong>User Information</strong>") and (ii) audio and video footage and images captured by our Products ("<strong>Video Feeds</strong>").

        <p>If you are located outside the US and Canada, we rely on a number of bases to lawfully collect, use, share, and otherwise process your User Information for the purposes described in this Policy, including where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>necessary to perform a contract we have with you, such as providing our Products in accordance with the legal terms available at <a href="/legal" id="legal">canary.is/legal</a>;</li>
          <li>you have consented to certain processing, which you may revoke at any time;</li>
          <li>required for Canary to comply with a court order or another legal obligation, or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Keeping the Products safe and secure: We use your personal information to try and keep our Products safe and secure. We do so as it is necessary to pursue legitimate interests in ensuring Canary is secure, and to protect against fraud, illegality, spam, misuse and abuse.</li>
          <li>Providing the Products: We use your personal information to provide the Products, including any personalized Products. We do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in providing an innovative and tailored offering to our users on a sustained basis.</li>
          <li>Research and Improving the Products: We work hard to develop, enhance and improve our Products. We may process your personal information in order to further our legitimate interests of learning how we can improve your experience on our Products, and contributing to research.</li>

        </ul></div></div><div><h3 id="choices-to-limit-collection">Choices You Have to Limit Information Collection</h3><div><br>
        <p><strong>Location Services</strong></p>
        <p>Some features of our Mobile App use precise location-based data. If you allow these features, we will locate you using the Wi-Fi routers and the cell IDs of the towers closest to you. We use this information to facilitate the Equipment's automatic mode switching, for customer support, and to provide you with local emergency services contact information. We also may use this information when you use the Safety Button feature of our Mobile App, to provide first responders with your location. You may disable location services within your phone’s settings menu.</p>
        <p><strong>Video & Audio</strong></p>
        <p>You may configure your Canary Product from within the Mobile App to capture video and audio within the camera’s range and provide you with notifications. You can set your Canary Product to different modes from within the mobile app menu. Each mode determines when Canary records audio and video and when you receive notifications and can be customized depending on your settings. You should inform guests of any recording if the camera is on while others are in your home.</p>
        <p>You may enable privacy mode or disable recording from within the Mobile App menu to prevent the recording of video and audio through the Equipment. In privacy mode, the watch live video feature and event notifications are disabled and the camera and microphone are turned off. Your Equipment will continue to monitor environmental activity in privacy mode so we may provide you with aggregated Home Health information. LED lights on the bottom of the Product will be turned off to indicate the Equipment is in privacy mode.</p></div></div><div><h3 id="how-canary-shares-your-information">How Canary Shares Your Information</h3><div><br>
        <p>We will share certain categories of your information with third parties only in certain circumstances as described below:</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Information.</strong>
            <br> Personal information is any information that could be used to directly or indirectly identify you, like your name, email address and image captured by our Products. Both User Information and Video Feeds contain personal information. We only share this information under limited circumstances. Primarily, we share this information with third parties to provide you necessary services or to operate our Products for you. For example, this information is shared on a limited basis to assist in managing the computers that store your Video Feeds and User Information, and to third parties that assist us in providing you with customer support.

            <li><strong>To Protect Us and Others.</strong> We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of this Policy or our legal terms available at <span class="redundant-link" data-url="legal">https://canary.is/legal/</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent.</strong> We may disclose personal information to third parties where you consent to our sharing that information. For example, you may opt to share certain information to post it on social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter, you may link your Canary account with another app or service, or you may opt into providing information to Canary’s business partners to receive special offers. We will never share your personal information for these purposes without your consent, and we never share your Video Feeds for marketing purposes.</li>
