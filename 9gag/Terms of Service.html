It is a leading platform for entertainment content with millions of daily visitors. As used in this EULA, “<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>User</strong></span>” means any user of the Service.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Eligibility</span>.&nbsp; IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13.&nbsp; FOR USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE FOR WHICH RULES APPLY ON A AGE-BASED BASIS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA (“<strong>RESTRICTED AGE</strong>”).&nbsp; IN ALL CASES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY 9GAG.&nbsp; IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE RESTRICTED AGE IN THE TERRITORY WHERE YOU RESIDE, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.&nbsp; Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either you are at least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf.&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Changes</span>.&nbsp; As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service.&nbsp; You therefore agree that 9GAG may change this EULA at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the 9GAG website or within our App. 9GAG will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before continuing to access the Service.&nbsp; You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at <a href="https://about.9gag.com/tos/" target="_blank">https://about.9gag.com/tos/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; The revised EULA will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised EULA.&nbsp;

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or 9GAG must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.&nbsp; If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by 9GAG prior to selection of an arbitrator, 9GAG will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the last written settlement amount offered by 9GAG in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $15,000.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fees</span>.&nbsp; If you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, 9GAG will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the HKIAC Rules.&nbsp; Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in<strong> </strong>Hong Kong, but you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone or videoconference hearing; or (iii) if the claim is for $15,000 or less, by an in-person hearing as established by the HKIAC Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.&nbsp; If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the HKIAC Rules.&nbsp; In that case, you agree to reimburse 9GAG for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the HKIAC Rules.&nbsp; Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision in English sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.&nbsp; Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.&nbsp; The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">12.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">No Class Actions</span>.&nbsp; YOU AND 9GAG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp; Further, unless both you and 9GAG agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">12.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</span>.&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in this EULA, if 9GAG makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to 9GAG’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending 9GAG written notice within 30 days of the change to 9GAG’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and 9GAG.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">12.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Enforceability</span>.&nbsp; If Section 12.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12 &nbsp;is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be null and void.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>13.
