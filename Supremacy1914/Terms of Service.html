They do not apply in respect of the breach of a primary obligation (i.e. a contractual duty, the adherence to which is of special importance to the fulfilment of the contractual objective and on which the client, as a party to this contract, may legitimately rely) or an essential obligation. Bytro Labs’ liability according to the product liability laws and Sect. 44 a TKG remain unaffected.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">12.8 Liability for breach of an essential obligation is limited to the damage which could reasonably have been foreseen. The damage which could have been foreseen is limited to EUR 20,00 per Account.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">12.9 The aforementioned limitations of liability also apply for the personal liability of staff, employees, assistants, vicarious agents, contributors, representatives, organs, shareholders of Bytro Labs and their members. </span></p><p class="bodytext"><b><span lang="EN-GB">§ 13 Further Duties and Obligations of Participants</span></b><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.1 The Participant is aware that he uses </span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB"> the game </span><span lang="EN-GB">together with many other Participants and communicates with different Participants when using the additional services. In order to achieve an enjoyable gaming experience, it is necessary to adhere to the rules of the game. The Participants accept the rules of the game and the ToS as binding. The Participants will follow Bytro Lab’s instructions which will be provided by the game supervisor. Additionally, the Participants will refrain from any conduct which may interfere with the operation of </span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB"> the game </span><span lang="EN-GB">and/or the additional services and which may disturb an enjoyable gaming experience.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.2 The Participants must not use </span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB"> the game </span><span lang="EN-GB">for commercial or illegal purposes.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.3 Bytro Labs is not responsible for any damage or loss of data on the local computer of the Participant which results from the installation of software which was not provided by Bytro Labs.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.4 The Participant is obliged to keep all access data for the game </span><span lang="EN-GB">(login, passwords etc.) strictly confidential. He will promptly inform Bytro Labs if he finds out or suspects that an unauthorised third person is in possession of his access data. The Participant must not use the Account or access data of another Participant. The Participant is aware that in the event that a third party uses the game</span><span lang="EN-GB"> with his access data, through his own fault, the Participant is liable for the fees and for damages. All access through a Participant’s access data shall be considered as an access by that particular Participant himself. Bytro Labs points out that passwords should regularly be changed for security reasons.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.5 In the event that Bytro Labs has reason to believe that an unauthorised third party is in possession of access data, Bytro Labs may, without assuming any responsibility to do so, and always acting at its sole discretion, change the access data without prior notice or block the respective Account. Bytro Labs will promptly inform the rightful Participant and will, upon request, communicate the new access data to him without undue delay. The Participant cannot claim to have his initial access data restored.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.6 Bytro Labs protects its systems against viruses. However, the Participant acknowledges that virus can never be completely ruled out. The Participant is aware that unauthorised third parties may send emails under the name of Bytro Labs, without Bytro Lab’s knowledge or consent, and such emails may contain viruses, so-called spyware or links to websites which, in turn, contain viruses or spyware. Bytro Lab cannot prevent such behaviour. The Participant will, therefore, check all incoming mail sent by or under the name of Bytro Labs, for viruses before opening them. This also applies to emails sent by other Participants.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">13.7 Bytro Labs will usually, unless otherwise provided in these ToS or other agreements between the Participant and Bytro Labs, communicate with the Participant via email. The Participant shall make sure that he receives all emails sent by Bytro Labs to the address submitted to Bytro Labs in the registration form or at a later date. In particular, he will configure the spam filter accordingly and regularly check this address for incoming mail. Bytro Labs may choose any other appropriate means of communication. </span></p><p class="bodytext"><b><span lang="EN-GB">§ 14 Changes to these ToS</span></b><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">14.1 Bytro Labs reserves the right to make changes to these ToS for the future, if this should prove necessary and if the Participant is not disadvantaged contrary to good faith.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">14.2 The Participant will be notified of the changes to the ToS at least two weeks before the changes become effective, in appropriate written form. Notification will usually take place upon the next log-in of the Participant.</span></p><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">14.3 The Participant can object to a change or amendment of the ToS within one month of being notified thereof. If the Participant objects in time, each party may terminate the contract by giving one month’s notice. Further termination rights remain unaffected. Payment made for services after the termination takes effect will be reimbursed on a pro rata basis. If the Participant fails to object to the changes to the ToS within one month of being notified, the change or amendment made to the ToS will become effective regarding the respective Participant. </span></p><p class="bodytext"><b><span lang="EN-GB">§ 15 Place of Jurisdiction / Applicable Law / Written Form</span></b><p class="bodytext"></p></p><p class="bodytext"><span lang="EN-GB">15.1 The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany apply to these ToS and any and all contracts concluded subject to these ToS, as well as any claims arising therefrom.
