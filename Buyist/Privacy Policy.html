If you communicate with us regarding the Services we collect any information that you provide to us during the course of our communication.

We may contract with a third party to help us manage, monitor and optimize the Services and measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications and use of the Services.

We use your personal information primarily for our own internal purposes, such as providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the Services, to collect credit card payments for Fees and other purchases you make, and to provide customer support. We also use non-personal information, in aggregate form, for our own internal purposes, such as tracking use of the Services and assisting us in providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the Services.<br><br>4. <b>OUR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</b>.  We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.  We will disclose your personal information to protect or enforce our legal rights and policies, to protect or enforce the legal rights of a third party, or as we in good faith believe we are required to do so by law (such as to comply with a subpoena or court order, for example). We may contract with various third parties who help us provide, maintain and improve the Services and such third parties may have access to your personal information to perform their services. For example, we use a third party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out production, fulfillment, analytics, reporting or other operations.

We intend to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce such non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements if and when we become aware of any violations.<br><br>5. <b>OUR DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</b>.  We may disclose non-personal Information, in aggregate form, to potential strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others. You may not opt-out of the sharing of this information.<br><br>6. <b>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</b>. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. Most websites use cookies. We will use cookies to track your use of the Services, provide you with a more personalized user experience, and to facilitate your logging in to the Services. A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed on a web page or in an email that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting Services or receiving the email. Cookies and web beacons used by us will not be linked to your personal information.<br><br>7. <b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>. When in using the Services you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (sometimes referred to as “SSL”). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee absolute security. We are not responsible for the unauthorized acts of others and we assume no liability for any disclosure of information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access (such as through hacking) or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.<br><br>8. <b>REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>.

We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past transactions, logs of technical support calls, or other information may not be deleted. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.<br><br>9. <b>CHOICES ON COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</b>. We may, from time to time, send you email and other communications regarding Buyist products and services that we feel may interest you.

You may be able to access third party websites and services directly through the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you access third party websites and services.
