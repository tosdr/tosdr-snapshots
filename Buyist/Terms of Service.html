This license survives termination of the Terms of Service to the extent that Buyist requires the license to perform and exercise any obligations and rights that arose during the Term (as that term is defined below).<br><br>11. <b>USER ACCOUNT AND DATA</b>.<br><br>a. <b>User Account</b>. To access and use the Services, you must sign up for an account with Buyist (“<b>User Account</b>”).  Only the person who signs up for the User Account will be the contracting party for purposes of these Terms of Service, and will be authorized to use the User Account in connection with the Services (the “<b>Owner</b>”).  If the person who signs up for the User Account is doing so on behalf of that person’s employer, that person must have the authority to bind its employer to these Terms of Service, and the employer will be the Owner.  The Owner is permitted to allow others in its control to access and use the Services in connection with the Owner’s User Account, but in doing so acknowledges and agrees that it: (a) is responsible for ensuring that its employees and other agents comply with these Terms of Service; and (b) is liable for any breach of these Terms of Service by the Owner’s employees and other agents. <br><br>b. <b>User Account Sign Up</b>.

When you sign up for a User Account, you are required to provide Buyist with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself in all required fields of the Buyist registration form.  If your information changes, you agree to update your account to reflect these changes. If Buyist determines in its sole discretion that your account information is not complete, current, or accurate, or that your account violates the Terms of Service, Buyist may in its sole discretion suspend or terminate your account.   <br><br>c. <b>User Email Address</b>. In signing for a User Account, you will be required to provide an email address (“<b>User Email</b>”).  Buyist will use that User Email as the primary means of communicating with you.  You agree to monitor the User Email, and use the User Email to communicate with Buyist.<br><br>d. <b>Online Stores</b>. You may use the Services to create an online store to sell products and services to your customers (an “<b>Online Store</b>”).  Each Online Store can be associated with only one User Account, but each User Account may have more than one Online Stores.  <br><br>e. <b>User Data</b>. Buyist does not own any data, information, or material that you upload or otherwise transmit to the Services (“<b>User Data</b>”). You, not Buyist, are fully responsible for the quality, integrity, legality, accuracy, intellectual property ownership, reliability, appropriateness, or the right to use all of the User Data. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist will not be held responsible for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any User Data. Subject to the Buyist Privacy Policy, any User Data you upload or otherwise transmit to the Services or to Buyist, whether by email or other means, for any reason, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. While you retain all rights to the User Data, you grant Buyist a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual, and worldwide right to host, use, copy, distribute, expose, run, store, publicly perform, communicate to the public, broadcast, reproduce, make available, display, publish, translate, adapt, modify, create derivative works of, and otherwise use the User Data for any purpose whatsoever, regardless of the form or medium in which it is used.  Buyist may use our rights under this license to operate, provide, and promote the Services and to perform our obligations and exercise our rights under the Terms of Service. You represent, warrant, and agree that you have all necessary rights in the User Data to grant this license. You irrevocably waive any and all moral rights you may have in the User Data in favor of Buyist and agree that this waiver may be invoked by anyone who obtains rights in the User Data through Buyist, including anyone to whom Buyist may transfer or grant (including by way of license or sublicense) any rights in the User Data. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist can, at any time, review and delete any or all of the User Data submitted or uploaded to the Services, although Buyist is not obligated to do so.<br><br>12. <b>DMCA</b>. Buyist respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we ask you to do the same. If Buyist is notified of alleged infringing User Data through Buyist’s Designated Agent, a decision may be made to remove access or disable access to such User Data, in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) (“<b>DMCA</b>”).  Buyist may also make a good faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter-notification.<br><br>If you believe that your or someone else’s copyright has been infringed by User Data or other materials provided on the Services, you (or the owner or rights holder, collectively, “<b>Rights Holder</b>”) should send notification to Buyist’s Designated Agent immediately. Prior to sending us notice, the Rights Holder may wish to consult a lawyer to determine its rights and legal obligations under the DMCA and any other applicable laws. Nothing in the Terms of Service, the Site, or anywhere else in the Services is intended as a substitute for qualified legal advice. To file a notice of infringing material, Buyist asks that the Rights Holder provide the following information: (a) reasonably sufficient details about the nature of the copyrighted work in question, or, in the case of multiple alleged infringements, a representative list of such works (this should include, title(s), author(s), any U.S. Copyright Registration number(s), URL(s), etc.); (b) reasonably sufficient details to enable Buyist to identify and locate the material that is allegedly infringing the Rights Holders’ work(s) (for example, file name or URL of the page(s) that contain(s) the material); (c) the Rights Holder’s contact information so that Buyist can contact them (including for example, the Rights Holder’s address, telephone number, and email address); (d) a statement that the Rights Holder has a good faith belief that the use of the identified material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that the Rights Holder is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and (f) the Rights Holder’s electronic signature.<br><br><b>Notice may be sent to</b>:<br><br><i>By Mail</i>: <br>DMCA Notice&nbsp;<br>Buyist LLC<br>PO Box 616<br>North Reading, MA 01864<br><br><i>By e-mail</i>:<div><a href="mailto:support@buyist.com">support@buyist.com</a><br><div><br><b>Counter-Notification</b> If material that you have posted to the Services has been taken down, you may file a counter-notification that contains the following details: (a) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (b) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material in question; (c) your name, address and telephone number; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification in compliance with section 512 (c)(1)(C) of the DMCA, or an agent of such person; and (e) your physical or electronic signature.<br><br><b>Notice may be sent to</b>:<br><br><i>By Mail</i>: <br>DMCA Notice<br>Buyist LLC<br>PO Box 616<br>North Reading, MA 01864<br><br><i>By e-mail</i>:</div><div><a href="mailto:support@buyist.com">support@buyist.com</a> <br><br>You also acknowledge and agree that upon receipt of a notice of a claim of copyright infringement, Buyist may temporarily or permanently remove the identified materials from the Services without liability to you or any other party.<br><br>13. <b>PAYMENTS AND FEES</b>.<br><br>You will pay all fees applicable to your subscription for the Services (collectively, the “<b>Fees</b>”). Buyist calculates and bills Fees in advance on a monthly basis, unless you and Buyist agree otherwise in writing. You agree that you will pay all applicable Fees according to the billing process described below. Payment for Fees may be made via wire transfer, automated clearing house (“ACH”) transfer, check, credit card, or other payment method agreed to by you and Buyist in writing.  <br><br>a. <b>Fee Cycle and Payment of Fees</b>. You agree to allow Buyist to charge you on a monthly basis in advance for all Fees associated with providing the Services. You also agree to allow Buyist to charge you, as needed, for additional overage costs or other charges that you may accumulate in connection with your use of the Services. If you accumulate additional Fees or other charges in connection with the Services, Buyist will charge you in the payment period directly following the month in which the additional charges were accumulated.  All charges and Fees paid are non-refundable unless we specifically state otherwise in these Terms of Service, in a writing signed by you and Buyist, or as otherwise provided by applicable law. <br><br>b. <b>Payment by Credit Card</b>. If you choose to pay Fees by credit card, you agree: (a) to keep a valid credit card on file with Buyist to pay for incurred and reoccurring Fees (“<b>Authorized Credit Card</b>”); (b) Buyist will charge all applicable Fees to your Authorized Credit Card; and (c) Buyist will continue to charge the Authorized Credit Card for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated, and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full. <br><br>c. <b>Rejected Charges</b>. If Buyist is not able to process payment of Fees using an Authorized Credit Card or other means of payment provided by you (“<b>Rejected Charge</b>”), Buyist will notify you by email sent to the User Email (“<b>Email Notification</b>”).  If payment of the outstanding Fees associated with the Rejected Charge is not made: (a) within seven (7) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable all access to your User Account except the designated account admin; (b) within ten (10) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable all fulfillment exports associated with the User Account, and all orders in queue for the User Account can be exported only after the outstanding Fees associated with the Rejected Charge are paid; (c) within fourteen (14) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable your Online Store(s); (d) within twenty-one (21) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable your User Account; and (e) within thirty (30) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall permanently delete your User Account and all User Data.<br><br>d. <b>Billing Policies</b>. All Payments to Buyist are nonrefundable. Buyist does not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if you cancel your account in the middle of a billing cycle.
