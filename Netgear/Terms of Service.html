If You do not accept these Terms and Conditions, You must return the Product in good condition within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of original purchase for a refund. Refer to Section 7 for Subscription Cancellations. <br /> <br /> <strong>YOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 3</span>, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH NETGEAR.</strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY NETGEAR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, YOU FURTHER AGREE, AS DESCRIBED IN <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 6.4</span>, THAT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR SUBSCRIPTION MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME APPLICABLE TERM AND PRICE, UNTIL YOU CANCEL</span>.</strong></p> 
  <h5>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h5> 
  <p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These Terms and Conditions may be accepted by clicking the “I accept” button or checking a checkbox if such button or function is available or present via the user interface for the respective Product. You also accept the Terms and Conditions when You access or start to use the Product. <br /> <br /> 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By using the Product, You affirm that You are of legal age to enter into these Terms and Conditions. You may not use the Product if You are a: (a) person who is not of legal age or otherwise not entitled to form a binding contract with NETGEAR, or (b) person who is barred from receiving the Product under the laws of any country including the country in which You are a resident or from which You are using the Product. <br /> <br /> 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If You are an individual accessing or using the Product on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which You are associated (an “Organization”), then You are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of Yourself and such Organization, and You represent and warrant that You have the legal authority to bind such Organization to these Terms and Conditions. References to “You” and “Your” in these Terms and Conditions will refer to both the individual using the Services and to any such Organization.</p> 
  <h5>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5> 
  <p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NETGEAR would like an opportunity to address Your concerns without a formal legal case. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span> filing a claim against NETGEAR, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:legal@netgear.com" target="_blank">legal@netgear.com</a></strong> . NETGEAR will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting You in writing via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission to this email address, You or NETGEAR may bring a formal proceeding.</p> 
  <h5>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h5> 
  <p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You and NETGEAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to NETGEAR’s Terms and Conditions, Products, and relationship with You, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or efficacy of the NETGEAR Products. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. This agreement includes any claims against NETGEAR’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of NETGEAR. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts. <br /> <br /> 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To the extent possible under Your local law, the arbitration will take place in Santa Clara County, California. The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. NETGEAR’s Products and relationship with You involve interstate commerce, and this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1 <em>et seq.</em>). <br /> <br /> <strong>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND NETGEAR AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</strong> <br /> <br /> 3.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action. This arbitration agreement does not stop You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on Your behalf. If this specific provision, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” is found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. <br /> <br /> 3.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You agree that if NETGEAR makes any future, material change to this arbitration provision, You may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to <strong><a href="mailto:legal@netgear.com" target="_blank">legal@netgear.com</a></strong> . Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which You have already agreed, which would still remain in effect. <br /> <br /> 3.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to <a href="mailto:legal@netgear.com" target="_blank"><strong>legal@netgear.com</strong></a> within thirty (30) calendar days of purchasing Your NETGEAR Product. <br /> <br /> 3.7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p> 
  <h5>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h5> 
  <p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NETGEAR may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Each such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to You. NETGEAR may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by email, regular mail, text message, updating its website, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed. <br /> <br /> 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your continued use of the Product following any such notifications constitutes Your acceptance of such modifications and Your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, Your sole remedy is to discontinue Your use of the Product.

  <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subscriptions</span>. NETGEAR offers certain products and services on a subscription basis (“<strong>Subscription Services</strong>” or “<strong>Services</strong>”). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your subscription period is stated in Your subscription plan, and Your subscription fee will cover the Services and content covered in Your subscription plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of Your Subscription Services, NETGEAR may offer additional content for purchase (“<strong>Purchased</strong> <strong>Content</strong>”). Except as required by law, all transactions for Purchased Content are final, and NETGEAR does not accept returns. You may cancel an order for Purchased Content within 24 hours of purchase or rental (or, for customers in the European Union, within 14 days from the date of purchase), except You may not cancel an order for Purchased Content once You have downloaded it.</p> 
  <h5>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PAYMENT AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL</h5> 
  <p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment.</span> You agree that You will pay for the Subscription Services and other Purchased Content You purchase from NETGEAR, and that NETGEAR (or its third party payment processor) may charge Your credit card or other payment processing account (as chosen by You) for those Services and Purchased Content. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You further acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, subscription preferences that You select, changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and You authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING NETGEAR WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT PROCESSING ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. <br /> <br /> 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Billing Account and Payment Method</span>. You will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for a Service. You can access and change Your billing information and payment method by emailing <strong><a href="mailto:customer.service@netgear.com">customer.service@netgear.com</a>.</strong> Additionally, You agree to permit NETGEAR to use any updated account information regarding Your selected payment method provided by Your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. If You want to designate a different payment processing account or if there is a change in Your credit card other payment processing account status, You must change Your information online or by contacting customer support, which may temporarily disrupt Your access to the Services while NETGEAR verifies Your new payment information. <br /> <br /> 6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recurring Payments</span>. When You purchase the Subscription Services on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually), <strong>You agree that You are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to NETGEAR by the method and at the recurring intervals You have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by You or by NETGEAR</strong>. By authorizing recurring payments, You are authorizing NETGEAR to store Your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from Your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to Your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, “Electronic Payments”). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. <br /> <br /> 6.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Renewal and Trials</span> . If Your account is set to automatically renew or is in a trial period, YOU AGREE THAT NETGEAR MAY CHARGE YOU AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS YOU NOTIFY NETGEAR IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL. NETGEAR may revise subscription service rates by providing You at least thirty days’ notice prior to the next charge.</strong> <br /> <br /> 6.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Automatic Renewal Sign-Up.</strong></span> To sign up for Subscription Services with recurring payments, You must complete the required registration details, and agree that Your subscription may automatically renew for the same applicable term until You cancel: <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You will receive an e-mail confirmation of Your auto-renewal once You complete the initial payment process. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You agree that NETGEAR may automatically charge the subscription fee to the credit or charge card provided and associated with Your account at the beginning of each period at the frequency You have selected unless and until You cancel the subscription option. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You must cancel prior to the subscription fee being charged to the credit or charge card. If You signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period will be charged at the then effective subscription fee. Access to Your Services will not be established until NETGEAR or its agent has verified that the credit card information is valid, accurate and that Your credit card account is in good standing. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You will receive an e-mail reminder of Your auto-renewal thirty (30) days prior to any applicable renewal. You will also receive a reminder email a day before Your date of renewal reminding You that Your subscription option will be renewed for an additional period. <br /> <br /> 6.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Late Payments</span>. NETGEAR may suspend or terminate Your Services without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if Your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks the return of payments previously made to NETGEAR for the Subscription Services. You agree NETGEAR may charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for thirty (30) days or more. The monthly interest will equal up to one point five percent (1.5%) of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to NETGEAR. NETGEAR may refer Your account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> 6.7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hardware Equipment</span>. If Your Subscription Service includes hardware equipment, you will be charged a non-refundable shipping cost for NETGEAR to ship the equipment to you. <br /> <br /> 6.8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reactivation</span>. If for any reason You need to reactivate a terminated Subscription Service, You may be charged a reactivation fee</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NETGEAR or any supplier or partner of NETGEAR providing the Services to or together with NETGEAR are required by applicable law to terminate the provision of the Services or parts thereof (for example if due to changes in applicable law or due to court rulings or judgments the Services or parts thereof become or are considered unlawful); or <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Required by law. <br /> <br /> Upon any such termination of Your account by NETGEAR, You will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to Your use of the Subscription Services before the effective date of such termination, and NETGEAR will give You a pro-rated refund of any of Your paid for, but unused, Services fees that will remain unused because of NETGEAR’s termination. Termination of the Services may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with Your membership, including “<strong>Content</strong>” (i.e., all content that is made available in the Services or accessible as part of or by the use of the Services (including audio and sound files, data files, images, music, photographs, software, videos and written text)). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hardware Equipment</span>.

You may also be required to pay shipping charges associated with the return. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Content Back-Ups</span>. You are entirely responsible for backing up Your “<strong>User Content</strong>” (<em>i.e.,</em> any information, materials, documents, media files or other content You upload, transmit, create, post, display or otherwise provide on or through the Services) stored with NETGEAR or through the Services to another location outside the Services (e.g., by means of creating local copies or backups with specialized online backup Services) to avoid loss of Your User Content and other data. If NETGEAR disables access to Your Service, You may be prevented from accessing the Services, Your related account details or any files, User Content or products that are stored with the Services. NETGEAR may in its sole discretion, however, allow You to backup Your User Content stored with NETGEAR through the use of the Services. You understand that NETGEAR may delete Your User Content after a reasonable backup period has lapsed (“<strong>Backup Grace Period</strong>”). Different Backup Grace Periods may apply depending on the specific Service and the efforts required to backup the particular User Content.</p>

  <h5>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PRE-ORDERING NETGEAR PRODUCTS</h5> 
  <p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Ordering</span>. NETGEAR offers certain Products available for pre-order. By pre-ordering a NETGEAR Product, You acknowledge and agree that You are making a partial payment to a work-in-progress and are not making a direct purchase (“Contribution”). In return for Your Contribution, You will receive the number of Products You pre-ordered. If pre-order is available, the required Contribution for each Product will be listed on the Website. When You pre-order a Product, You agree to pay any amounts and fees NETGEAR may charge you for the Product. Before You are required to make any payment, You will have an opportunity to review and accept the amount that will be charged to You. All payments are in U.S. Dollars. NETGEAR will charge the payment method You specify at the time of your Contribution. You hereby authorize NETGEAR to charge all sums described herein to such payment method. NETGEAR may change the required Contribution amount for the Product by posting the changes on the Website. <br /> <br /> 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fulfillment</span>. You agree that NETGEAR may cancel or refund Your Contribution at any time and for any reason prior to the date on which NETGEAR or its affiliate ships the Product(s), and under such circumstances, NETGEAR is not required to fulfill the pre-order. <br /> <br /> 9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Refunds</span>. If You cancel your pre-order any time prior to the time NETGEAR or its affiliate ships Product(s), NETGEAR will refund to You the amount of Your Contribution.

NETGEAR’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If the Product(s) are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and You have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to NETGEAR, You will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and You will indemnify NETGEAR for any liability or expense it may incur in connection with such Sales Tax. Upon NETGEAR’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that You have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this sub-section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that NETGEAR is permitted to pass to its customers that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p> 
  <h5>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NETGEAR COMPATIBLE DEVICES</h5> 
  <p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of some of NETGEAR’s Products may require You to use a device that meets certain system and compatibility requirements. NETGEAR reserves the right to change these requirements. Whether a device is compatible also may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by third parties. Accordingly, devices that are compatible at one time may cease to be compatible in the future.</p>

SingleSignOn means that once You open an account with NETGEAR You may use Your User account and User ID for other Services of NETGEAR which eliminates the need to maintain separate User accounts and User ID’s for each individual Service. SingleSignOn may also allow You to sign in and sign off from Services and through different devices at once. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The SingleSignOn may offer You the possibility to connect Your Services with Your account from third party social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ with the SingleSignOn through an application programming interface (API) or other software. By allowing the SingleSignOn to connect with Your accounts on such third party sites, You consent to our accessing the information in those accounts, which information may include personally identifiable information. Additionally, You understand that by accessing the SingleSignOn via Your social media or other third party account, activity You engage in through the SingleSignOn may be published on the third party site. It is Your choice whether to use any such third party sites. We recommend You review the privacy policies of each third party site before You allow the SingleSignOn to connect with Your accounts on such third party sites or share pages or information with Your friends through those sites. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You agree that You do not own Your SingleSignOn username. NETGEAR may reclaim or use Your SingleSignOn username. <br /> <br /> 12.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection of Account Data.</span> <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Account Data, and for the activity that occurs under Your account.

NETGEAR may use this information to improve its Products or to provide additional services or technologies to You, but will not disclose Your Account Data to third parties for their independent marketing or promotional purposes unless You give consent. <br /> <br /> 12.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Connections.</span> Some Products may require the use of a broadband Internet connection or a mobile data connection. You are responsible for any Service charges for Your internet connection or data plan incurred as a result of using or accessing the Services.

Pay-per-incident services are NOT refundable. <br /> <br /> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NETGEAR Meural Canvas Extended Warranty extends and enhances the Limited Hardware Warranty for a Meural Canvas (“Canvas”). You must purchase the Extended Warranty within 90 (ninety) days from the date of Your purchase of a new Canvas. While a Canvas is under warranty, NETGEAR will repair or replace it with the same or functionally equivalent Canvas free of charge. You may contact NETGEAR support at 1-888-706-3872. <br /> <br /> <strong>Meural Canvas Extended Warranty does not include coverage due to accidental damage, defined here as physical damage, breakage, or failure caused by an accident or a result of an unexpected and unintentional event, for example, drops, spills, breakage, or damage that arise from Your normal daily usage of the Canvas.</strong></p>

If there is a problem charging your selected payment method, NETGEAR may charge any other valid payment method associated with your eStore Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your eStore Account and password and for restricting access to Your account, and You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under Your account or password. NETGEAR does not sell products for children. If You are under 18, You may not create an eStore Account and may only make purchases with a parent or guardian. NETGEAR reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion. NETGEAR’s collection, storage and use of Your eStore Account data will be in accordance with NETGEAR’s Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.NETGEAR.com/about/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://www.NETGEAR.com/about/privacy-policy/</a>. <br /> <br /> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paying for Your Order.</span> NETGEAR will charge Your payment method for an item at the time of shipment. However, NETGEAR may pre-authorize Your order amount with Your credit card, credit account, or debit card issuer at the time You place the order. When You pre-order with a debit card, NETGEAR will debit Your card when You place the pre-order. <br /> <br /> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Order Confirmation</span>. An order confirmation to You does not signify NETGEAR’s acceptance of Your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of NETGEAR’s offer to sell. At any time after receipt of Your order, NETGEAR may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on Your order for any reason. NETGEAR may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If NETGEAR cancels an order or part of an order that NETGEAR already charged You for, NETGEAR will refund You the full amount of the canceled portion of the order. <br /> <br /> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price Matching</span>. NETGEAR consistently works toward maintaining competitive prices on its Products and Services.

Non-warranty returns for new products are eligible for refund if You request a refund and return the item(s) to us within 30 days from Your original purchase date. Refurbished products purchased from netgear.com come with a 90-day return period and are eligible for refund if You request a refund and return the item(s) to us within 90 days from Your original purchase date. You will be refunded to Your original form of payment at the original purchase price plus applicable sales tax after we have processed your return at our returns facility. Return shipping charges (if any) will be deducted from Your refund. Refunds will appear on Your statement within approximately 15 business days. If You made Your purchase as part of a bundle or with a promotional offer, Your refund may be adjusted and/or pro-rated accordingly. NETGEAR does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at the returns facility. Instructions for warranty return and replacement are found here <a href="https://www.netgear.com/about/warranty/" target="_blank">https://www.netgear.com/about/warranty/</a>. <br /> <br /> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping, Delivery, Title, and Risk of Loss</span>. NETGEAR will pack and ship the Products in accordance with its standard practices.&nbsp; Shipping and handling charges are additional unless otherwise expressly indicated at the time of sale.&nbsp; Products are shipped by a third party carrier pursuant to a shipment contract.&nbsp; As a result, title to the Products and risk of loss will pass to You upon NETGEAR’s delivery of the Products to the carrier. You acknowledge that all scheduled shipment dates are estimates only. NETGEAR will make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment dates, but in no event will NETGEAR be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery. <br /> <br /> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes</span>. NETGEAR is required by law to charge applicable sales taxes based on state and local laws. Generally, the tax rate is based on the type of product or service purchased and where Your purchase is shipped, delivered, or picked up.&nbsp; Where sales tax applies, the order total during Your checkout reflects the estimated tax.

NETGEAR will make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the Products and Services it sells. NETGEAR does not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, or error free. Prices and promotions are subject to change. NETGEAR cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until You place Your order. Despite NETGEAR’s best efforts, sometimes an item may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, NETGEAR may cancel Your order or contact You for instructions on the order. NETGEAR also reserves the right to limit quantities and to revise, suspend, or terminate an event or promotion at any time without notice. <br /> <br /> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unavailability of Account; Termination; Fraud</span>. NETGEAR may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend Your use or access to Your account for any reason, including without limitation, breach of these Terms and Conditions.
