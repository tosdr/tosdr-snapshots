Students will then be able to visit with each College and their Users at the Event, and if the Student is interested in or wants to learn more about a particular college, the User, using the StriveScan App, can scan the barcode.Â  All of the information input into the Student Registration Form will then be available to the College via the Service.</li>
<li><strong>Student Information and Registration.</strong> As a Student, when you first arrive at an Event, you will be instructed to complete a registration form (the âStudent Registration Formâ) for the Service via a website. The registration form contains various questions regarding your background information, academic performance, and interests (collectively, âStudent Informationâ). Upon submission of the Student Registration Form, each Student will receive a unique barcode. Â This barcode will be used by the organizers and hosts of the Event, Colleges and their Users (as defined below) to collect the Student Information. You understand that once you provide your Student Information to a particular Event organizer/host or College, they are solely responsible for how they use or exploits that Student Information. Though StriveScan encourages Event organizers and Colleges to use responsible practices when gathering Student Information, StriveScan is not responsible nor may be held liable for any actions or omissions of such Event organizers or Colleges.</li>

<li><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong>
<ol>
<li>Choice of Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States of America and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any other law.</li>
<li>Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief), arising out of the Terms or the Service, where the total amount of the award sought is less than $5,000, the Party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) provider mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The ADR provider and the Parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the Party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the Parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. StriveScan shall reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $5,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to arbitration, except those claims that may be asserted in small claims court. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and governed under AAAâs rules. ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR STRIVESCAN MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTYâS CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, StriveScan will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation. StriveScan reserves the right, in its sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law. Judgment on an arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be confidential and final and binding upon the Parties without appeal or review, except as permitted by Illinois law or United States federal law.The Parties agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in a court of competent jurisdiction located in Cook County, Illinois, and the Parties waive any right to a jury trial. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the above, either Party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Subject to the arbitration provisions set forth herein, the successful Party in any dispute will be entitled to receive from the unsuccessful Party all reasonable attorneysâ fees, costs, and disbursements.</li>
<li>Severability. If any provision â or portion of a provision â of this Agreement is held invalid, unenforceable, or void, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
<li>Separability. This Agreement does not and shall not be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties hereto.</li>
<li>Merger. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties hereto, and replaces any and all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements between the parties, whether oral, electronic, or written, pertaining to the managerial relationship outlined herein.Â  The parties acknowledge that they have not relied on any promise, representation, or warranty, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement.Â  No waiver or any breach of this Agreement shall be construed as a continuing waiver or consent to any subsequent breach hereof.</li>
