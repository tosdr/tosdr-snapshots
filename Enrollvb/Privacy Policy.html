protections against the misuse, loss, or unlawful disclosure of social security
numbers.

            <h4>Only After Authorization is Received</h4>

            <p>
                You may give us written
authorization to use your PHI or disclose it to anyone for any purpose not
otherwise permitted or required by law. If you give us an authorization, you
may revoke it in writing at any time. Your revocation will not affect any use
or disclosure permitted by your authorization while it was in effect.

                While the law permits us in certain
circumstances to disclose your PHI to family, friends and others, we will do so
only with your authorization. In the event you are unable to authorize such
disclosure, but emergency or similar circumstances indicate that disclosure
would be in your best interest, we may disclose your PHI to family, friends or
others to the extent necessary to help with your health care coverage
arrangements.

Act Privacy Notice</h2>
            <p>
                The GLBA Privacy Notice is
provided to help you better understand how we obtain, use, share, and protect
your non-public Personal Financial Information. 
We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your Personal
Financial Information. For the purposes of this notice, &quot;Personal
Financial Information&quot; means information, other than health information,
about an enrollee or an applicant for health care coverage that identifies the
individual, is not generally publicly available, and is collected from the
individual associated with providing health care coverage to the individual.
            </p>
            <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

            We collect Personal Financial
Information about you and your family when you complete enrollment applications
and forms. We also collect information from your dealings with us, our
affiliates, or others.  For example, we
may receive information about you from participants in the healthcare system,
such as your doctor or hospital, as well as from employers or plan
administrators, credit bureaus, and the Medical Information Bureau.

        The information we receive may
include such items as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth,
Social Security number, premium payment history, and your activity on our
Website.  This also includes information
regarding your medical benefit plan, your health benefits, and health risk
assessments.

        <h3>Disclosure of your Information</h3>

            We do not disclose Personal Financial Information about our enrollees or former enrollees to any third party, except as required or permitted by law.

        In the course of our general
business practices, we may disclose Personal Financial Information about you or
others without your permission to our corporate affiliates to provide them with
information about your transactions, such as your premium payment history.

        <h3>Information Security</h3>

            EnrollVB restricts access to Personal
Financial Information about you to our employees and service providers who are
involved in administering your employee benefits and providing related
services.  Among the safeguards that have
been developed to protect your Personal Financial Information are
administrative, physical, and technical controls that together enhance the
security of the information. We conduct periodic assessments of these safeguards
to ensure appropriate and secure handling of your Personal Financial
Information.

        <h3>Accessing and Modifying Personal Financial Information</h3>

            Based on your state of residence,
you may have a right to request access to the Personal Financial Information
that we maintain. Your right includes the right to know the source of the
information and the identity of the persons, institutions, or types of
institutions to whom we have disclosed such information.  Your right includes the ability to view such
information and copy it in person or request that a copy of it be sent to you
by mail.  We may charge you a reasonable
fee to cover our costs associated with this request. Your right also includes
the right to request corrections, amendments, or deletions of any information in
our possession. The procedures that you must follow to request access to or
