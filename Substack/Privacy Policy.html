This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and share your personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") through our website (<a href="http://www.substack.com/">www.substack.com</a>) and our services. Please read it carefully.</p><p>Remember that your use of Substack is at all times subject to the<a href="https://substack.com/tos"> Terms of Use</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the<a href="https://substack.com/tos"> Terms of Use</a>.</p><p><strong>This Privacy Policy includes additional notices that may apply to you if you are a California consumer.</strong> Please see the section further below titled "Additional Notices for California Residents" for more details.</p><p><strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy details how we collect, receive, use, store, share, transfer and process your Personal Information. It also describes the choices you have regarding the use of your Personal Information, as well as your rights and how you execute these rights.</p><p>This Privacy Policy only applies to the processing of your Personal Information by Substack as a data controller, meaning where we process your Personal Information for our purposes. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any processing of your Personal Information by Substack as a data processor on behalf of a Publisher. Publishers will have their own privacy practices governing their use of Personal Information as outlined in their own terms of use and/or privacy policies.</p><p><strong>Will Substack ever change this Privacy Policy?</strong></p><p>We’re constantly trying to improve our services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on our site, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p><p>Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of Substack, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.</p><p><strong>What Information does Substack collect?</strong></p><p>We collect and process Personal Information about you when you interact with us and our services, as well as when you subscribe to any of our paid or unpaid services. This may include:</p><ul><li><p>your first and last name;</p></li><li><p>your email address;</p></li><li><p>your phone number;</p></li><li><p>your payment details (including billing address, credit card details, where you make a purchase from us);</p></li><li><p>your location and/or mailing address;</p></li><li><p>your photograph;</p></li><li><p>your marketing preferences, including any consents you have given us;</p></li><li><p>information related to the browser or device you use to access our website (including your IP address);</p></li><li><p>any information we collect online from you and maintain in association with your account, such as your username and password;</p></li><li><p>your subscription status with Substack newsletters;</p></li><li><p>public information about the social media accounts you associate with your Substack account;</p></li><li><p>your direct message contents and metadata;</p></li><li><p>any other information you provide us when communicating with us.</p></li></ul><p>We may also collect information about you when one of our users syncs their address book information with our app for contact syncing purposes. This information collection is strictly limited to email addresses and phone numbers, and any information collected in this manner is securely stored only as hashed values.</p><p>Finally, we also collect information on the use of our website via Cookies. Please view the section “Cookies” below for more information.</p><p><strong>How does Substack use your Personal Information?</strong></p><p>We process this Personal Information for the following purposes:</p><ul><li><p>To establish and fulfill a contract with you, for example when you subscribe to a subscription Service. This may include verifying your identity, taking payments, communicating with you, providing customer service;</p></li><li><p>As required by Substack to enable our business and pursue our legitimate interests. In particular we use your Personal Information for the following purposes:</p><ul><li><p>to provide services you have requested, and respond to any communications, comments or complaints you send us;</p></li><li><p>to monitor the use of our services and to help us monitor, improve and protect our services, content and website;</p></li><li><p>allow you to create, maintain, customize and secure your account with us;</p></li><li><p>to personalize our services for you and provide recommendations;</p></li><li><p>to monitor any user accounts to prevent, investigate and/or report fraud, misrepresentation, terrorism, security incidents or crime in accordance with applicable law;</p></li><li><p>to invite you to take part in surveys or market research;</p></li><li><p>to facilitate contact syncing between users who opt in to our app’s contact syncing functionality;</p></li><li><p>Where our use of Personal Information is made pursuant to a balancing of our legitimate interests with your privacy interest, we will provide more information about our balancing analysis and process on request. Please send any such requests to privacy@substackinc.com.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Compliance with applicable laws and protection of Substack’s legitimate business interests and legal rights, including but not limited to use in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, investigative purposes (including disclosure of such information in connection with legal process or litigation).</p></li><li><p>In addition, we will send you, based on your consent (if required), direct marketing communication in relation to our relevant services, or other services provided by us, our affiliates and carefully selected partners. You can withdraw your consent at any time ("opt out"); see the section "What are your rights?" below. In case of electronic direct marketing you can opt out by following the instructions in the communication.</p></li><li><p>In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></li></ul><p><strong>How will Substack share the Personal Information it receives?</strong></p><p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Affiliates:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Information to our subsidiaries and/or corporate affiliates for the purposes as described above.</p></li><li><p><strong>Publishers:</strong> when you subscribe to a Publisher’s newsletter, we provide them the information necessary (including your name and email address) to provide you their newsletter(s). Please note that Publishers control their own newsletters; accordingly, when you interact with a Publisher’s newsletter in a way that requires your personal information, including when commenting on a newsletter that you have not subscribed to, that personal information is provided directly to the Publisher.</p></li><li><p><strong>Our Service Providers:</strong> We share your Personal Information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf; for example, we use Stripe (a third party payment provider) to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Such third parties further include, but are not limited to, providers of: website hosting; maintenance services; email services; security services; content delivery networks; customer support operations and software services; traffic and usage analytics services; and cloud storage and computing services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other users:</strong> If your user profile allows it, you may choose to populate certain user profile information, including, without limitation, your name, subscriptions, publications, location, and any image content. Any user profile information uploaded may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the services (including when you post comments or upload images or videos through the services). Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Your username and user profile may also be displayed to other users when you interact with a newsletter post, for instance, by “liking” the post or leaving a comment. You may have the option to allow Substack to share information on what you’ve read or are reading on Substack with the public, or with other accounts socially connected to your own, such as your social media followers. If you opt into contact syncing through our app, your profile information will be shared with any user who has (i) also opted into contact syncing, and who (ii) identified you as a contact.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prospective sellers or buyers:</strong> We may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the sale or merger of our business or assets (subject to local laws). Also, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government authorities, law enforcement officials, and court-ordered disclosures:</strong> If required for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws we may share Personal Information with competent regulatory, prosecuting, tax or governmental authorities, courts or other tribunals, or with litigants entitled by law to receive personal information, in any jurisdiction or markets, domestic or foreign.</p></li></ul><p>In certain cases, we may anonymize your Personal Information in such a way that you can no longer be identified as an individual, and we reserve the right to use and share such anonymized information to trusted partners not specified here. However, we never disclose aggregated or de-identified information in a manner that could identify you as an individual.</p><p><strong>Where will we send your Personal Information?</strong></p><p>Substack is established in the US and uses service providers established both in the US and in other countries to process Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. As such, your Personal Information may be shared internationally.</p><p><strong>Is Personal Information about you secure?</strong></p><p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p><p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, failure of the services, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p><p><strong>Privacy and your direct messages</strong></p><p>You can use Substack to send direct messages to other Substack users, and to receive direct messages from other Substack users. <strong>Please note that, at this time, direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted, and are not a substitute for secure messaging services.</strong> Direct messaging contents are disclosed to their intended recipients. Recipients of direct messages may keep those messages even if you request their deletion, and even if you delete your Substack account. Keep in mind that recipients of your direct messages do not necessarily have any obligation to keep them private.</p><p>We will only disclose direct message contents to people other than the intended recipients in very limited circumstances where allowed or required by law, for example, in response to valid court orders or in emergency situations involving danger of death or serious physical injury. While we maintain strict internal access controls on direct messaging content, keep in mind that Substack personnel may access the contents of direct messages to enforce our Terms of Use, ensure the security of our platform, to provide user support, or as otherwise necessary to provide our services. We may also use automated means to ensure the safety of direct messaging content, including scanning for spam, malicious content, and child abuse material.</p><p><strong>Privacy and SMS Services</strong></p><p>If you provide us with your phone number, we may use a third-party service provider to verify your phone number with an SMS text message. Information regarding this SMS verification is used only for verification purposes, and is not shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes.</p><p><strong>What are your rights?</strong></p><p>Depending on applicable local laws, you may be entitled to ask Substack for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. You may also have rights to object to some processing activities or to request restriction of some processing activities. Where we have asked for your consent to process your Personal Information, you may also have the right to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations or in accordance with applicable law – for example, we cannot delete your Personal Information when we can demonstrate that we have a legal obligation to retain it. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent or you delete your account.</p><p>Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such information is mandatory: if such information is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional. Please note we will always inform you where the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or optional.</p><p>We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information.

Please note that Publishers control their own newsletters; accordingly, when you interact with a Publisher\u2019s newsletter in a way that requires your personal information, including when commenting on a newsletter that you have not subscribed to, that personal information is provided directly to the Publisher.</p></li><li><p><strong>Our Service Providers:</strong> We share your Personal Information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf; for example, we use Stripe (a third party payment provider) to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Such third parties further include, but are not limited to, providers of: website hosting; maintenance services; email services; security services; content delivery networks; customer support operations and software services; traffic and usage analytics services; and cloud storage and computing services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other users:</strong> If your user profile allows it, you may choose to populate certain user profile information, including, without limitation, your name, subscriptions, publications, location, and any image content. Any user profile information uploaded may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the services (including when you post comments or upload images or videos through the services). Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Your username and user profile may also be displayed to other users when you interact with a newsletter post, for instance, by \u201Cliking\u201D the post or leaving a comment. You may have the option to allow Substack to share information on what you\u2019ve read or are reading on Substack with the public, or with other accounts socially connected to your own, such as your social media followers. If you opt into contact syncing through our app, your profile information will be shared with any user who has (i) also opted into contact syncing, and who (ii) identified you as a contact.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prospective sellers or buyers:</strong> We may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the sale or merger of our business or assets (subject to local laws). Also, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government authorities, law enforcement officials, and court-ordered disclosures:</strong> If required for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws we may share Personal Information with competent regulatory, prosecuting, tax or governmental authorities, courts or other tribunals, or with litigants entitled by law to receive personal information, in any jurisdiction or markets, domestic or foreign.</p></li></ul><p>In certain cases, we may anonymize your Personal Information in such a way that you can no longer be identified as an individual, and we reserve the right to use and share such anonymized information to trusted partners not specified here. However, we never disclose aggregated or de-identified information in a manner that could identify you as an individual.</p><p><strong>Where will we send your Personal Information?</strong></p><p>Substack is established in the US and uses service providers established both in the US and in other countries to process Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. As such, your Personal Information may be shared internationally.</p><p><strong>Is Personal Information about you secure?</strong></p><p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p><p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, failure of the services, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p><p><strong>Privacy and your direct messages</strong></p><p>You can use Substack to send direct messages to other Substack users, and to receive direct messages from other Substack users. <strong>Please note that, at this time, direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted, and are not a substitute for secure messaging services.</strong> Direct messaging contents are disclosed to their intended recipients. Recipients of direct messages may keep those messages even if you request their deletion, and even if you delete your Substack account. Keep in mind that recipients of your direct messages do not necessarily have any obligation to keep them private.</p><p>We will only disclose direct message contents to people other than the intended recipients in very limited circumstances where allowed or required by law, for example, in response to valid court orders or in emergency situations involving danger of death or serious physical injury. While we maintain strict internal access controls on direct messaging content, keep in mind that Substack personnel may access the contents of direct messages to enforce our Terms of Use, ensure the security of our platform, to provide user support, or as otherwise necessary to provide our services. We may also use automated means to ensure the safety of direct messaging content, including scanning for spam, malicious content, and child abuse material.</p><p><strong>Privacy and SMS Services</strong></p><p>If you provide us with your phone number, we may use a third-party service provider to verify your phone number with an SMS text message. Information regarding this SMS verification is used only for verification purposes, and is not shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes.</p><p><strong>What are your rights?</strong></p><p>Depending on applicable local laws, you may be entitled to ask Substack for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. You may also have rights to object to some processing activities or to request restriction of some processing activities. Where we have asked for your consent to process your Personal Information, you may also have the right to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations or in accordance with applicable law \u2013 for example, we cannot delete your Personal Information when we can demonstrate that we have a legal obligation to retain it. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent or you delete your account.</p><p>Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such information is mandatory: if such information is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional. Please note we will always inform you where the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or optional.</p><p>We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information. If you have any concerns about how we process your Personal Information, or would like to opt out of marketing, you can get in touch at privacy@substackinc.com.</p><p>If you are a California consumer, please see the section further below titled \u201CAdditional Notices for California Residents\u201D for more notices regarding your Personal Information.</p><p><em>You can access, edit, or delete some personal information by yourself</em></p><p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you\u2019ve provided to us:</p><ul><li><p>name and password</p></li><li><p>email address</p></li><li><p>user profile information, including images you may have uploaded to the site</p></li></ul><p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the services change.

We will notify Publishers as soon as reasonably practicable if Publishers\u2019 access to Substack is suspended or substantially limited due to technical problems with the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You agree that this means that newsletters (or any content therein) may be removed from Substack at any time in our discretion.

The Publisher:</p><ul><li><p>acknowledges that Substack, Substack affiliates and their respective third party service providers may process personal data in connection with the provision of Substack products and services to the Publisher (the \u201CServices\u201D).

This policy is designed to comply with the requirements of the notice-and-takedown provisions of the United States\u2019 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201CDMCA\u201D), meaning that we generally remove or disable content that rightsholders claim to be infringing. Undefined terms used here have the meanings given to them in our <a href=\\\"http://substack.com/tos\\\">Terms of Use</a>.</p><p><strong>Caution Advised</strong></p><p>The notices described in this policy are serious legal actions with potentially serious consequences. Note in particular:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Filing a false copyright notice can be unlawful</strong>. Aside from perjury penalties, sending false copyright notices can create legal claims under the DMCA.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispute copyright notices with care.</strong> Copyright owners can prevent disabled content from being put back by initiating legal action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Information submitted in notices is not private</strong>. Your copyright notice will be sent to the other party. We reserve the right to publicly post and share redacted copyright notices for transparency reporting purposes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Copyright disputes are tracked for purposes of our <a href=\\\"https://substack.com/repeat_infringer\\\">Repeat Infringer Policy</a>. </strong>Our policies and the DMCA both commit us to taking action against repeat infringers, and we will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in certain cases. How you respond to copyright notices informs our repeat infringer evaluation.</p></li></ul><p>Consider seeking professional advice before proceeding with any notice described in this policy.</p><p><strong>Submitting Notices and Our Designated Agent</strong></p><p>This policy provides links to our preferred forms for submitting copyright notices. Although we respond to all copyright notices submitted under this policy expeditiously, submitting your notice through our forms will help ensure that your notice is compliant with legal requirements and receives the fastest possible response.</p><p>If you prefer to submit a non-form notice to our designated agent, you can do so by emailing <a href=\\\"mailto:copyright@substackinc.com\\\">copyright@substackinc.com</a>. Our designated agent can also be reached by mail at Substack DMCA Processing, 111 Sutter Street, Floor 7, San Francisco, CA 94104.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sending a Copyright Notice</strong></p><p>If you believe that something on Substack infringes a copyright that belongs to you, you can send us a copyright notice by <a href=\\\"https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001921412&amp;tf_18071015993108=report_a_copyright_violation\\\">completing this form</a>. On receipt of a notice compliant with the requirements of the DMCA, our practice is to expeditiously remove or disable the material identified as infringing. Note that copyright notices can be disputed under the terms of this policy, and that the dispute process may result in replacement of removed or disabled content.</p><p>When sending a non-form notice to our designated agent, be sure that it includes all the information required under the DMCA.

After receiving a dispute notice that meets the requirements of the DMCA, we will send a complete copy of the notice to the complaining party. The rightsholder will then have 10 business days to initiate legal action and notify us. If we don\u2019t receive timely notice of legal action from the rightsholder, we will generally replace the material that had been removed or disabled.</p><p>When sending a non-form notice to our designated agent, be sure that it includes all the information required under the DMCA.

We host and celebrate a diverse range of thought and discussion. The following guidelines outline what is and is not acceptable on Substack. We have the exclusive right to interpret and enforce&nbsp;these guidelines, although we may consult outside experts, research, and industry best practices in doing so. If you encounter content that may be in breach of these guidelines or have any questions about them, you can email us at <a href=\\\"mailto:tos@substackinc.com\\\">tos@substackinc.com</a>. </p><p>If we determine that any content is in breach of these guidelines, we may remove it, hide it from public view, or impose other restrictions. This is an evolving document: we reserve the right to update these Content Guidelines at our discretion and without notice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legal&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please respect people\u2019s intellectual property and don\u2019t infringe on their privacy or any other legal rights. Don\u2019t publish anything that violates laws or regulations.&nbsp;You and you alone are responsible for the content you publish on Substack, and liable for any harm caused by the content you publish.</p><p><strong>In General&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We want Substack to be a safe place for discussion and expression. At the same time, we believe that critique and discussion of controversial issues are part of robust discourse, so we work to find a reasonable balance between these two priorities. In all cases, Substack does not allow credible threats of physical harm.</p><p><strong>Hate&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Substack cannot be used to publish content or fund initiatives that incite violence based on protected classes. Offending behavior includes credible threats of physical harm to people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability or medical condition.</p><p><strong>Private information&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You may not publish or post other people's private information (such as a personal phone number or home address) without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so. The publication of publicly accessible information is not a violation of this policy. </p><p><strong>Plagiarism</strong></p><p>Do not publish any material that was written or created by someone else and claim it as your own.</p><p><strong>Impersonation</strong></p><p>We don\u2019t allow impersonation, which includes posing as another person, brand, or organization. This applies to Substack itself: don\u2019t use Substack\u2019s name, logo, or trademark in any way that misrepresents the company or misleads others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>People restricted from making money on Substack</strong></p><p>Substack\u2019s payments are processed through Stripe, which excludes certain types of businesses from using their service. Please refer to the Stripe Service Agreement (<em><a href=\\\"https://stripe.com/legal\\\">see the US agreement here</a></em>) and Stripe\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses\\\">restricted businesses</a> for more information about restricted business categories and practices.</p><p><strong>Harmful and illegal activities</strong></p><p>We don\u2019t allow content that promotes harmful or illegal activities, including material that advocates, threatens, or shows you causing harm to yourself, other people, or animals.</p><p><strong>Spam and phishing</strong></p><p>We are vehemently anti-spam and anti-phishing. If you are importing a mailing list from another platform, you are required to ensure it\u2019s made up of people who explicitly opted-in to receive emails from your specific publication. We don\u2019t allow imports of email addresses that were purchased, scraped, or harvested from third party websites. Don\u2019t add people to your mailing list without their consent, and don\u2019t import your contacts list or social graphs. Similarly, you may not create publications for spamming or phishing purposes. Don\u2019t post spam when interacting with others on Substack, such as in comments, discussion threads, or email replies. </p><p><strong>Marketing and Promotion</strong></p><p>Substack is intended for high quality editorial content, not conventional email marketing. We don\u2019t permit publications whose primary purpose is to advertise external products or services, drive traffic to third party sites, distribute offers and promotions, enhance search engine optimization, or similar activities. Brands and commercial organizations publishing on Substack may be subject to additional verification. </p><p><strong>Nudity, porn, erotica</strong></p><p>We don\u2019t allow porn or sexually exploitative content on Substack, including any visual depictions of sexual acts for the sole purpose of sexual gratification. We do allow depictions of nudity for artistic, journalistic, or related purposes, as well as erotic literature, however, we have a strict no nudity policy for profile images. We may hide or remove explicit content from Substack\u2019s discovery features, including search and on <a href=\\\"http://substack.com/\\\">Substack.com</a>. </p><p><strong>Comments, Notes &amp; Community Surfaces</strong></p><p>These guidelines also apply to Substack comments, notes, and other community surfaces. We believe that writers are responsible for moderating their own communities as they see fit and readers for curating their own experiences on the platform. Don\u2019t create accounts for the sole purpose of circumventing boundaries like blocks and bans imposed by other users. We may intervene to remove accounts engaged in artificial or inauthentic activity on community surfaces.</p>\",\"repeat_infringer\":\"<p><strong>Documents</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/tos\\\">Terms of Use</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/privacy\\\">Privacy Policy</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/pa\\\">Publisher Agreement</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/content\\\">Content Guidelines</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/dispute\\\">Copyright Dispute Policy</a></p></li><li><p>Copyright Repeat Infringer Policy</p></li><li><p><a href=\\\"https://substack.com/ccpa\\\">CCPA Policy</a></p></li></ul><h1><strong>Repeat Infringer Policy</strong></h1><p>Last updated: August 18th, 2020</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Substack has an interest in maintaining the quality, originality, and legality of the content we host. To best serve our creative community and to meet our own legal obligations to copyright holders, we have adopted the following policy toward repeat copyright infringers on our platform.</p><p><strong>Our commitment to individualized consideration</strong></p><p>Copyright claims are complex, and can often be used to silence or censor the kind of reporting and commentary we hope to support. Accordingly, we are committed to handling repeat infringers on a case-by-case basis as long as our total caseload allows. Our aim is to take remedial action seriously, not mechanically.</p><p><strong>Context is important</strong></p><p>A corollary to our commitment above, we strive to consider the greater context of copyright claims in deciding on remedial action. This includes asking:</p><ul><li><p>What is the nature of the alleged infringement? Is it plagiarism (which is also against our content guidelines)? Is it a plausible fair use?</p></li><li><p>Does the complained-about content have free speech significance? Political significance?</p></li><li><p>Who are the complainers? Are they credible?</p></li><li><p>Does the alleged infringer have a known history of infringement off our platform?</p></li></ul><p><strong>When we will consider repeat infringer claims</strong></p><p>We will consider whether remedial action is appropriate when:</p><ul><li><p>A request for remedial action against an alleged repeat infringer is brought to our attention through a credible third-party complaint sent to an appropriate channel (e.g., our agent for service of process or our DMCA designated agent)</p></li><li><p>We receive more than three compliant DMCA notices about different pieces of content from the same user in the same calendar year</p></li><li><p>A series of alleged infringements appears particularly willful or egregious</p></li></ul><p><strong>Remedial Action</strong></p><p>We will consider any appropriate remedial action currently available in our content moderation workflow, potentially including:</p><ul><li><p>Written warnings</p></li><li><p>Demonetizing newsletters</p></li><li><p>Delisting newsletters</p></li><li><p>Account termination</p></li></ul>\",\"reader_eula\":\"<h1>Substack Reader End-User License Agreement</h1><p>Substack, Inc.&nbsp;provides our Substack Reader app (the \u201CApp\u201D) to you under the terms of this End-User License Agreement (the \u201CEULA\u201D).
