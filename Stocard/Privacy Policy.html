<h2 id="2-what-sources-and-data-do-we-use">2. What sources and data do we use?</h2>
<p>In connection with the installation and usage of the app, we collect, process and use the data described below to find out which companies, products or other topics you are interested in and which information and offers from our partner companies are relevant for you to be able to use the functions of our app on this basis as needed and to provide you with the most relevant information and offers from our partner companies in the app.</p>
<p>If you use the app, we collect, process and use the following data for the previously listed purposes to fulfill our contractual obligations in terms of art. 6 para. 1 b GDPR or based on entitled interest in terms of art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR (this means interest in the analysis, optimization and efficient operation of our app):</p>
<ul>
<li>a) <strong>Card data</strong>: To be able to use the functions of the app, you have to provide your loyalty card and customer number from a card provider. This card data is converted for the contractually agreed upon purposes, this means into the respective barcode, and then used within the scope of the app as well as to protect against abuse and - if additionally agreed upon - the provision of other services.</li>
<li>b) <strong>Usage data</strong>: If you use the app, we collect and save how you use the card (for example, card used, time, number of points). </li>
<li>c) <strong>Location data</strong>: If you allow the app to access the location function on your mobile device, Stocard is entitled to use the corresponding location data (so-called location-based data) to design the app as needed, to deliver location-related information and for advertising. Stocard only accesses this data in an anonymous form. There is no further usage or sharing of this location-based data from the respective user. For the location-based data, the Stocard app uses the GPS module from the mobile device, the IP address or cellular network data (cell ID) from the respective user.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use the previously listed data in an anonymized form for market research and to create anonymized statistics.</p>
<p>If you consent to the respective data processing within the scope of the app, we can process and use your data for the respectively specified purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>d) <strong>Registration data</strong>: When applying for a new loyalty card, usually your name and your email address and any other mandatory information are needed (basic data). This basic data and further voluntarily disclosed data (for example, telephone number) is collected, saved and used by Stocard within the scope of the registration of the respective loyalty card. The basic data, any voluntary information and, if necessary, their changes (application data) will be sent to the partner company by Stocard for the further processing and issuing of the respective customer card where you apply for the respective customer card. If you have agreed to have your application data forwarded to a partner company, this consent also applies to other customer cards that you apply for through the app. Any transfer of personal data to third parties going beyond this only occurs - except in the case of a concrete suspicion of abuse - if and provided that you have given Stocard separate consent to this transmission. Furthermore, the customer card conditions from the respective partner apply, which are linked correspondingly and you have given separate consent. </li>
<li>e) <strong>Interface data</strong>: if you have logged into your user account from a card provider through the app, we will collect and save the respective point status and the shared transactions or other offers provided to you (such as card-linked coupons or personalized offers). The respective login data is saved to ensure easy access to this interface or other interfaces in the future where you can also use this login data.</li>
<li>f) <strong>Personalized offers</strong>: If you consent to the delivery of personalized offers from our partner companies (for example, rebate coupons), we can share your card number with general information about your usage of the app with the respective card provider so that we can send you personalized offers (including card-linked coupons) through the app or through other electronic channels (for example, by email or messenger).</li>
<li>g) <strong>Data privacy statement for receiving PAYBACK points balance and transactions</strong>: You can enter the password for your PAYBACK account in the Stocard app in order to display your PAYBACK points and your PAYBACK transactions. After entering your credentials, we will collect and securely transmit your password to PAYBACK, in order to request your data from PAYBACK and display it in Stocard.

<h3 id="a-to-fulfill-contractual-obligations-art-6-para-1-b-gdpr">a) To fulfill contractual obligations (art. 6 para. 1 b. GDPR)</h3>
<p>The processing of data occurs primarily to be able to provide the services and functions from our app.</p>
<h3 id="b-within-the-scope-of-the-consideration-of-interests-art-6-para-1-f-gdpr">b) Within the scope of the consideration of interests (art. 6 para. 1 f. GDPR)</h3>
<p>If necessary, we will process your data beyond the actual fulfillment of the contract to preserve entitled interests from us or third parties, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li>to design the app as needed, </li>
<li>to examine and optimize the procedure for the analysis of requirements for the purpose of direct customer contact,</li>
<li>for advertising or market and opinion research, provided that you have not objected to the usage of your data,</li>
<li>to preserve IT security,</li>
<li>to control and develop our app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-based-on-your-consent-art-6-para-1-a-gdpr">c) Based on your consent (art. 6 para. 1 a GDPR)</h3>
<p>If you have given us express consent (opt-in) to process personal data for the respective purposes within the corresponding functions of the app (for example, application for a customer card from a partner, login to your user account from a card provider, delivery of personalized offers (so-called card-linked coupons), the legality of this processing (for example, forwarding the data to third parties) is given on the basis of your consent. 
Granted consent can be revoked at any time. This also applies to the revocation of declarations of consent that have been granted to us before the applicability of the GDPR, therefore before May 25, 2018. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the data processed until revocation.</p>
<h2 id="4-how-are-third-party-services-integrated">4. How are third-party services integrated?</h2>
<p>On the basis of our entitled interests in terms of art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR (this means interest in the analysis, optimization and efficient operation of our app), we use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Mixpanel: we use Mixpanel in our app - a service offered by Mixpanel Inc. (Mixpanel), 405 Howard Street, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA  to collect technical data from our app and website in a pseudo-anonymous manner so that we can better understand how users interact with our app. Mixpanel is used to be able to better understand and track activities within the app as well as to inform you based directly on your activities. You can find more information about Mixpanel at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/terms">https://mixpanel.com/terms</a>. You can opt out of this data processing at any time through <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout">https://mixpanel.com/optout</a>.</li>
<li>b) Firebase Analytics: We use the &quot;Firebase Analytics&quot; analysis service from Google Inc. (Google), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Firebase Analytics is designed to record how users interact with an app. Events are recorded such as the initial opening of the app, uninstallation, update, crash or frequency of use of the app. The events can be used to record other user interests as well, for example, for certain functions of the applications or certain topic areas. User profiles can also be recorded, which can be used as a basis for the illustration of advertising customized for users. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield agreement and offers a guarantee to comply with the European data protection regulations. You can view the privacy policy from Google here: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>. If you would like to opt out of this data processing, you can use the settings and opt out options provided by Google at <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences">https://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>.</li>
<li>c) AppsFly Software Development Kit (SDK): we use the AppsFlyer Software Development Kit (SDK) from AppsFlyer Ltd. within our app. 141 5th Avenue Suite 9, New York, NY 1001, United States. AppsFlyer allows for different evaluations regarding the success of our advertising campaign and the installation of the app. Our app sends anonymous data and information that the app was started to AppsFlyer for this purpose. An anonymous advertising ID serves as a pseudonym. Only statistical analyses are created through AppsFlyer. We, therefore, do not have any information about the user&#39;s identity. AppsFlyer is certified under the Privacy Shield agreement and offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection regulations. You can find more information about the AppsFlyer SDK at <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/product/data-privacy">https://www.appsflyer.com/product/data-privacy</a> You can opt out of this data processing at any time through <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/optout">https://www.appsflyer.com/optout</a>.</li>
<li>d) Facebook Software Development Kit (SDK): in our app, we use the Software Development Kit (SDK) from Facebook Inc. (Facebook), 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The Facebook SDK allows different types of evaluations on the installation of the app and regarding the success of the advertising campaign. Additionally, individual activities (events) from the user within the app can be analyzed to be able to define the target group for advertising campaigns in a more precise and better manner. Our app sends anonymous data to Facebook and the information that the app was started for this purpose. The advertising ID provided by the end device&#39;s operating system serves as a pseudonym. In the case of our app, however, the advertising ID does not serve to optimize advertisements through Facebook for the user, but rather is discarded by Facebook, because our app has prevented the use of the advertising ID for optimized advertising purposes by Facebook. We, therefore, do not have any information about the user&#39;s identity. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield agreement and offers a guarantee to comply with the European data protection regulations. You can find out more information about the Facebook SDK under iOS at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios</a>.
