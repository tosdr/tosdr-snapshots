        <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>

        <h3>Deletion Rights</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
        <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

            <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
            <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
        <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/contact-us?p=2">Form</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.  You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. </p>
        <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.  The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
            <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
        <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but we may require authentication of the consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested.  However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
        <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
        <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (for a maximum total of 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
        <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.  If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. </p>
        <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of a verifiable consumer request.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless the request is excessive or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.  Alternatively, we may decline to respond to the request and notify you of our reason for doing so.</p>
        <h3>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are 16 years of age or older and have obtained express consent from a parent or guardian to register as a panelist, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”).  We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is at least 16 years of age and less than 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 16 years of age.  Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
        <p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized agent) may submit a request to us by visiting our “Data Privacy Requests” webpage at Contact Us.  If your authorized agent submits a request on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide either (1) a copy of your written permission for the authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf and information sufficient to verify the authorized agent’s identity or (2) power of attorney pursuant to California’s Probate Code.</p>
        <p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights.  We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
        <p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.  However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by visiting <a href="/contact.aspx">Contact Us</a>.</p>
        <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>
