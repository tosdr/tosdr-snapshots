        <h3>5.	Privacy</h3>

        <h3>6.	Security Warning</h3>
        <p>We take commercially reasonable precautions and have implemented commercially reasonable technical measures intended to protect against the risks of unauthorized access to, erroneous disclosure of, and unlawful interception of information submitted via the Website. However, no system is perfect, and it is possible that other users or unauthorized “hackers” may post or transmit offensive or obscene materials on the Website and that you may be involuntarily exposed to such materials. It may also be possible for other users or “hackers” to obtain personal information about you. By using the Website, you assume the risk of such occurrences.</p>
        <h3>7.	Rewards</h3>
        <p>For each approved survey you complete at ProductReportCard.com, LLC you will be awarded the Reward amount specified on the Website or in the email invitation in connection with such survey. In certain circumstances, we may collect the Reward from the Company on your behalf and remit it to you. In other cases, the Company may provide Rewards directly to you upon your submission of completed versions of the claim documentation requested by Company. Your expressly acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To receive and redeem Rewards, each survey must be completed in full and your survey responses must be approved and accepted by the applicable Company. Possible reasons that a Company may reject your survey responses include, but are not limited to, the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>The time taken to complete this survey was noticeably shorter than other responses.</li>
                    <li>There was a conflict between multiple answers you provided within the survey.</li>
                    <li>Responses from open-ended questions were insufficient or did not make sense.</li>
                </ol>
                In some instances Rewards may be issued prior to review and acceptance of your survey responses by the applicable Company. In the event that survey responses are rejected by a Company for any reason, ProductReportCard.com, LLC will revoke all issued awards associated with the rejected survey. Where a survey is rejected and rewards are revoked, your Member Account balance will be adjusted to reflect only rewards earned prior to the date of such rejection. ProductReportCard.com, LLC records all instances where a member survey has been rejected and reserves the right to immediately terminate your Member Account due to such rejection. If your Member Account is terminated for any reason, ProductReportCard.com, LLC will permanently revoke all earned Rewards and you will not be entitled to and will not receive any compensation from us.
            </li>
            <li>Where we collect and administer your Reward on behalf of Company, provision of the Reward to you is contingent upon our receipt of the Reward from the applicable Company. In the event that any Company fails to provide the sufficient funds to satisfy the Reward to us, you agree that Company shall be solely liable for such failure and you shall look only to Company with respect to any claims you may have for the applicable Reward. For the avoidance of doubt, you expressly agree to release us and hold us harmless against any claim for any unpaid Rewards where the applicable Company has failed to provide the Reward to us.</li>
            <li>Where the applicable Company administers its own Reward program and provides Rewards directly to you, you agree that Company is solely responsible for such Reward and Company alone (and not ProductReportCard.com, LLC) is liable for any failure to pay such Reward or remit such reward in a timely manner. For the avoidance of doubt, you expressly agree to release us and hold us harmless against any claim for any unpaid Rewards where the applicable Company fails to provide the Reward to you.<br />
                You must complete the survey in full to receive the Reward amount. For Rewards administered by us, you must earn the minimum amount of Rewards required to make a redemption stated on the Website, as such may be amended from time to time. To redeem your Rewards, you may access the ‘Rewards’ area of the Website. Select the desired redemption option from those listed on the site and follow the instructions given to process your Reward. The rewards represented in the ‘Rewards’ area of the Website and the minimum redemption amount are subject to change by ProductReportCard.com, LLC at any time without prior notice. Rewards earned from participating in surveys are valid for one year from the award date. If unused on the 366th day after being deposited into your Member Account, your reward will expire and be removed from your Member Account Balance. For example, if you are awarded $5.00 on January 15, 2019 and by January 16, 2020, the expired $5.00 reward will be removed from your Member Account leaving a balance of $0.00. ProductReportCard.com, LLC will redeem rewards from your Member Account based upon the award date. Your “oldest” Reward funds will be deducted first, leaving your most recently earned Rewards in your Member Account.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>8.	Third-Party Rewards Partners</h3>
        <p>Rewards are provided by third party Rewards Partners and are subject solely to rules and restrictions imposed by such Rewards Partners with respect to usage requirements, restrictions on use, inactivity fees or expiration dates. All rewards are paid via Amazon.com gift cards and are issued as of the day upon which you redeem your Rewards and not the day you earn your Rewards. We do not have control over Amazon’s gift card management or services, and ProductReportCard.com, LLC assumes no liability, obligation or responsibility for, and makes no warranty with respect to, any restrictions, rules or policies that may be applicable to Amazon.com gift cards. For example, if you earn Rewards on January 1, 2020 and redeem your Amazon.com gift card on May 1, 2020, then: (a) Amazon.com is solely responsible for the rules, policies and restrictions governing such gift card; (b) the applicable date for determining the issuance of the reward is May 1, 2020, with respect to calculating expiration dates.</p>
