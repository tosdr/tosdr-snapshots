        <p id="term_1_1" class="term">
            1.1
            These General Terms and Conditions are referred to herein as
            “<i>Terms</i>” and apply between 1337 Services LLC (“<i>1337</i>”)
            as the provider of the Services (as defined under section
            <a href="#term_2_1">2.1</a> below) and you as as the user of the Services.
        <p id="term_1_2" class="term">
            1.2
            By accessing and/or using the Services you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms, which establish a contractual relationship between you and 1337.
        </p>
        <p id="term_1_3" class="term">
            1.3
            By using the Services and entering into these Terms you acknowledge that you are at least 18 years or older and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into any agreement with 1337.
        </p>
        <p id="term_1_4" class="term">
            1.4
            Additional conditions other than those provided in these Terms may apply to certain parts of the Services and will in such case be provided to you in connection with the event for which they are to apply (such as for specific promotions etc.). Such additional conditions shall be considered to be an integral part of these Terms. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.
        </p>
        <p id="term_1_5" class="term">
            1.5
            1337 has the sole right to at any time amend or supplement these Terms. Any such made changes to these Terms will be immediately effective after being posted at the same location as these Terms. By accessing or using any of the Services you will be considered to have accepted any such amendments or supplements of these Terms. Further to the above, you agree to be bound by any applicable regulations and/or terms of any registry operator governing the domain top level domain that you have registered through the use of the Services. In case of conflict between such other aforementioned regulations and/or terms and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail between you and 1337 to any possible extent.

        <h2>2. The Services</h2>
        <hr class="left">
        <p id="term_2_1" class="term">
            2.1
The Services consist of domain name registration, domain name renewal, domain name hosting (the “<i>Services</i>”),
unless otherwise specifically provided in the order receipt for purchased Services.
        </p>
        <p id="term_2_2" class="term">
            2.2
1337 reserves the right to change the content and/or the scope of the Services at any time. You shall always be entitled to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect in the event of any such change. No refunds will be made in case of such termination from you.
        </p>
        <p id="term_2_3" class="term">
            2.3
The Services are purchased on an annual basis, commencing on the date of 1337’s confirmation of purchased Services, and are renewed annually subject only to your due payment according to these Terms. Such payment shall be received by 1337 not later than on such date communicated by 1337 in the notification mentioned under section
<a href="#term_5_3">5.3</a> below, or 1337 will have the right to immediately terminate the provision of the Services and these Terms, as stipulated below under section <a href="#term_9_2">9.2</a>.
Such termination will have the effect that 1337 may, at its discretion, choose to assume the registered domain name and hold it in its own account or let it expire. If 1337, in its sole discretion, chooses to renew the registration, you will be entitled to a grace period of 42 days during which you may re-register the domain name with 1337. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will then apply.
        </p>
        <p id="term_2_4" class="term">
            2.4
            1337 is not responsible for renewing the Services if you fail to duly pay for renewal of the Services before or on the due date of the renewal fee.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Registration</h2>
        <hr class="left">
        <p id="term_3_1" class="term">
            3.1
            You must provide an email or XMPP address to 1337 in order for 1337 to provide the Services to you, and you must always ensure that such contact information provided to 1337 is always up to date so that 1337 can always reach you and provide you with invoices.
        </p>
        <p id="term_3_2" class="term">
            3.2
            A domain name submitted via 1337 will be deemed active when the relevant registry operator accepts your application and activates your requested domain name. 1337 does not guarantee that you will obtain the domain name applied for, even if your inquiry has indicated that the applied for domain name is available at the time of application.
        </p>
        <p id="term_3_3" class="term">
            3.3
            Domain names are registered under the name of 1337 and not under your name, unless you specifically so request. You are aware that this means that 1337 is registered as the registered owner of the domain name. However, 1337’s position is that of a middleman and 1337 shall not have actual ownership of the domain name in relation to you. Such ownership shall vest in you from date of registration of the domain name. You may however at any time request that the registration of the domain name is transferred to you formally meaning that you will be registered as the owner of the domain name with the registry operator in question. A precondition of the transfer is, however, that you agree in writing to be bound by any agreements and terms to which 1337 is bound as a registrant of the domain name.
        </p>
        <p id="term_3_4" class="term">
            3.4
            If you are purchasing the Services as a private person, you are entitled to withdraw from the Services and the Terms by written notification to 1337 within 14 days of the date stated in the order confirmation. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, you shall not be entitled to withdrawal if you have requested that 1337 shall start performing the Services during the withdrawal period and/or if you have started to use the Services. After payment of the Services is made, registration of the domain name will be immediately initiated and you will therefore not be entitled to withdraw from the Services or these Terms thereafter in accordance with the above.

A breach of sections <a href="#term_4_2">4.2</a> and/or <a href="#term_9_2">9.2</a>, inter alia, shall be considered a “material breach” in the meaning of this section.
