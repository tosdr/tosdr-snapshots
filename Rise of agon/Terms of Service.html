You agree to the resolution of any and all disputes arising under these TOS and the EULA, or actions to enforce the terms of these TOS or the EULA, in the exclusive jurisdiction of Ontario Courts and waive any objection to such venue or exclusive jurisdiction.</p><h3></h3><h3>19. Additional Toxic Rain Studios LLC Remedies</h3><p>You agree that your compliance with these TOS and the EULA is necessary and reasonable in order to protect Toxic Rain Studios LLC and its business, and you expressly agree that monetary damages alone would be inadequate to compensate Toxic Rain Studios LLC for any breach of these TOS or the EULA. Accordingly, you agree and acknowledge that any such violation or threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to Toxic Rain Studios LLC and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, equity, or otherwise, Toxic Rain Studios LLC will be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of the Agreement or the continuation of any such breach by you, without the necessity of a bond or proving actual damages.</p><h3></h3><h3>20. Severability of Provisions</h3><p>If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any term, covenant, or restriction of these TOS or of the EULA to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining terms, covenants, and provisions will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated. If any provision in these TOS or the EULA is determined to be unenforceable in equity because of its scope, duration, geographical area, or other factor, then the court making that determination will have the power to reduce or limit such scope, duration, area, or other factor, and such provision will then be enforceable in its reduced or limited form.</p></div>
