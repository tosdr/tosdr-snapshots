You hereby agree to the jurisdiction of the appropriate judicial tribunal in the province of Ontario. You agree to the resolution of any and all disputes arising under these TOS and the EULA, or actions to enforce the terms of these TOS or the EULA, in the exclusive jurisdiction of Ontario Courts and waive any objection to such venue or exclusive jurisdiction.<br/><br/><b>19. Additional Big Picture Games Remedies</b>.<br/> You agree that your compliance with these TOS and the EULA are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Big Picture Games and its business, and expressly agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Big Picture Games for any breach of these TOS or the EULA. Accordingly, you agree and acknowledge that any such violation or threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to Big Picture Games and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, equity or otherwise, Big Picture Games will be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of the Agreement or the continuation of any such breach by you, without the necessity of a bond or proving actual damages.<br/><br/><b>20. Severability of Provisions</b>.<br/> If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any term, covenant or restriction of these TOS or of the EULA to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining terms, covenants and provisions will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If any provision in these TOS or the EULA is determined to be unenforceable in equity because of its scope, duration, geographical area or other factor, then the court making that determination will have the power to reduce or limit such scope, duration, area or other factor, and such provision will be then enforceable in its reduced or limited form.</p><ul><li>The content must be used in a non-commercial context for private, personal use only unless explicit permission has been given in writing by Big Picture Games.</li><li>You must include all copyright and other notices associated with the content.</li><li>You will not create or display and any content or videos of the Game or the World that alter the content in a negative manner to misrepresent the content or gameplay in a negative way.</li><li>You acknowledge and agree any use of Rise of Agon content does not in any manner impart on you any rights whatsoever and that any content is the property of Big Picture Games and has not been conveyed to you except as permitted in these TOS and the EULA.</li><li>You agree that Big Picture Games has the right to request removal of your content at any time, for any reason or with no given reason. </li><li>You acknowledge and agree that you will not use our content on sites that contain or link to sites containing hacks or cheats, pornography, inflammatory content, infringing or unlawful content, racial or sexist slurs &amp; content.</li></ul></div>
