    provides: (1) websites
    located at <a href="https://www.ui.com" title="www.ui.com">www.ui.com</a> and ui.com sub-domains and any
    other websites hosted by Ubiquiti or its affiliates
    (collectively the “<span class="textBold">Sites</span>”), (2) software and services accessible or downloadable through the Sites
    (“<span class="textBold">Web Apps</span>”), (3) software
    and services accessible or downloadable through Your smartphone or tablet (“<span class="textBold">Mobile Apps</span>”)
    and (4) subscription
    services, including services that can be accessed using the Web Apps and Mobile Apps (“<span class="textBold">Subscription Services</span>”),
    all
    for use in conjunction with Ubiquiti hardware products (“<span class="textBold">Products</span>”) and for other
    software and services that Ubiquiti provides.
    The term “<span class="textBold">Services</span>” means the Sites, Web Apps, Mobile Apps and Subscription Services.
  	
</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Service (these “<span class="textBold">Terms</span>”) govern Your access to and use of the Services.
    The term “<span class="textBold">You</span>,” “<span class="textBold">Your</span>,” “<span
        class="textBold">you</span>”
    or “<span class="textBold">your</span>” as used in these Terms, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the
    Services and any person or

    You authorize to access or use the Services, including Your independent contractors or employees (“<span
        class="textBold">Authorized
    Users</span>”). For the avoidance of doubt, where the term “You,” “Your,” “you” or “your” is used in these Terms, it
    shall
    include any Authorized User, regardless of whether “Authorized User” is specifically stated. For Services that You
    receive from a third party distributor or reseller, these Terms govern any rights and obligations between You and
    Ubiquiti, and govern Your use of such Services.

<p class="textBold">

                        more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral, third-person arbitrator
                        instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to
                        very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court
                        can award. Please visit <a href="https://www.iccwbo.org" title="ICC" target="_blank">https://www.iccwbo.org</a>

                In order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, You need to (I) mail written notification to Ubiquiti Inc., 
              Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017; or (II) email
                written notification to <a href="mailto:legal@ui.com">legal@ui.com</a>. In either case, Your written notification must include: (1) Your
                name, (2) Your address, (3) a copy of Your receipt or other proof of purchase, showing the date of
                purchase, and (4) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Ubiquiti through
                arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship
                with Ubiquiti. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must
                pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or, if the dispute qualifies, in small claims court.

                <span class="textBold">Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</span>: For all disputes, whether pursued in
                court or in mandatory arbitration, You must first give Ubiquiti written notification and forty-five (45)
                days to resolve the Dispute. The written notification shall include the information listed above in the

                arbitration. You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described above in
                Section IX(b), the Opt Out provision.

                        pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti will, within ten (10)
                        business days of receipt of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee, reimburse You for the
                        amount of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee that exceeds the amount of any fees You would
                        be required to pay if the Demand were filed in federal court in the Southern District of New

                        conducted in English and a translator may be utilized as the expense of the party requiring the
                        translation services. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary
                        place of business in New York, New York will be appointed pursuant to the Rules. You and
                        Ubiquiti agree to the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution
                        process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (a) subject to the Rules, the
                        arbitration shall be conducted online via videoconference, telephonically and/or be solely based
                        on written submissions-rather than requiring the personal appearance of the parties-with the
                        specific manner to be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties and (b) any judgment on the
                        award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                        days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an
                        additional thirty (30) days in the interests of justice upon written notice by the arbitrator to
                        You and Ubiquiti at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the last date to issue his or her

                        and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court
                        confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will

                        will apply the laws of the State of New York in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that
