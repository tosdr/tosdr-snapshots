      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the SearchItWithUs Site and Services and is independent of any other site, services, or application(s) you may be installing or using concurrently. The SearchItWithUs Site and Services are provided and maintained by SearchItWithUs, which may be referred to herein as "SearchItWithUs," "We," "Us," or "Our" whether in uppercase, lowercase, or a combination.</p>
      
      <p>We want you to know that We care about your privacy and We will never intentionally collect personally identifiable information or monitor usage on an personally identifiable individual level.</p>

      <h4 class="text-primary">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

      <p>Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the internet, computers, mobile technologies, and other technologies, in Our attempts to make Our user experience better, and for other aesthetic and business reasons, We may change, update and modify the Privacy Policy from time to time. We will attempt to notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on Our site at https://searchter.com/ and perhaps more specifically at https://searchter.com/privacy.php or in some other reasonable manner so You may always make yourself aware or be aware of what has changed. If any modification is unacceptable to You, You shall cease using the Site and Services right away. If You do not cease using the Site and Services, You will be conclusively deemed to have accepted the change(s). Except as stated elsewhere, any amended Privacy Policy shall automatically be effective as soon as it is initially posted except if We state that We are giving advance notice of any amended term to be effective on a date in the future. You agree that it is your responsibility to check the Privacy Policy and any guidelines periodically for changes. Except as posted by Us this Privacy Policy may not be otherwise amended, and no term may be waived by Us, except in a writing, hand signed by pen on paper (or as set forth below) by You and an authorized representative of Ours. For purposes of this provision, a "writing" does not include an email message, text, chat, or the like, sent from any device existing now or later developed and a signature does not include an electronic signature.</p>

      <h4 class="text-primary">Information we collect during Usage of the Site or Services</h4>

      <p>We do not monitor the web pages you visit. When you perform a search, your search may be sent through Our servers in order to optimize the search result. This will record the following information:</p>

      <h4 class="text-primary">How we use the Information we collect</h4>

      <h4 class="text-primary">Information collected by Third Parties</h4>

      <p>Search results pages you visit when performing a search using our Site or Services are provided by Our search engine partners (e.g.,Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, eBay, Amazon, Namespace, etc.). These search engines can and might track a variety of data, including the following:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>That the search request came from the relevant Site and its associated revenue tag</li>
        <li>MAC and operating system data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We suggest that you consider visiting the sites of these search engines to learn their privacy policies and more information about what they collect, as well as to determine how you may attempt to prevent the collection of such information, or clear such information. Some of these search engines are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).

      <h4 class="text-primary">Use of Cookies, Pixels, and Web Beacons</h4>

      <p>When you conduct a search using the Site, Our content providers who supply search results (e.g., Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, etc.) may set or access cookies on the computer or device where the search is performed from. The cookies are typically used for the purpose of measuring referrals from Our Site on an aggregate basis and are not tied to your personal information, except for your IP Address, and usually as may be otherwise disclosed in the privacy policies of these providers. Many browsers offer users the option of declining or deleting cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, or you wish to delete cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. (A cookie is message given to a web browser by a web server. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. There are many resources available on the internet that explain in greater detail what cookies are, what types of cookies exist, and what they do.) We may also use small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters called cookies to improve overall Site experience, among other things. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive or browser containing information about the user. Information from cookies alone generally do not provide us with information to personally identify You. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie generally disappears after You close Your browser. A persistent cookie remains after You close Your browser and may be used by Your browser on subsequent visits to a SearchItWithUs Site or other web sites. Persistent cookies can generally be removed by You. Please review Your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify Your cookie settings and to remove cookies. We may also use pixels or web beacons on our Site. (See, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons</a>>.)</p>

      <h4 class="text-primary">Notice to European Users</h4>

      <p>The information You enter on or through a Site or Service or otherwise provide to Us may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms https://searchter.com/terms.php and this Privacy Policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by Us on our servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
