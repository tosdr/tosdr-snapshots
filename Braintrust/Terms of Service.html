Each Agency Member further acknowledges and agrees that: (x)&nbsp;the Agency Owner may determine the Profile visibility and pricing/rate information of any of its Agency Members, and (y)&nbsp;Agency Members’ Profiles may display work history that includes work done under the Agency Account, including after the Agency Member is no longer an Agency Member.</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, Site Service Fees, Taxes and Gas Fees apply to your transactions through the Site Services. Neither we nor any of our affiliates are responsible for determining the Taxes that apply to such transactions.</p>
<p><strong>(b) </strong>Transactions in digital assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in digital assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, digital assets, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Site Services and the utility of BTRST.</p>
<p><strong>(d) </strong>There are risks associated with using Internet based digital assets, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software, and Internet connection and service issues, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your digital wallet. We will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when effecting transactions involving supported digital assets, however caused, including Gas Fees paid or payable in connection therewith.</p>
<p><strong>(e) </strong>A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of any digital assets.</p>
<p><strong>(f) </strong>Blockchain systems may have vulnerabilities or other failures, or experience other abnormal behavior. We are not responsible for any issues with the blockchains, including forks, technical node issues, or any other issues that may result in fund losses. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to or from the Site Services. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing the Site Services. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using and interacting with the Site Services.</p>

Governing Law and Forum Choice.&nbsp; </strong>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 28 “Disputes Between You and Talent Node,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Talent Node are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the County of New Castle, Delaware,&nbsp; and you and Talent Node each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
      </div>
      
        
      <div class="tabs_item" id="item_28">
          <p><strong>28. Disputes Between You and Talent Node.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site Services (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Talent Node agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Talent Node are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Exceptions.</strong> As limited exceptions to Section&nbsp;28(a) above: (i)&nbsp;we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii)&nbsp;we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Arbitration Costs.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section&nbsp;28(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>(f) Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND TALENT NODE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 28 shall be null and void.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">(g) Severability.</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> With the exception of any of the provisions in Section&nbsp;28(f) of these Terms (“</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Class Action Waiver</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</span></p>
