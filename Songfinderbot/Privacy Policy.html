<title>SongFinderBot Terms of Use and Privacy - Pigeonburger.xyz</title>
<h1 style="color: red;">SongFinderBot Terms of Use and Privacy</h1>
<p><i>Throughout this document, 'the developer' refers to the developer of SongFinderBot, as a program operating on both Twitter and Discord, while 'the operator' refers to any individual invoking SongFinderBot to perform a task. 'The bot' refers to SongFinderBot, both on Twitter and Discord.</i></p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the developer and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals in any form between you and the developer. If any part of this Terms of Use agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall remain in effect.</p>
<p>You can contact Pigeonburger (the developer) through <a href="/contact">https://pigeonburger.xyz/contact</a> at any time regarding any questions.</p>
<br>
<h2>User Agreement:</h2>
<p>By using and operating the bot you accept all the following terms of use, and you accept responsibility for anything it produces by your actions, including accepting responsibility for any legal outcomes or consequences resulting from the operation of the bot. By using the bot you also relieve the developer of any legal responsibilities or liabilities regarding anything the bot produces.</p>
<p>The developer grants permission to share and distribute any of the bot's produced replies that are compliant with these terms of use.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>User Conduct:</h2>
<p>Excessive use of the bot in a way that is considered 'spam' is forbidden. Doing so will result in a permanent and irreversible block from using the bot by the developer.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Inappropriate Use:</h2>
<p><b>The following is considered inappropriate use by the developer:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the bot to process media containing <i>ANY KIND OF</i> pornography or other content deemed to be for an 18+ audience (including non-consensual nudity).</li>
<li>Using the bot to process media depicting child sexual exploitation or content related to pedophilia or any other related offenses.</li>
<li>Using the bot to process media that depicts graphic violence or promotes/incites acts of violence or hate towards an individual or group of individuals. This includes (but is not limited to) terrorism/violent extremism and hateful conduct such as acts of harassment towards other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.</li>
<li>Using the bot to process media that promotes abuse/harrassment towards an individual or group of individuals.</li>
<li>Using the bot to process media that promotes use of illegal goods and/or illegal activities.</li>
<li>Using the bot to process media containing someone's private information.</li>
<li>Using the bot to promote false information.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Privacy:</h2>
<p>The only information collected and stored on the developer's server is the name of the song, the song artist, and URLs (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer) related to the song. The sole purpose for storing this data is for caching, so that the bot is able to reply faster the next time the same song is identified. No other information, anonymous or personally identifiable, is collected.</p>
<p>The bot downloads the media provided by the user in order to perform the song recognition. Upon completing the song recognition, the downloaded media is immediately deleted and removed from the program.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Limitation of liability:</h2>
<p>You understand that the bot (and any content served on this website relating to the bot) is solely a free public service that can be operated by anyone, and you agree that the developer will not be responsible for any damages that you claim result, directly or indirectly, from use of the bot or this website, for any reason, including costs incurred while using the bot or the website, the inaccessibility of the bot or the website, or the costs associated with any claims you bring or try to bring against the developer.</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT WILL the developer OR ITS FUNDERS OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE BOT OR THE WEBSITE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE BOT, THE WEBSITE OR ANY LINKED SITES, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER USER RELATED TO, ARISING FROM, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH USE OF THE SITE, YOU RELEASE the developer FROM ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE.</p>
<P>These limitations apply whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, our liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.</P>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Indemnity:</h2>
<p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY the developer AND ANY OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, OWNERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, INFORMATION PROVIDERS, FUNDERS, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS AGAINST, AND HOLD THE developer's PARTIES HARMLESS FROM, LIABILITY, LOSSES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEY’S FEES) INCURRED AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR CLAIMS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH USE.</p>
<p>For example, and without limitation, if you use the bot or this website to do something illegal, you agree not to sue us if another party takes action against you for it, and if you do sue us you would have to pay our costs and attorney’s fees in defending that action. Also, if any other party takes action against you or if your property is damaged in connection with your legal use of the bot and this website, even if that use is permitted by these Terms of Use, you agree not to sue us. If you try to sue us even though you have agreed not to do so, you would be responsible for our costs and legal fees in connection with our defense of that suit.</p>
