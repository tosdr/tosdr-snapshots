          disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
          third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any

            <li>obtain access to or a copy of your personal information with accompanying details;
            <li>receive an electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that

            <li>change, update, or correct your personal information;</li>
            <li>withdraw your consent to process your personal information;</li>
            <li>request that we restrict or limit our use of your personal information;</li>
            <li>request to opt-out of certain processing activities including, as applicable, if we process your
              personal information for “targeted advertising” (as “targeted advertising” is defined by applicable privacy laws), if we “sell” your personal information (as “sell” is defined by applicable privacy laws), or if we engage in profiling in furtherance of certain decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you;</li>

              href="smartnews://openDataControlSetting" target="_blank">here</a> for details).
            If you have any questions, please contact us as set forth below. Please note that there may be technical
            limitations that prevent us from fulfilling certain requests. We may carry out deletion requests by

If we do not receive this identifier when you make a request, we will not be able to verify your identity and will deny your request.</p>
          <p>If applicable laws grant you an appeal right and you would like to appeal our decision with respect to your request, you may do so by informing us of this and providing us with information supporting your appeal.</p>

          <h2>How Long Do We Retain Your Information?</h2>

          <p>This Supplemental Notice for California Residents only applies to our processing of personal information that is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended from time to time) (“CCPA”). The CCPA provides California residents with the right to know what categories of personal information SmartNews has collected about them, whether SmartNews disclosed that personal information for a business purpose (e.g., to a service provider), whether SmartNews “sold” that personal information, and whether SmartNews “shared” that personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” in the preceding twelve months. California residents can find this information below:</p>

              information that are known only to you (e.g., device tokens, recently viewed articles, locations where you
              have used our application, etc.) or sending a push notification to your device and requesting a response.
              However, for requests for the disclosure of specific pieces of personal information, we will also request
              you to follow the same procedure as set forth in (1) above.</li>
          </ol>
