        <h1>SmartNews Terms of Service</h1>

        <h2>Last Updated: September 1, 2023</h2>

        <p>Welcome to SmartNews! You are now reading the Terms of Service (the <b>“Terms”</b>) that serve as an
          agreement between you and SmartNews, Inc. (<b>“SmartNews,”</b> <b>“we,”</b> or <b>“us”</b>) for your use of
          our mobile device application (<b>“App”</b>), and our news mining and delivery services, accessible via our
          App. To make these Terms easier to read, our services, the Site and the App are collectively called the
          <b>“Services.”</b></p>

        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, please do not

        <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know by posting the
          modified Terms on the App or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever
          we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms, you are
          indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the
          modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may

        <p>If you accessed or downloaded the App from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple Store,

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These Terms are concluded between you and SmartNews, and not with App Provider, and that, as between
            SmartNews and the App Provider, SmartNews, is solely responsible for the App.</li>
          <li>App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
          </li>
          <li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify App Provider
            and App Provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum
            extent permitted by applicable law, App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with
            respect to the App. Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
            failure of an App to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of SmartNews.</li>
          <li>App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party
            relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product
            liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory

          <li>In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that
            third party’s intellectual property rights, SmartNews will be solely responsible for the investigation,
            defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent
            required by these Terms.</li>
          <li>App Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license
            of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, App Provider will
            have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your
            license of the App against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</li>
          <li>You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the App.</li>
          <li>You agree to comply with all U.S. and foreign export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the App
            nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof is exported or re-exported directly or

            App you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.
            Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country;
            and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p><b>Governing Law</b></p>
        <p>If you are a resident outside of Japan, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the
          laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions, and the English version of
          these Terms shall take precedence over the Japanese version. If you are a resident of Japan, these terms will
          be governed by the laws of Japan without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions, and the Japanese version
          of these Terms shall take precedence over the English version.</p>
        <p><b>Agreement to Arbitrate</b></p>
        <p>You and SmartNews agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or
          the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content
          (collectively, <b>“Disputes”</b>) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the
          right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable
          relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation
          or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights
          (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an <b>“IP Protection Action”</b>). The exclusive
          jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the
          Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue
          in such courts. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND SMARTNEWS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
          OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
          Further, unless both you and SmartNews otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
          than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
          proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution”
          section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section
          will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
        <p><b>Arbitration Rules</b></p>
        <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<b>“AAA”</b>) in accordance
          with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the
          <b>“AAA Rules”</b>) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules
          are available at <a href="www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at
          1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
        </p>
        <p><b>Arbitration Process</b></p>
        A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration
        as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a
          href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a>
        and a separate form for California residents at <a
          href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>.)
        The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by
        the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within
        seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance
        with the AAA Rules.
        <p><b>Arbitration Location and Procedure</b></p>
        <p>Unless you and SmartNews otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
          If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the
          documents that you and SmartNews submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
          determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be
          determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
          reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
        </p>
        <p><b>Arbitrator’s Decision</b></p>
        <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s
          decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
          Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s
          award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the
          types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
          injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
          by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of
          attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SmartNews will not seek, and hereby
          waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in
          arbitration.</p>
        <p><b>Fees</b></p>
        <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in
          the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SmartNews will pay all such fees
          unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for
          Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
        <p><b>Changes</b></p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if SmartNews changes this
          “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes
          to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to
          info@smartnews.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last
          Updated” date above. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you
          and SmartNews in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first
