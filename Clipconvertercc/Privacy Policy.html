</p>
<h5>
    III. General information on data processing
</h5>
<p>
    1. Scope of processing personal data
</p>
<p>
    In general, we only process the personal data of our users to the extent
    necessary to provide a functioning website with our content and services.
    The regular processing of personal data only takes place with the consent
    of the user. Exceptions include cases where prior consent cannot be
    technically obtained and where the processing of the data is permitted by
    law.
</p>
<p>
    2. Legal basis for data processing
</p>
<p>
    Where consent is appropriate for processing personal data, Art. 6 (1) (1)
    (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis to obtain the consent of the data
    subject for the processing of their data.
</p>
<p>
    As for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a
    contract of which the data subject is party, Art. 6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR serves
    as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to
    carry out pre-contractual activities.
</p>
<p>
    When it is necessary to process personal data in order to fulfil a legal
    obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) (1) (c) GDPR serves
    as the legal basis.
</p>
<p>
    If vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require
    the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) (1) (d) GDPR serves as the
    legal basis.
</p>
<p>
    If the processing of data is necessary to safeguard the legitimate
    interests of our company or that of a third party, and the fundamental
    rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the interest of the
    former, Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR will serve as the legal basis for the
    processing of data.
</p>
<p>
    3. Data removal and storage duration
</p>
<p>
    The personal data of the data subject will be erased or restricted as soon
    as the purpose of its storage has been accomplished. Additional storage may
    occur if this is provided for by the European or national legislator within
    the EU regulations, law, or other relevant regulations to which the data
    controller is subject. Restriction or erasure of the data also takes place
    when the storage period stipulated by the aforementioned standards expires,
    unless there is a need to prolong the storage of the data for the purpose
    of concluding or fulfiling the respective contract.
</p>
<h5>
    IV. Rights of the data subject
</h5>
<p>
    When your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the
    meaning of the GDPR and have the following rights:
</p>
<p>
    1. Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)
</p>
<p>
    You may request the data controller to confirm whether your personal data
    is processed by them.

    </li>
    <li>
        The existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority.
    </li>
    <li>
        If applicable, origin of the data (if collected from a third party).
    </li>
    <li>
        If applicable, existence of automated decision-making including

    <li>
        If applicable, transfer of personal data to a third country or
        international organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    2. Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)
</p>
<p>
    You have a right to rectification and/or modification of the data, if your
    processed personal data is incorrect or incomplete. The data controller
    must correct the data without delay
</p>
<p>
    3. Right to the restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
</p>
<p>
    You may request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
    under the following conditions:
</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        If you challenge the accuracy of your personal data for a period that
        enables the data controller to verify the accuracy of your personal
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of the personal
        data and instead request the restriction of their use instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        The data controller or its representative no longer need the personal
        data for the purpose of processing, but you need it to assert, exercise
        or defend legal claims; or
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have objected to the processing pursuant and it is not yet
        certain whether the legitimate interests of the data controller
        override your interests.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    4. Right to erasure ("Right to be forgotten") (Art. 17 GDPR)
</p>
<p>
    If you request from the data controller to delete your personal data
    without undue delay, they are required to do so immediately if one of the
    following applies:
</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Personal data concerning you is no longer necessary for the purposes
        for which they were collected or processed.
    </li>
    <li>
        You withdraw your consent on which the processing is based pursuant to
        and where there is no other legal basis for processing the data.
    </li>
    <li>
        You object to the processing of the data and there are no longer
        overriding legitimate grounds for processing, or you object pursuant to
        Art. 21 (2) GDPR.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your personal data has been processed unlawfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        The personal data must be deleted to comply with a legal obligation in
        Union law or Member State law to which the data controller is subject.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your personal data was collected in relation to information society
        services offered pursuant to Art. 8 (1) GDPR.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The right to deletion does not exist if the processing is necessary
</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        to exercise the right to freedom of speech and information;
    </li>
    <li>
        to fulfil a legal obligation required by the law of the Union or Member
        States to which the data controller is subject, or to perform a task of

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    5. Right to data portability
</p>
<p>
    You have the right to receive your personal data given to the data
    controller in a structured and machine-readable format. In addition, you
    have the right to transfer this data to another person without hindrance by
    the data controller who was initially given the data, if:
</p>
<p>
    6. Right to object
</p>
<p>
    For reasons that arise from your particular situation, you have, at any
    time, the right to object to the processing of your personal data pursuant
    to Art. 6 (1) (1) (e) or 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling
    based on these provisions.
</p>
<p>
    If the personal data relating to you are processed for direct marketing
    purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of
    your personal data in regard to such advertising; this also applies to
    profiling associated with direct marketing.
</p>
<p>
    7. Right to complain to a supervisory authority
</p>
<p>
    Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have
    the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider
    that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR. The
    supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform
    the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the
    possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78 GDPR. A list, of the locally
    competent supervisory authorities in Germany can be found on the website of

<h5>
    V. Provision of website and creation of log files
</h5>
<p>
    1. Description and scope of data processing
</p>
<p>
    Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data
    and relevant information from the computer system of the calling device.
</p>
<p>
    The following data is collected:
</p>
<ol start="5" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Browser type and version used
    </li>
    <li>
        The user's operating system
    </li>
    <li>
        The IP address of the user
    </li>
    <li>
        Date and time of access
    </li>
    <li>
        Web pages from which the user’s system accessed our website
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This data is stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored
    together with other personal data of the user.
</p>
<p>
    2. Purpose of data processing
</p>
<p>
    The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary for the
    delivery of the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the
    user’s IP address must be kept for the duration of the session.
</p>
<p>
    The storage in logfiles is done to ensure the functionality of the website.
    The data is also used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of
    our IT systems. An analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not
    take place.
</p>
<p>
    For the aforementioned purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the
    processing of data in compliance with Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    3. Legal basis for data processing
</p>
<p>
    The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and logfiles is Art. 6
    (1) (1) (f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    4. Duration of storage
</p>
<p>
    The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the
    purpose of its collection. The session is complete when the collection of
    data for the provision of the website is accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at
    the latest. Storage beyond this is possible. In this case, the IP addresses
    of the users are deleted or alienated so that an assignment of the calling
    client is not possible.
</p>
<p>
    5. Objection and removal
</p>
<p>
    The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of
    the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the
    website. The user can object to this. Whether the objection is successful
    is to be determined within the framework of a balancing of interests.
</p>
<h5>
    VI. Use of cookies

<p>
    2. Purpose of data processing
</p>

    The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to ensure the
    functionality of our website. Some functions of our website cannot be
    offered without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary that the

    3. Legal basis for data processing
</p>
<p>
    The regulations of the Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act
    (TTDSG) are relevant for the storage of information in the end user's
    terminal equipment and/or access to information already stored in the end
    user's terminal equipment. If the setting and reading of cookies is
    technically necessary, this is done to ensure the functionality of our
    website. In this case, the storage of and access to cookies on your
    terminal equipment is carried out on the basis of § 25(2)(2) TTDSG. This
    storage of and access to the information in your terminal equipment serves
    to facilitate your use of our website and to be able to offer you our
    services as you have requested. Some functions of our website also do not
    work without the use of these cookies and could therefore not be offered.
    The cookies are generally deleted after the session ends (e.g. logging out
    or closing the browser) or after the expiry of a specified duration.
    Information on different storage periods for cookies can be found in the

<p>
    <br/>
    On our company profile we provide information and offer Instagram users the
    possibility of communication. If you carry out an action on our Instagram
    company profile (e.g. comments, contributions, likes etc.), you may make
    personal data (e.g. clear name or photo of your user profile) public.
    However, as we generally or to a large extent have no influence on the
    processing of your personal data by Instagram, we cannot make any binding
    statements regarding the purpose and scope of the processing of your data.
</p>
<p>

    done on the basis of your express declaration of consent, Art. 6 (1) (1)
    (a), Art. 7 GDPR. The legal basis for processing personal data for the

    (1) (1) (f) GDPR. Thereby, our legitimate interest is to answer your
    request optimally or to be able to provide the requested information. If
    the aim of contacting you is to conclude a contract, the additional legal

<h5>
    IX. Hosting
</h5>
<p>
    The website is hosted on servers of a service provider commissioned by us.
</p>
<p>
    Our service provider is:
</p>
<p>
    OVH GmbH
    <br/>
    Christophstraße 19
    <br/>
    50670 Köln
    <br/>
    Deutschland
</p>
<p>
    The servers automatically collect and store information in so-called server
    log files, which your browser automatically transmits when you visit the
    website. The stored information is:
</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Browser type and version
    </li>
    <li>
        Used operating system
    </li>
    <li>
        Referrer URL
    </li>
    <li>
        Hostname of the accessing computer
    </li>
    <li>
        Time and date of the server request
    </li>
    <li>
        IP address of the user's device
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This data will not be merged with other data sources. The data is collected
    on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a
    legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and
    optimization of his website - and server log files are therefore recorded.
</p>
<p>
    The server of the website is geographically located in the European Union
    (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA).
</p>
<h5>
    X. Geotargeting
</h5>
<p>
    We use the IP address and other information provided by the user (e.g. the
    postal code used for registration or ordering) to approach regional target
    groups (so-called "geotargeting").
</p>
<p>
    The regional target group approach is used, for example, to automatically
    display regional offers or advertisements that often are more relevant to
    users. The legal basis for the use of the IP address and any other
    information provided by the user (e.g. postal code) is Art. 6 (1) (1) (f)
    GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in ensuring a more precise target
    group approach and thus providing offers and advertising with greater
    relevance for our users.
</p>
<p>
    Part of the IP address and the additional information provided by the user
    (e.g. postal code) are merely processed and not stored separately.
</p>
<p>
    You can prevent geotargeting by, for example, using a VPN or proxy server
    that prevents accurate localisation. In addition, depending on the browser
    you are using, you can also deactivate a location localisation in the
    corresponding browser settings (as far as this is supported by the
    respective browser).
</p>
<p>
    We use geotargeting on our website for the following purposes:
</p>
<ol start="10" type="I">
</ol>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>
        Geoblocking
    </li>
</ul>

    OVH GmbH (Hereinafter referred to as OVHcloud). A Content Delivery Network
    (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers connected via the
    Internet to deliver content, especially large media files such as videos.
    OVHcloud offers web optimization and security services that we use to
    improve the load times of our website and to protect it from misuse. When
    you visit our website you will be connected to the servers of OVHcloud,

    evaluated in server log files, the user's activity (e.g. which pages have
    been visited) and device and browser information (e.g. IP address and
    operating system). Further information on the collection and storage of
    data by OVHcloud can be found here:
    https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/personal-data-protection/
</p>
<p>
    2. Purpose of data processing
</p>
<p>
    The use of OVHcloud features serves to deliver and accelerate online
    applications and content.
</p>
<p>
    3. Legal basis for data processing
</p>
<p>
    The data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR. The website
    operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free
    presentation and optimization of his website -and the server log files are
    therefore recorded.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

    fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
