This section applies to all California residents (but not including legal entities, such as companies). The section will not apply, however, if MaxRewards does not collect any personal information about you or if all the information we collect is exempt from the statute (for example, the CCPA does not protect information that is already protected by certain other privacy laws, and it does not protect information that is already publicly available). For purposes of this section regarding the rights of California residents, “personal information” does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the public from federal, state, or local government records; and the words “you” or “your” specifically refers to California Consumers.</p><h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">1. You have a Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold.</h4><p>You have the right to request that MaxRewards disclose what personal information we collect, use and disclose. This is called the “Right to Know”. Under the Right to Know, you can request a listing of the types of personal information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information, other individuals and business with whom we share personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.</p><p>If you would like the above information, you may contact us through our webpage or customer service. When you make a request under your Right to Know, you can expect the following:</p><ol type="a"><li>We will verify your identity.

If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.</li><li>We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, to process your request.</li><li>In certain cases, a Request to Know may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you the information could create an unreasonable risk to someone&#x27;s security (for example, we do not want sensitive information disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. If we deny a request, we will still try to provide you as much of the information as we can, but we will withhold the information subject to denial.</li></ol><p>In the last 12 months, we have collected the categories of personal information described above under the section “Categories of Personal Information Collected.” All such information was collected from sources as described above and for the purposes described above. We only disclose such information to third parties as described in the section “Disclosures and Transfers of Personal Information”.

If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, to process your request.</li><li>In certain cases, a Request for Deletion may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity, the law requires that we maintain the information, or if we need the information for internal purposes such as providing Services or completing an order. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it.</li></ol><p>Note that simply deleting the app from your mobile device may not result in the deletion of your personal information. [Even if you request that your personal information be deleted, MaxRewards may retain certain information regarding how you use the App or the Services for our internal analytics purposes.]</p><h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">3.
