use of the Subscription.  To avoid charges for a new Subscription period, you must cancel the Subscription before the end of the then-current Subscription period in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 below or the instructions set forth in the App (if any).  If you cancel your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but you will not be eligible for a prorated refund and your Subscription will not be renewed when that period expires.</li></ol><li><u>Account Responsibilities</u>.  You are responsible for maintaining the

your Account.  You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security.  You are solely liable for any claims,

Waiver</strong>.</li><ol class="list-decimal pl-[2ch]"><li><u>Dispute Resolution</u>.  Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.  It is part of your contract with the Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute.  Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings.  The following procedures apply to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.</li><li><u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</u>.  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</li><li><u>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</u><em>.</em>  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong class="font-semibold">Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 75 5th St NW, Ste 2210, Atlanta, GA 30308.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</li><li><u>Rules for Arbitration.  </u>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration before one arbitrator in Atlanta, Georgia, unless the parties agree to a different location.  The arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS&#x27;s Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<strong class="font-semibold">JAMS Rules</strong>”).  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any arbitrability issues including any dispute over these Terms or this arbitration provision&#x27;s scope, application, meaning, and enforceability.  The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court.  Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction.  This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.  If the request to proceed in small claims court is made before an arbitrator has been appointed, any open arbitration between the parties shall be administratively closed.  If an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be decided in small claims court.  Arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or the Company invoke the right to an oral hearing before the arbitrator.</li><li><u>Time Limits</u>.  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.</li><li><u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u>.  You and the Company expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  This means that if for any reason the Arbitration Agreement contained in Section 17 is not enforced or is found inapplicable, or either of us file the action in small claims court, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.</li><li><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</u>.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</li><li><u>Confidentiality</u>.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li></ol><li><strong class="font-semibold">General</strong>.</li><ol class="list-decimal
