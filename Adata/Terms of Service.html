Therefore, memory is also called buffer memory and cache memory. In a computer, the memory also exists in various forms, such as cache memory inside the CPU, buffer memory inside the hard disk, and the video memory on the graphics card (Video Memory). ). In this article, we will be introducing system memory - the DRAM installed on the motherboard.\n\nComputers have hard drives which store data permanently as magnetic information, but even with the improved speed of today's hard drive technology. Hard drives are still too slow to keep up with the needs of the CPU since it can operate on considerably more information per second than can possibly be transferred to and from the hard drive. This is where the need for a fast, short-term memory solution comes in, a memory space that provides very fast access for the CPU so data can be written and read as needed without slowing down the system when performing task such as streaming movies, processing images, or running games.\n\n(The key function of memory is to act as a buffer between the high-speed CPU and low-speed hard disk.)","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keyword":"","index_brief":"Many people who are new to computers often confuse memory with hard drives as both are listed in regards to capacity on specification tables.
