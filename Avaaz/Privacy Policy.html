      Why do we collect your information?
     </h3>
     <p>
    Avaaz is a global civic movement and the participation of people like you is crucial to achieving our mission. To keep the network thriving, growing, and effective, we collect information from members and website users so we can more efficiently and creatively communicate with and mobilize our members, create, promote and fund our campaigns, interface with decision-makers, campaign targets, and the media, and develop new, more effective methods of outreach to grow the Avaaz network.
</p>
     <h3 class="h3_blue" id="what-info">
      What information do we collect from you?
     </h3>

      Do we share your information?
     </h3>
     <p>Avaaz does not rent or sell your personal information and we will only share it with the parties described below, as required by law, or with trusted third parties with your permission.</p>
     <ul class="privacy-policy-indent1">
      <li>
       <strong>Targets of Avaaz campaigns</strong>
       : When you sign an Avaaz petition, the target of the campaign is sent a final list including the name, city, country, and any comments of everyone who signed. Where the target is a government body or official that requires petition signers to be constituents, we may also provide your postal code and full address.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Avaaz volunteers and event hosts</strong>
       : From time to time, Avaaz volunteers or event hosts may have access to your contact information, including your name, email address, telephone number, and social media account IDs, to reach out to you about a specific campaign or event. They may contact you directly or through an Avaaz or third-party contact tool at Avaaz’s direction.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Avaaz Community Petition creators</strong>
       : When you sign a petition created on the Avaaz Community Petitions platform, we provide your name, city, and country to the petition creator so they can deliver it to the campaign target.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Collaborating organizations &amp; the media</strong>
       : Sometimes we work with the media or other groups to amplify our impact. In these cases, we may share your name, city, country, and any comments you have made when signing a petition with our partners to submit to a campaign target. If you live in the UK, we may contact you on behalf of Avaaz Campaigns UK, a UK-registered company limited by guarantee, about UK-specific campaigns.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Service providers</strong>
       : We work with a wide range of service providers, notably our database administrators, cloud computing services, help desk services, advertising services, data analysts, application service providers, bulk SMS services, voter phone banking services, and other non-governmental organizations. These providers work under strict confidentiality agreements. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services. Please note that we also use survey applications on external platforms, such as SurveyMonkey and Wufoo, to collect information from those who voluntarily fill out our surveys on these platforms. The personal information of survey participants will be transferred to Avaaz and is subject to this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Payment processors</strong>
       : We work with PayPal, Global Collect, and Stripe to help process credit card transactions and other payment methods when you donate to Avaaz. These payment processors will store certain personal information about you. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn more about how they use your personal information. If you choose to become an Avaaz sustainer, or select the EasyDonate option, your payment information will be stored with your chosen payment processor, and you will give Avaaz explicit permission to trigger donations. Avaaz does not store your credit card account number or banking details. You can edit your EasyDonate preferences on your
       <a href="https://avaaz.org/en/profile/" target="_blank">profile page</a>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Facebook marketing</strong>
       : We may use your email address and Facebook ID to participate in Facebook’s Custom Audience and Lookalike Audience programs, which enable us to display campaign promotions to both existing and prospective members when they visit. To do this, we first send a digital fingerprint of your data to Facebook -- not your actual personal information -- and they check if it matches a fingerprint of their data. If you’re a match, Avaaz campaign promotions may then appear when you access Facebook. Facebook deletes this information (a) if it does not match with a Facebook account or (b) after they confirm you are a registered account holder. For more detailed information please see

      <li>
       <strong>Affiliated Third Parties</strong>
       : In the future, we may transfer your personal information to a third party as a result of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar transaction. We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give you notice before personal information is transferred. If there are material changes in relation to the processing of your personal information, we will give you an opportunity to consent to such changes.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Election Officials</strong>
       : We take our obligation to comply with local election rules seriously. If you donate to an Avaaz election or referendum-related campaign, we ask that you donate only if you are a citizen or eligible voter of the relevant country. We may need to make your name, address, postal code, occupation, and the amount and date you donated available to election officials in order to comply or show compliance with the relevant election law. The specific donation page will give you full information.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Protection of Avaaz and others</strong>
       : We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Avaaz if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your personal information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues, enforce our Terms of Use, meet any enforceable government request or court order, defend against legal claims, or protect against harm to the legal rights or safety of Avaaz, the Avaaz staff, or members of the Avaaz community.

     <p>Avaaz is a global organization with members and staff around the world, so your information may be transferred and stored across borders.</p>
     <p>
    We use standard industry practices, such as firewalls and encryption, to safeguard your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. All donations, including the transmission of payment details and other personal information, are handled over secure, encrypted connections. We take reasonable steps to ensure that cross-border data transfers comply with existing data protection laws, such as working with third party processors certified in the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks or with those that use standard contractual clauses that bind parties to protect the privacy and security of data.
</p>
     <p>
    We hold on to your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected, unless otherwise required by law. If you request that we stop sending you updates and other communications or delete your information, we will honor your request and keep the minimum amount of information possible to prevent fraud and to help ensure that you are not contacted again.

      <li>
       Object: You can object, on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your personal information, including direct marketing and profiling.

      What is the lawful basis for processing your information?
     </h3>
     <p>When we process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases: </p>
     <ul class="privacy-policy-indent1">
      <li>
       <strong>Consent</strong>
       : We will ask for your consent to use your information to send you details about our campaigns, fundraisers, and action opportunities, for targeted advertising and profiling, and if you ever share sensitive personal information with us.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Contractual relationships</strong>
       : When you donate to us, apply for employment, or otherwise enter into a contract with us, we’ll need to process your personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Legal obligations</strong>
       : When strictly necessary, we’ll process your personal information due to a binding legal obligation on us.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>Legitimate interests</strong>
       : So long as our use is fair, balanced, and doesn’t unduly impact your rights, we will collect and process your personal information when we have a legitimate interest that serves the Avaaz mission, our services, or our activities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>Processing your Sensitive Personal Data</strong>: We do not seek to collect or otherwise process your sensitive personal information (i.e. about race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, etc.) except where:</p>
     <ul class="privacy-policy-indent1">
      <li>

      What about personal information we collect about third parties?
     </h3>
     <p>To further our mission, Avaaz may collect, store, and process the personal information of third parties for public interest purposes: to report on matters of public concern, to protect freedom of expression and democracy, and to equip decision makers with critical information and analysis.
</p>
     <p>
    For these purposes, we may collect, alone or in collaboration with trusted third parties, individual’s name, contact, and other identifying information, images, photographs, audio, or video, social media account profiles and information posted or shared via such accounts.
</p>
     <p>
    We may collect such data from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, publicly available information, information provided by Avaaz members or others participating in our work, social media platforms and APIs, research databases, fact-checking organizations, and platform analysis software. We’ll keep such data secure and review its retention to ensure its processing remains necessary to our public interest purposes.
</p>
     <p>
    We’ll only process such data for purposes permitted under US law, and where applicable, permitted and a proportionate use under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, for example where the processing serves our public interest purposes and does not unfairly affect the rights of others, or has been made public by the individuals concerned.
</p>
     <p>
    Any person about whom we may hold personal information in the European Union and European Economic Area and Switzerland, has the same rights as users as detailed in <a href="#how-we-update">How can you update and correct your personal information?</a><strong>However, we may not be able to comply with a request where these rights are subject to an exception, for example where we are processing data for journalistic or academic purposes.</strong> Other exceptions include where the use of the personal data is in connection with the prevention and detection of crime or where it is legally privileged.
</p>
     <p>
    We will disclose third party data, in the following circumstances: if there is a compelling reason as described above in <a href="#do-we-share">Do We Share Your Information?</a>; as described below in <a href="#protection">More on Protection of Avaaz and Others</a>; or if aligned with our public interest purposes, we may share data with social media platforms, media organizations, fact-checking organizations, decision-makers, and regulatory and law enforcement agencies. </p>

      More on Protection of Avaaz and Others
     </h3>
     <p>We believe you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information you disclose online that is not clearly intended for public dissemination. Where possible, we may attempt to defend this principle even though most jurisdictions currently take the opposition position.
</p>
     <p>
    We may attempt not to disclose material in response to overzealous or inappropriate requests. When we have a good faith belief that the law compels us to do so or when we think justice would be served, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court orders requesting or directing us to disclose personal information of any user of this site.

      We Are Not Responsible for User Contributions
     </h3>
     <p>We cannot review everything that is posted by users in advance, so any content and/or opinions uploaded, expressed or submitted to the site, and all User Contributions, including, articles, responses to questions, and other content, other than the content officially provided by Avaaz, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity submitting them and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Avaaz. <u>We are not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by you or any other user of this website and you agree to bear full responsibility for the content you post to the site</u>. While we try to investigate all credible complaints about objectionable User Contributions, we cannot ensure individual responses or removal of such content.

      Enforcement of Terms
     </h3>
     <p>Because the purpose of this website is to serve the Avaaz mission on behalf of the Avaaz community, in order to ensure that it is used only for its intended purpose and that no use of the site endangers Avaaz’s broader mission, Avaaz has the right to:</p>
     <ul class="privacy-policy-indent1">
      <li>
       Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason. This is a decision Avaaz will strive to make fairly, but ultimately it is a decision that is solely up to Avaaz to make. It will be our general practice, however, to consult with our members including through randomized polling to determine what user contributions our membership views as advancing our mission. At all points in this process we will welcome feedback from the community on how we make these decisions as it is the community’s ability to achieve our mission that we are here to serve. But in the end, Avaaz has a legal obligation to ensure that all of our activities advance our mission and we therefore must reserve final judgment on upholding this requirement.
      </li>
      <li>
       Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right, threatens the personal safety of users of this website and the public or could create liability for Avaaz.
      </li>
      <li>
       Disclose your identity to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy. We will not do this lightly, but if we think it has the potential to facilitate a fair and just resolution of the dispute, or will protect Avaaz from liability for which we are not responsible, we may take this step. See More on Protection of Avaaz and Others in our Privacy Policy.
      </li>
      <li>
       Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of this website when we determine law enforcement is the proper and appropriate means for addressing the offending use.
      </li>
      <li>
       Terminate your access to all or part of this website for any violation of these Terms of Use.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>You waive and hold harmless Avaaz from any claims resulting from any action taken by Avaaz during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either Avaaz or law enforcement authorities.</p>
