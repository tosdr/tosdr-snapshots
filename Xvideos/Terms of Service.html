<p><strong>A</strong>. WebGroup is committed to fostering a safe and secure online environment for users of the Website. WebGroup does not tolerate the display or dissemination of any Submissions that violate applicable laws or these Terms of Service (such as child sexual abuse material, non-consensual sexual acts, privacy violations, abuse, harassment, etc.) on the Website and upon becoming aware of such illegal Submissions, WebGroup will expeditiously remove or disable access to them.</p>
<p>In addition to our <strong>notice and action procedure</strong> (as described below), WebGroup undertakes voluntary own-initiative investigations in good faith and diligent manner, aiming to detect, identify, and remove or disable access to illegal Submissions. These efforts include employing avant-garde automated detection technologies capable of identifying various types of illegal content, supplemented by manual review conducted by our well-trained team of human content moderators. Furthermore, Submissions undergo thorough checks for malware, viruses, or other malicious software prior to uploading. Ultimately, the decision to remove a Submission, rests with the human content moderator. WebGroup does not utilize algorithmic decision-making for content moderation.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of responsible content moderation, WebGroup is ready to work closely with certified Trusted Flaggers from the European Economic Area (" <strong>EEA</strong>") to swiftly identify and address any Submissions that violate these Terms of Service or applicable laws. This cooperative effort reflects our commitment to upholding the highest standards of user safety and promoting a positive online experience for all. Through this collaborative approach, we aim to continuously improve our content moderation processes and maintain a platform that prioritizes the well-being of our users and the integrity of our online community. Trusted Flaggers from the EEA who have been certified by the relevant Digital Services Coordinator can join our Trusted Flagger programme here: <a href="https://info.xvideos.net/trusted-flaggers">https://info.xvideos.net/trusted-flaggers</a>, and have their notices and complaints prioritised.</p>
<p><strong>Notice and Action Procedure (Non-Copyrighted Content)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. If you come across any Submission on our Website that you consider to be illegal or in violation of these Terms of Service for any reason other than copyright infringement, we encourage you to report it by submitting a take-down notice, either via:</p>
<p>(i) abuse reporting form available here: <a href="https://info.xvideos.net/takedown-amateur">https://info.xvideos.net/takedown-amateur</a>;or</p>
<p>(ii) reporting form, which you can find after pressing the "Report" button accompanying each video on our website.</p>
<p>You must fill at least the following information in the reporting form:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sufficiently substantiated explanation of the reasons why you allege the Submission in question to be illegal content; AND</li>
<li>a clear indication of the exact electronic location of that Submission, such as the exact URL or URLs, and, where necessary, additional information enabling the identification of the Submission adapted to the type of content and to the specifics of the Website; AND</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your take-down notice may not be valid or may be delayed in processing.</strong></p>
<p>Upon receiving the take-down notice, the reported Submission is <strong>temporarily suspended</strong> (not accessible to public) pending WebGroup's decision on the notice. If you entered your email address into the reporting form, WebGroup will, without undue delay, send you a confirmation of receipt to your email. The respective notice is then reviewed and validated by WebGroup's human content moderators. WebGroup processes all notices in a timely, diligent, non-arbitrary, and objective manner. If the reviewing team has any doubts while considering the notice, it may provide the uploader with the opportunity to comment on the notice. If the reported Submission is assessed as illegal or in violation of these Terms of Service, it is deleted. Uploader located in the EEA is then provided with a statement of reasons. If, upon review of the notice, we find no violation of applicable laws or these Terms of Service, then the visibility of the Submission is restored. In all cases, we will inform the person who reported the Submission about how the notice was resolved. Recipients located in the EEA have a right to appeal against WebGroup's decision by lodging a complaint throughout WebGroup's internal complaint-handling system described in Article 13.1. of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Obviously, any instance of illegal Submissions, such as CSAM, Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery ("NCII"), terrorist content, or other Submissions that gives rise to suspicion that criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of a person or persons has taken place, is taking place or is likely to take place will be reported to the competent state authorities. <strong>WebGroup will also immediately delete such Submission and ban the associated user account</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>. WebGroup does not permit copyright infringing activities or infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and will expeditiously remove infringing content in response to a valid takedown request.</p>
<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your copyright, submit a copyright infringement takedown request available at <a href="https://info.xvideos.com/takedown">https://info.xvideos.com/takedown</a>with the form containing the following information:</p>

If you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the takedown request or counter-notification claimant and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request or counter-notification as prescribed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (" <strong>DMCA</strong>"). Where the party against whom you are making your takedown request resides outside the EEA, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit your personal data exclusively for the purpose of assessing the merits of your takedown request and will notify the recipient of the data of this limited purpose and the confidential and sensitive nature of your personal data. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and we do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.</p>
<p>You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the uploader of the material at issue in line with the Privacy Notice if you do not have an account and in line with the Privacy Policy if you have an account.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Counter-Notification Process</strong></p>
<p>When an uploader's video Submission has been removed, the Website will notify the uploader of this removal. Pursuant to the Website's policies and in accordance with the DMCA, the uploader has five 5 days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown request was sent in error. The counter-notification may be sent to WebGroup's email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.</p>
<p>For the Website to consider a counter-notification, it must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a physical or electronic signature of the uploader; AND</li>
<li>identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; AND</li>
<li>a statement under penalty of perjury that the uploader has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; AND</li>

<li>a statement that the uploader consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the uploader's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; AND</li>
<li>a statement that the uploader will accept service of process from the takedown request claimant or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your counter-notification related to the relevant takedown request and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, we will process your personal data and will provide the party who originally made the takedown request with your completed counter-notification, which will include the following personal data: your name, and contact information, as well as the content of your counter-notification. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the addresses of your takedown request or counter-notifications and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request as prescribed under the DMCA. Where the takedown request claimant resides outside the EEA, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit any personal data included in your counter notification exclusively for the purpose of processing your counter-notification and will notify the recipient that any personal data included in your counter-notification is of confidential and sensitive nature. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.</p>
<p>You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the takedown request claimant in line with the Privacy Notice (if you do not have an account) and in line with the Privacy Policy if you have an account.</p>
<p>That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials.<br>Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible. We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked. Uploaders located in the EEA are then provided with a statement of reasons. Recipients located in the EEA have a right to appeal against WebGroup's decision by lodging a complaint throughout WebGroup's internal complaint-handling system described in Article 13.1. of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat Infringers Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> For any Submission not involving CSAM, Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery (" <strong>NCII</strong>"), terrorist content, or other Submissions that gives rise to suspicion that criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of a person or persons has taken place, is taking place or is likely to take place, the Repeat Infringers Policy does not apply because the account holder responsible for any such Submission will be banned and the corresponding account(s)will be deleted for good.</p>
<p>For any other violations of these Terms of Services, including copyright infringements, WebGroup has established a policy for addressing users who repeatedly upload illegal Submissions. If, a user is found to have uploaded illegal Submission to the Website, the respective account will receive a "strike". WebGroup's content moderator may delete a strike if the user proves that it was clearly a mistake or an accidental or isolated incident. <strong>After accumulating three strikes, the user's account is deleted and his other access to the Website is terminated</strong>.</p>

<h3>9. Recommender System Transparency</h3>
<p>The criteria influencing the display of videos on the Website vary depending on the specific section of the Website visited by the user. On the main page, key factors include (i) the user's chosen location (country) and, within that location, (ii) the video's popularity, determined by the total number of clicks from recipients. Users can easily modify these parameters by selecting a different location on the Website' online interface. Beyond the main page, the selection of suggested videos is also influenced by the chosen 'category' (sub-genre) or a particular content creator. Users can easily impact this by selecting a different category or choosing another content creator within the Website's online interface.</p>
<p>Users may also search for specific type of content using keywords. In this case, the decisive criterion is the match between the entered keyword(s) and the video's title or 'tags' and within such searched videos, their popularity. Tags are more detailed textual specifications of the video. For instance, a 'tag' may represent one or more specific sub-categories or a particular model(s) featured in the video.The Website also provides a feature of suggesting 'related' videos which is based on viewing history of all users. When 'view history' is enabled, the system suggests more relevant videos based on the context of the respective video, considering criteria such as 'popularity', 'categories' or 'tags'.</p>

<h3>13. Internal Complaint-Handling System, Dispute Resolution, Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, Venue and Forum</h3>
<p><strong>13.1 Handling complaints internally</strong></p>
<p>Upon a decision from WebGroup:</p>
<ol>
<li>about whether or not to remove or disable access to or restrict visibility of information that is the subject of a complaint; or</li>
<li>about whether or not to suspend or terminate the provision of the service, in whole or in part, to one or more recipient(s); or</li>
<li>about whether or not to suspend or terminate the account of the recipient(s); or</li>
<li>about whether or not to suspend, terminate or otherwise restrict the ability to monetise information provided by the recipients,</li>
</ol>
<p>on the grounds that the information provided by the recipients constitutes illegal content or is incompatible with WebGroup's Terms of Service, recipients of the service shall be able to lodge complaints against the decision of WebGroup, electronically and free of charge. Recipients shall have the right to lodge such complaints for 6 months from the date they are informed of the relevant decision. Recipients may submit a complaint through their user account interface [INSERT A LINK TO THE RELEVANT SECTION OF THE USER ACCOUNT INTERFACE] or through the designated link that was emailed to them by WebGroup.</p>
<p>WebGroup shall handle such complaints submitted through its internal complaint-handling system in a timely, diligent, non-discriminatory and non-arbitrary manner, under the supervision of qualified content moderators, and not solely on the basis of automated means. Where appropriate, WebGroup shall reverse its decisions as a result of the complaints. Recipients located in the EEA shall be provided with a reasoned decision in respect of the information to which the complaint relates and of the possibility of out-of-court dispute settlement (as described under 13.2 of these Terms of Service) and other available possibilities for redress.</p>
<p><strong>13.2 Out-of-court dispute settlement bodies available to recipients located in the EEA</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the other dispute resolution mechanisms set out in this Clause, in relation to any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with content that is, or has been alleged to be, illegal or incompatible with WebGroup's Terms of Service, recipients located in the EEA (namely in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) may refer the matter to any of the out-of-court dispute settlement bodies certified in accordance with Art. 21 of the Digital Services Act.</p>
<p><strong>13.3 Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Either Party may refer any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service to arbitration.</p>
<p>Before bringing a formal legal case in arbitration, you must send a written notice of dispute (" <strong>Notice of Dispute</strong>") via registered mail to "WebGroup Czech Republic, a.s., Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution- Subject: Notice of Dispute" to give WebGroup the opportunity to resolve the dispute with you informally, as also indicated in Section 12 of these Terms of Service. Similarly, before commencing a formal legal case in arbitration against a counterparty, WebGroup will send a Notice of Dispute to the counterparty's registered address.</p>
<p>The Notice of Dispute must contain sufficient information to identify the claiming Party ("<strong>Claimant")</strong> and the basis of its claim. Amicable consultations will commence upon WebGroup's or counterparty's receipt of a Notice of Dispute.</p>
<p>You and WebGroup agree to negotiate the dispute in good faith for no less than 30 days after a valid Notice of Dispute is provided. If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you agree that ANY and all existing and/or future controversy and/or claim between you and WebGroup shall be resolved as follows:</p>
<p><strong>i. No Class Actions</strong></p>
<p>Neither you nor WebGroup may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim or dispute. Claims or disputes may not be arbitrated or resolved on a class or representative basis.</p>
<p><strong>ii. You and Webgroup Agree to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p>You and WebGroup agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or WebGroup's services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, through final and binding arbitration.</p>
<p>An arbitration proceeding is before neutral arbitrators instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms of Service, you and WebGroup agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury with respect to any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service referred to arbitration.</p>
<p>This agreement applies to all claims except those identified in Section 13 (v). This agreement applies even after you stop using or choose to delete your xvideos.com account.</p>
<p><strong>iii. The Arbitration Process</strong></p>
<p>The Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic (" <strong>Arbitration Court</strong>") will conduct any arbitration between you and WebGroup, except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech law. The parties agree that the Rules of the Arbitration Court are applicable and will govern. You may read the Rules of the Arbitration Court here at <a href="https://en.soud.cz/rules">https://en.soud.cz/rules</a>. This webpage address is potentially subject to change as it is not under WebGroup's control. If any terms in these Terms of Service conflict with any Rules of the Arbitration Court, the parties agree to follow these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (" <strong>Arbitrators</strong>") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Court in effect at the time the Notice of Dispute was filed or received by WebGroup. The resulting award shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Prague, Czech Republic; the proceedings shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic; and the language of arbitration shall be Czech, unless (i) the parties agree otherwise, or (ii) unless Claimant elects English as the language of arbitration, or (iii) unless any applicable local laws dictate a particular language for the arbitration.</p>
<p>The parties agree that any disputes concerning the enforceability, validity, or scope of the arbitration agreement in this Section 13 (or any portion of it) shall be resolved by the Arbitration Court, which will have sole authority to decide those issues.</p>
<p>The parties further agree not to pursue injunctive relief (i.e., an order that the other party do or not to do something, apart from paying damages) in arbitration. Such relief must be sought in court instead. If a party has a dispute for which they seek to obtain both injunctive and other forms of relief, the party must go to court to seek the injunctive relief and must arbitrate to seek the other forms of relief.</p>
<p><strong>iv. Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong></p>
<p>If you start an arbitration in accordance with the Terms of Service, you will be required to pay the Arbitration Court's initial filing fees. If you are a non-EEA Claimant, you will not be responsible for paying any other fees of the Arbitrators, since all other fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrators will be paid by WebGroup. Additionally, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, WebGroup will pay that too. If you are an-EEA Claimant, you and Webgroup will be responsible for paying the respective fees of the Arbitrators, and WebGroup won't pay but for its fair shares of the Arbitrators fees. Similarly, if you are an-EEA Claimant, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, WebGroup will not pay that. Based on the ultimate outcome of the arbitration, the Arbitrators may decide in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party or parties in the arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>v. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p>You and WebGroup further agree that the Czech District Courts in Prague, Czech Republic (and not an arbitral tribunal), will have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes:</p>
<p>a. relating to non-EEA Claimant's or WebGroup's intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents) ("<strong>IP")</strong>; if you are an EEA Claimant you will still be required to arbitrate IP disputes, OR</p>
<p>b. regardless of whether you are an EEA or a non-EEA Claimant, where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief, including where a party seeks other forms of relief but is bound, as per Section 13 (ii), to seek those other forms of relief through arbitration; OR</p>
<p>c. regardless of whether you are an EEA or a non-EEA Claimant, any other judicial proceedings which by law is not subject to arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 Other dispute resolution alternatives</strong></p>
<p>In the event your local law prohibits arbitration, you may submit a motion for the extrajudicial handling of your dispute to the designated authority for extrajudicial handling of the consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection Authority (<a href="https://www.coi.cz/">www.coi.cz</a>).</p>
<p>Disputes arising from contracts on service provision concluded online between a consumer with residency in the European Union and a trader established in the European Union can also be resolved using the online dispute resolution platform at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a> .</p>
<p>Alternatively, should either of you and WebGroup not wish to pursue arbitration, you agree, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, that either of you may commence proceedings before the Czech general courts, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in which at least one of the parties to the dispute is a consumer, unless mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country provide as a further alternative that a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Service be handled by the court of the jurisdiction where you reside or are domiciled. If you are acting as an individual consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence or domicile contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Czech law or of Czech courts. Should an election be made in favour of the Czech or other national courts, arbitration will no longer be available under Section 13 of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Section 13 of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your relationship with WebGroup.</p>
<h3>14. Governing Law</h3>
<p>You agree that the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, WebGroup's Services and any claims or disputes arising out of, relating in any manner to or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or WebGroup's Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, except for the laws of the Czech Republic that govern conflict- or choice-of-law. The substantive law of the Czech Republic shall control, to the fullest extent permitted by law. The laws of the Czech Republic shall also govern any matters relating to the arbitration agreement between you and Webgroup, including that arbitration agreement's validity, scope and interpretation.</p>
<h3>15. Separation of Terms</h3>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of any such provision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which still apply and are binding.<br>Any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.</p>
<h3>16. General</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service, the privacy policy, the rules as written on the upload form, and any other legal notices published on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and WebGroup. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any other Term, and WebGroup's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.</p>
