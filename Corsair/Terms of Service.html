PRICE AND TERMS OF PAYMENT</strong></p>       <p>         While we take care to ensure that all prices quoted on our webstore are         accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any         Product(s) you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and         give you the option of reconfirming the order at the correct price or         cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, the order will be         treated as cancelled and if you have already paid for the Product(s) you         will receive a full refund.       </p>       <p>         We are under no obligation to sell the Product(s) to you at the         incorrect (lower) price (even after we have sent you an Order         Confirmation) if the pricing error is an obvious typographical or         arithmetical inaccuracy and could have reasonably been recognized by you         as such.       </p>       <p>         We reserve the right to decline orders for bulk or high value purchases         and to change price and availability information without notice.       </p>       <p>         We reserve the right, at any time before our acceptance, to notify you         of: (i) any revision in the prices of the Products to factor in any         changes to the cost of the Products. Such changes include without         limitation changes to the tax rate or levy and any variation in the         applicable exchange rates; and/or (ii) any changes to the description of         the Products. If you choose to continue with the fulfilment of your         order, you acknowledge and agree that the Product will be sold to you in         accordance with such revised price and/or description.       </p>       <p>         The countries in which we can deliver the Products are set out in the         Corsair webstore.

We shall not be liable for any         billing errors unless you advise us of such billing error within fifteen         (15) working days from the date of acceptance.

SOFTWARE</strong></p>       <p>         All software (including pre-loaded software contained in hardware) is         provided subject to such software's end user license agreement.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>       <p>         IN NO EVENT SHALL CORSAIR, THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR         AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR         PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE,         DATA OR PROFITS, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF         LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SALE,         EVEN IF CORSAIR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN         NO EVENT WILL CORSAIR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF         CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU         FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO YOUR DAMAGES. The         foregoing limitations will apply even if any warranty or remedy provided         under this Agreement fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions         do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential         damages or other limitations set forth above, so the above limitations         or exclusions may not apply to you.       </p>       <p>         Without prejudice to the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted         by law, we shall have no liability to you if the Products infringe or         are alleged to infringe any rights (including intellectual property         rights) of any third party.       </p>       <p><strong>7.
