We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).

Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or Services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services.

These Cookies help us to size our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li><li>Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services. They do this by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) to you through the Services. These trackers enable advertising technology providers to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. These trackers allow advertising technology providers to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. </p><p><strong>Data Security </strong></p><p>We seek to protect Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data.
