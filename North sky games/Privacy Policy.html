        <p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
    </div>

    <div align="left">

        <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>

        <p>This privacy policy is effective as of June 29th 2023.</p>

        <p>North Sky Games Inc ("North Sky Games", "we", "us") has developed this Privacy Policy to help you understand
            how we collect, use and protect the information we may acquire through your use of any North Sky Games game
            or any website operated by North Sky Games (the "Services"). Your privacy is important to us and we
            encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you can make informed decisions about your use
            of the Services. North Sky Games develops and publishes games for desktop and mobile device.</p>

        <p>By installing, playing our games or otherwise accessing our services, you agree to the use of your
            information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, you should
            not be playing our games or accessing our services.</p>

        <p><b>2. Collection of Information</b></p>

        <p>We collect information from a variety of sources, but most of it comes from you when you play our games or
            interact with our services. The information includes the type of devices you are using, how you play our
            games as well as information you submit when creating an account with us by connecting to your social
            networking accounts through our games or Services. We may also collect information from our advertising
            platforms and partners and other third parties.</p>

        <p><i>2.1 Mobile Analytics</i></p>

        <p>North Sky Games uses analytics software to allow us to better understand how our games are used by our users.
            This software may record information such as how often you use our games, specific events that occur within
            the game, performance data, crash reports as well as aggregate usage. We do not link any of that data to any
            personal information that you submit within the mobile application. We use the data provided to create
            reports, analysis or similar services for use by us for the purpose or research or business intelligence.
            For example, we may use analytics to track specific trends within our games or to test out new features and
            content.</p>

        <p><i>2.2 Social Networks</i></p>

        <p>When playing our games, you will be offered the option of connecting with social networks such as Facebook.
            North Sky Games will then receive information about you from the third-party and use that information to
            create an account with PlayFab for the game. The account will be linked with the social networking account
            and will include some personal information such as your first and last name, user ID number (like your
            Facebook ID number), login email, physical location, friends list as well as any additional information that
            you or the provider shares with us.</p>

        <p>The account created with PlayFab will then periodically save your personal progress within our games. This
            can include statistics, currencies earned or purchased, unlocked content, level achieved, leaderboards and
            tournament rewards and any additional information the game needs to fully restore your progress. Connecting
            a new device to your account will then load your progress unto that device, ensuring that your progress is
            never lost.</p>

        <p><i>2.3 Ad Networks</i></p>

        <p>North Sky Games may feature advertising within our games and Services. We use a variety of advertising
            partners, including ad exchanges, ad networks and ad servers. Our advertising partners help us serve
            advertisements to you within our games. Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you
            play our games or the services of others. This privacy policy does not apply to the collection of your
            information by our advertising partners.</p>

        <p>Advertisers on mobile devices use your device’s advertising identifier to optimize their advertising. You can
            choose to prevent your device’s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising or you can reset
            your device’s ad identifier by changing the settings on your device. Settings will vary for each device but
            will usually be found under privacy or ads in your device’s settings.</p>

        <p><i>2.4 Customer Service</i></p>

        <p>We use the information you provide us directly in communications to provide you with support through our
            customer service system. The information provided may include information about platform and device type you
            are using, account information is connected with our service, name and email address. We will use the
            information provided to provide you with the help you need and will only retain the communications as long
            as needed or required by law.</p>

        <p><i>2.5 IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework</i></p>

        <p> North Sky Games participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its
            Specifications and Policies. North Sky Games uses the Consent Management Platform with the identification

        <p>
            - With your consent, we may share your information with third parties or allow them to collect information

            it.<br>
            - North Sky Games works with third party vendors to provide you with services within the games. Such
            third-party vendors include Analytics providers, customer support and account services (PlayFab) used to
            store and manage your account information. While providing these services to North Sky Games, these
            providers may have access to your personal information.<br>
            - When you submit information as part of a competition or participate in an in-game event or tournament, we
            may publish the information you submitted alongside your name on our website and social media channels.<br>
            - If North Sky Games becomes involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of
            some or all of North Sky Games’ assets, user information, including personal information collected could be
            included as part of the sale. Should such an event occur, North Sky Games will use reasonable means to
            notify you through a prominent notice on our Services.<br>
            - We disclose information to respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal processes as well as to

        <p><b>5. Accessing and Managing your Information</b></p>

            can also manage some aspects of the information collected by visiting the settings on your mobile device and
            reviewing the permissions for each app.</p>

        <p>You have a right to know what information we have about you and in some cases to have that information

            to retain some of that information for other purposes, such as maintaining financial records or for legal
            purposes.</p>

        <p>There are other ways by which you can control the information we collect about you. You can disconnect the
            game from social networks or delete our games from your devices. You could also reset your mobile
            advertising identifier or limit ad tracking altogether using the settings on your phone. Note that you will
            still receive advertising but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated apps.</p>

        <p><b>6. Data Retention</b></p>

        <p>We will keep your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes described above, or as long as the
            law allows. We use third party services to store your data, including PlayFab and Amazon Web Services to
            process and store your information for us.</p>

        <p>Even if information is changed or deleted, we may still retain some of the information to resolve disputes,
            enforce our user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the
            security, integrity and operation of Services.</p>
