        <p class="para">Your first step should be to make sure your question has everything necessary for someone to be able to answer your question. For example, any relevant images, graphs, or data. The next step would be to post a link to your question in the chat (never post the question itself). If there is still no reply, tag users by posting @username on the question. Even if they may not be able to answer the question itself, they may know someone who can!</p>

        <p class="para">Sometimes lower-SS users may appear above higher-SS users. There are a few reasons for this: for one, it may be a glitch. It usually happens when the server and client fall out of sync, so the server sends a user at a position that from the clients perspective is incorrect. However, it can also be because some users have had SmartScore points transferred from OpenStudy.</p>
