(the “Company”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) regarding your use of our analytics software (“Fathom Analytics”) and other services available on our website(s): usefathom.com or app.usefathom.com (the “Website”) (collectively, “Services”).</p><p>You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking, checking or tapping a checkbox or a button to that effect on the Website, by completing the registration process on the Website or by using any of our Services.</p><p>BY USING THE WEBSITE OR BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT THE TERMS, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND AND COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY, FOUND AT USEFATHOM.COM/LEGAL/TERMS, INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.</p><p>By using this Website, you represent and warrant that you are the legal age of majority under applicable law to form a binding contract with us and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Website.</p><h2>Subscriptions</h2><p>The Services are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription") per our pricing, which can be found by visiting usefathom.com/pricing (“Fees”). You will be billed the Fees in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p><p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you or we cancel it pursuant to these Terms. You may cancel your Subscription’s auto-renewal through your online account management page on the Website. Cancellation occurs immediately.</p><p>A valid payment method, such as credit card, is required to process the payment of the applicable Fees for your Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you irrevocably authorize us to charge the applicable Fees for your Subscription and your use of our Services, in accordance with the applicable Billing Cycle, to that payment method.</p><p>You are responsible to ensure that all the Fees payable by you are paid on a timely basis. In the event you do not pay us the Fees on a timely basis, in accordance with these Terms, we reserve the right to suspend your account and restrict your use of our Services without prior notice to you. We further reserve the right to delete your account in the event your account remains suspended for 2 consecutive months. In the event of any account suspension or deletion, you acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any refunds of any amounts previously paid to us.</p><h2>Exceeding your pageview limit</h2><p>Each Subscription plan has a prescribed monthly maximum pageview allowance. A “pageview” is a website view or an event completion. If you exceed your prescribed pageview limit for 2 consecutive months, or you significantly exceed your pageview limit within the first month, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we will notify you asking you to upgrade your account. In the event you fail to upgrade your account within seven days of our request, we reserve the right to suspend your account and restrict your use of our Services anytime after the seventh day following our notice to you. We further reserve the right to delete your account in the event your account remains suspended for 2 consecutive months. In the event of any account suspension or deletion, you acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any refunds of any amounts previously paid to us.</p><h2>Fee Changes</h2><p>We in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Fees for the Subscriptions. We will provide you with at least 30 days notice (including by email) of any proposed changes to the Fees for your Subscription to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Thereafter, your continued use of the Services after the Fee change comes into effect constitutes your irrevocable and binding agreement to pay the modified Fees for the Subscriptions.</p><h2>Refunds</h2><p>All Fees paid by you to us are non-refundable, except if required by law.</p><h2>Accounts</h2><p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on the Website and your use of our Services.</p><p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions that occur on your account. We recommend that you use 2FA with your account.</p><p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p><h2>Intellectual Property</h2><p>You understand and agree that the Website and its entire contents, features, and functionality, including, but not limited to, all information, software, code, text, displays, graphics, photographs, video, audio, design, presentation, selection, and arrangement, are owned by us, our licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected in all forms by intellectual property laws including without limitation, copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and any other proprietary rights.
