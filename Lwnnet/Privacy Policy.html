<h1>LWN.net Privacy Statement</h1>
</div>
<div class="ArticleText">

LWN cares deeply about the privacy of its readers, and is committed to
doing everything it can to preserve that privacy.  This document describes
in detail the information we collect and how we manage it.  Please do not
hesitate to drop us a note at lwn@lwn.net if you have any questions.
<p>
This is version 1.7 of the LWN privacy policy, revised on May 22,
2018.

<h2>Who is collecting this data?</h2>

LWN.net is operated by Eklektix Inc., a corporation based in Boulder,
Colorado, USA.  All data collected as a part of the operation of LWN is
maintained and controlled by Eklektix.

<h2>What information we collect</h2>

The LWN.net server collects the usual information from your browser and
network connection: your IP address, browser, referrer link, etc.  This
information is used to generate statistics within LWN so that we know 
what our readers are interested in and where they came from.  Server logs
are rotated out after one month, and are not copied off the server; we do
not share this information with any other party.
<p>

If you create an account on LWN.net, we ask for your full name and an email
address so that we may contact you.  Possession of an LWN account enables
you to subscribe to LWN, set various customization options, and to post
comments on the site.  Of course, we have no control over information you
post in comments; you should not post anything you do not wish to have
disclosed to the world.
<p>
Beyond the information provided when the account is created, we also track
your subscription status and your last login time.
Account information is retained for as long as the account itself remains
open.  Comments are part of the public record and the Linux community's
collective history; they are retained indefinitely.
<p>
If you purchase an LWN subscription with a credit card, we must collect
some contact information and, of course, the card details.  That
information is posted directly to our credit card gateway; none of it
passes through or is stored on any LWN server.  Payment via PayPal
discloses the email address associated with the PayPal account to us; we do
not retain that information.
<p>
The creation of subscriber links is tracked, as is the number of hits on
each link created; this information is retained for a period of two
months.
<p>
All data collected directly by LWN is stored on our (cloud-based) servers;
currently those servers are all based in the United States.
<p>

<h2>How we use your information</h2>

Information provided by you is used internally at LWN so that we may
implement various site features,
understand how our readers are using the site and how we may improve the 
user experience.
<p>
With the following exceptions, we will not share your personal information 
with any third party.  Your private information is private, and we intend
to keep it that way.  The exceptions are:
<ul>
<li> Any information you post in a public location — such as comments —
     is necessarily public.
<p>
<li> Credit card and transaction information must be shared with our credit
     card processing company.  We must retain transaction information
     (dates, dollar amounts, and what was purchased)
     indefinitely for accounting and fiscal reporting purposes.  We may
     have to disclose this information to the government in the event of a
     tax audit; this has never occurred in LWN's history.
<p>
<li> If we are presented with a valid search warrant by a government
     agency, we will, in all likelihood, have to comply.  This has never
     occurred in LWN's history.
<p>
<li> Remotely-hosted advertising content and analytics data collection
     will cause your IP address, requested page URL, and any information
     supplied by your browser to be passed to third parties.  Note that
     subscribers at the Professional Hacker level and above can turn off
     advertising and analytics in the account customization area.
<p>
<li> If you are part of a group subscription to LWN, the designated
     administrator(s) for that group can access your account name, your
     full name, and the date you last logged into your account.
</ul>
<p>
We may use your email address to contact you in limited, important
situations.  We will not use your address to send you advertising
materials, for LWN or anybody else.  If you sign up for any of 
LWN's mailing lists, we will, of course, send you the content that is 
relevant to that list.  We will never subscribe you to a mailing list 
without an explicit request on your part.

<h2>Use of cookies</h2>
<p>
If you create and use an LWN account, the <tt>LWN_Session1</tt> cookie 
is needed to securely manage your sessions on the site.
<p>
Advertisers and analytics may also make use of cookies.  Accepting
third-party cookies is entirely up to you, of course.

<h2>Control over your data</h2>
<p>
If you have any concerns about our use of your data, to withdraw consent
for data collection, or to request deletion of specific data, please
contact us at lwn@lwn.net.
