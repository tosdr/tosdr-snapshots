Image encryption prevents anyone from tapping onto the phone line and eavesdrop the images.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>Virtual Private Network 3DES (2)</strong> - VPN is a technology that makes a secure tunnel for the transmission of data. It is usually used by large companies to transmit confidential data from one office to another. While each image is encrypted, this secure tunnel provides an extra security layer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>Secure Parent Account Application Process (8)</strong> - Every parent has to obtain a secret PIN from their nursery before being able to submit an application through our secure application process. The account is only activated after the application has been reviewed and approved by the nursery management. In this process, not even the nursery owner knows the parent's account password.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>Automatic Log-out functions (9)</strong> - To prohibit unauthorized access to the NurseryCam Parental Webcam from an unattended computer, each account automatically stops image updates and has timed log-outs after five minutes.</p>

        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>Full control over Room and Time Access (11)</strong> - Your nursery will limit individual parent's viewing access to only the room(s) his/her child is in (e.g. Bear Room and garden) and the time his/her child attends the nursery (e.g. Monday and Wednesday afternoons only). Plus, you can limit the maximum viewing time per day.</p>

        <br />

        <h3 class="heading4">5.1.4 Secure Central Server Protection</h3>

        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>Firewalls (5)</strong> - Firewalls are used to prevent unauthorised internet users from accessing NurseryCam servers. Each message entering or leaving the NurseryCam servers are examined and those that do not meet our specified security criteria are automatically blocked.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2"><strong>24 Hours Security Monitoring (12)</strong> - Our dedicated monitoring team operates 24/7 to ensure that the highest security standard is maintained at all times. An abused account would be suspended immediately and dealt by our security personnel directly.</p>
