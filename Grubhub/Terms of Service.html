As used in this Agreement, “you” means any visitor, user, or other person who accesses our Platform or Services, whether or not such person registered for an Account (as defined below). Unless otherwise agreed by Grubhub in a separate written agreement with you or your authorized representative, the Platform is made available solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p><p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH GRUBHUB, NO MATTER WHEN ARISING OR ASSERTED, THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND GRUBHUB EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

You may order food through the Platform to be delivered from particular merchants, including their authorized licensees and franchisees, or other purveyors of food in cities throughout the United States and other territories where Grubhub provides such Services (collectively, the “Merchants”).</p><p>Grubhub is not a restaurant or food preparation entity. The Merchants available on our Platform operate independently of Grubhub. Merchants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and safety and menu disclosure. Grubhub is not liable or responsible for Merchants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, Grubhub does not guarantee the quality of what the Merchants sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or engage another third-party delivery service. Grubhub does not independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by Merchants regarding their food, including, without limitation, any menu- or Merchant-level descriptors, disclosures, photographs or images displayed through the Platform reflecting the food prepared by the Merchants and/or delivered by Delivery Partners (defined below). By accessing the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Merchants are solely responsible for, and Grubhub shall not be liable or responsible for, the services provided to you by any Merchant or any subcontractor of any Merchant, nor shall Grubhub be responsible for any acts, omissions, errors or misrepresentations made by any Merchant or any subcontractor of any Merchant.</p><p>Grubhub is not a delivery company or a common carrier. Some deliveries are provided by Grubhub's network of independent delivery service providers (“Delivery Partners”). Delivery Partners are not actual agents, apparent agents, ostensible agents, or employees of Grubhub in any way. Rather, Delivery Partners have entered into agreements with Grubhub which require them to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, traffic laws, requirements of the applicable motor vehicle agency, and applicable insurance requirements. By accessing the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Delivery Partners are solely responsible for, and Grubhub shall not be liable or responsible for, the delivery services provided to you by any Delivery Partner or any subcontractors of Delivery Partners, or any acts, omissions, errors or misrepresentations made by any Delivery Partner.</p><h2 id="using-grubhub">USING GRUBHUB</h2><p>You may only create and hold one account on each of the separately branded properties on the Platforms (each, an “Account”) for your personal use. You may have another Account if you are using the Platform for business purposes, including as part of an enterprise Account, pursuant to a separate agreement with Grubhub. In consideration of the use of the Platform and the Services, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Grubhub, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.</p><p>The Platform may permit you to use the Services without an Account or without logging in to your Account (e.g. on our in-store kiosks, through our assisted phone ordering feature, or as a guest with our group order feature). If you use the Service in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information you provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your payment information, name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Platform, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement on your behalf prior to your using the Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Platform or otherwise access the Services if you are under the age of 16. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that entity, organization, or company. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if Grubhub has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we believe that you have breached this Agreement, Grubhub has the right to immediately block your current or future use of the Platform and/or the Services (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is terminated for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits, Perks (defined below) or other promotional offers, and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you.</p><p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Grubhub of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. Grubhub will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password.</p><h2 id="our-alcoholic-beverages-policy">OUR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES POLICY</h2><p>Some jurisdictions permit the ordering and delivery of alcoholic beverages. In such jurisdictions, if you place an order that includes any alcoholic beverage, you represent and warrant that you are at least 21 years of age. Upon delivery or pickup, as applicable, you shall present a government-issued identification card, evidencing your age, consistent with applicable legal requirements. The Delivery Partner may electronically scan the identification card of the individual receiving the order to confirm that the recipient is at least 21 years of age and the delivery may be completed. You also agree that our Delivery Partners may withhold delivery of the alcoholic beverages if you appear or the recipient of the delivery appears intoxicated when receiving delivery of such products. If you do not comply with these terms, you agree that the alcoholic beverage(s) will not be released to you, you may forfeit the cost of such beverages, and you may be responsible for restocking fees.</p><h2 id="payment-and-our-credit-policy">PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY</h2><p>Certain features of the Platform, including, without limitation, the placing or receipt of orders, may require you to make certain payments, including commissions or other fees. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Grubhub. Grubhub, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.</p><p>Grubhub will charge, and you authorize Grubhub to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any amounts with a credit card, Grubhub may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event Grubhub advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Platform (e.g., if your corporate account has a line of credit), Grubhub may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant Grubhub the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.</p><p>Please note, you are unable to complete checkout with only gift card information. In all events, you are required to provide another form of payment to submit an order, even if this payment method is not charged. Also, if you are a campus user and you opt to pay for a purchase with your stored-value card, on certain campuses, (i) Grubhub will charge such purchase to your stored-value card and will charge any applicable fees to either your credit card or other payment on file with us, and (ii) you agree that Grubhub may be unable to refund a purchase to your stored-value card and may, in its discretion, provide a refund through an alternative method.</p><p>Grubhub reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time, and further reserves the right to consolidate or otherwise incorporate fees and/or surcharges into the prices listed for Merchant food and beverage items. You understand that the prices for menu items displayed through the Services may differ from the prices offered or published by Merchants for the same menu items, whether offered by the Merchant directly or on third-party websites. You also understand that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the menu items are sold. Grubhub’s white label convenience menus source products from select third party providers, including existing Merchants on the Grubhub Platform. Prices may vary between the existing Merchant menu and the Grubhub white label convenience menu. For example, the same menu item may be available at both the existing merchant and Grubhub’s white label convenience, but the price on the existing merchant's menu may be higher than the price on Grubhub’s white label convenience menu.</p><p>For certain transactions, the subtotals shown at checkout are estimates that may be higher or lower than the total amount due. Regardless of the cause, Grubhub reserves the right to charge the final price after checkout, including without limitation all applicable transaction taxes. Grubhub may also, in its sole discretion, make Perks or other promotional offers with different features and different rates available to any or all of our users. Unless made available to you, these Perks and promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged. For more information on these offers, please see the “Perks” section below.</p><p>The provider of Services is set forth herein. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.</p><h2 id="our-materials-and-license-to-you">OUR MATERIALS AND LICENSE TO YOU</h2><p>With the exception of Your Content (defined below), the Platform and everything on it, including, without limitation, text, photos, videos, graphics and software, (collectively, the "Materials") is owned by or licensed to Grubhub.

Grubhub may monitor any and all use of the Platform, including, without limitation, interactions between our users; however, we are under no obligation to do so. We may manage the Platform in a manner intended to protect our property and rights and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Platform. If any of Your Content or conduct on our Platform violates our standards, or any other terms of this Agreement; or interferes with other peoples' enjoyment of the Materials or our Platform or Services; or is inappropriate in our judgment; we reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without notice to you, (i) to change, delete or remove, in part or in full, any of Your Content, (ii) to terminate or suspend access to any Interactive Areas or any other part of our Platform, and/or (iii) to terminate or suspend your Account; in each case, with or without notice.

Ratings and Reviews</p><p>The Platform and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (each, a “Rating”) and post reviews (each, a “Review”) of Merchants. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered Your Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by Grubhub, and do not represent the views of Grubhub or of any affiliate or partner of Grubhub.

Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Platform may be removed or excluded by us without notice.</p><h2 id="communications-text-messages">COMMUNICATIONS &amp; TEXT MESSAGES</h2><p>When you use the Services, or send emails, text messages, and other communications from your desktop or mobile device to us, you may be communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us or on our behalf electronically, such as e-mails, texts, mobile push notices, or notices and messages through the Services, and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You agree to keep your contact information, including email address, current. This subparagraph does not affect your statutory rights.</p><p>Your voluntary provision to Grubhub of your cell phone number represents your consent that Grubhub may contact you by telephone, SMS, or MMS messages at that phone number, and your consent to receiving such communications for transactional, operational, or informational purposes. When you provide your phone number to Grubhub, you warrant that you are the current subscriber or authorized user of the relevant account. You understand and agree that such messages may be sent using automated technology. You may unsubscribe from receiving text messages from Grubhub at any time. To revoke your consent to receiving SMS or MMS messages from Grubhub, you agree to follow the unsubscribe procedures described below.</p><p>When placing orders through the Platform, you may receive order status messages from Grubhub about each order. To unsubscribe from order-related messages, just reply "STOP" to the number sending the message. To resubscribe, text “START” to the same number from the phone number associated with your account. If you need assistance, text “HELP”. Please note that unsubscribing from one of the branded properties in our Platform will not automatically unsubscribe you from another separately branded property in our Platform. For example, if you unsubscribe from Grubhub order-related messages, you may still receive order-related messages when you place an order through Seamless, unless you also unsubscribe from Seamless order-related messages.</p><p>Additionally, you may receive messages from Grubhub following receipt of a completed order soliciting feedback and/or other information relating to the order. You may unsubscribe from all such feedback messages by replying "STOP" to the number sending the feedback messages. To resubscribe, text "START" to the number sending the feedback messages using the phone number associated with your account. Please note that unsubscribing from such feedback texts will not prevent you from receiving texts from Grubhub, the Merchant, or your delivery person regarding your order or its delivery unless you also text "STOP" to the number sending the order-related messages, and even in such event, you may still receive individual texts from the Merchant or your delivery person to enable successful delivery of your order.</p><p>You may also receive text messages in response to certain Customer Care requests. To unsubscribe from Customer Care messages, just reply to the message by texting “STOP” to the number sending the message.</p><p>If you unsubscribe from receiving text messages from Grubhub through the process described above, you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while Grubhub processes your request(s). If you change or deactivate the phone number you provided to Grubhub, you have an affirmative obligation to immediately update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you, and any new phone number(s) you attach to your Account may receive Grubhub’s standard SMS or MMS messages unless you also unsubscribe via the above procedures.</p><p>Standard data and message rates may apply for SMS and MMS alerts, whether you send or receive such messages. Please contact your mobile phone carrier for details. Your mobile phone carrier (e.g. T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc.) is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. If you require assistance, please call our Customer Care team at 1-877-585-7878.</p><h2 id="additional-terms-for-mobile-applications">ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h2><p>We may make available software to access Grubhub’s websites, technology platforms, and related online and mobile services via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”).

Therefore, for any Dispute that arises between you and Grubhub, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This includes first sending a written description of the Dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account to the following email address: <a href="mailto:disputeresolution@grubhub.com">disputeresolution@grubhub.com</a>. Your written description must be on an individual basis and also provide at least the following information: your name; a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute, including any transaction details; and the specific relief sought and how it was calculated. Your written description must be personally signed by you. For any Dispute that Grubhub raises, we will send our written description of the Dispute to the email address associated with your account.</p><p>You and Grubhub then agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This might include an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference between you and Grubhub if such a conference is requested by Grubhub. If such an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference takes place, it shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference. If either party is represented by counsel, that party's counsel may participate in the informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, but the party also must appear at and participate in the conference. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason the Dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of the complete written description of the Dispute, you and Grubhub agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.</p><p>To reiterate, this informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations based on a failure to comply with this Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. A party may raise non-compliance with this Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in court and/or in connection with the arbitration.</p><p>II. Mutual Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>You and Grubhub agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement or payments by or to Grubhub, or that in any way relate to your use of the Platform, the Materials, the Services, and/or other content on the Platform, your relationship with Grubhub, or any other dispute with Grubhub, (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) (each, a “Dispute”) shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration. Dispute shall have the broadest possible meaning. This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This Mutual Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, issues related to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement are for a court to decide. Also, each party retains the right to (1) elect (at any time prior to the appointment of an arbitrator) to have any claims heard in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, provided the proceeding remains in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction, and (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property rights. For clarity, this “Dispute Resolution” section does not alter, amend, or affect any of the rights or obligations of the parties to any Grubhub Delivery Partner Agreement.</p><p>ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE DISPUTE. RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND GRUBHUB ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><p>III. Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver.</p><p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND GRUBHUB OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS (EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW), AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING ANY DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.</p><p>THIS CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION, AND IF IT IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR DISPUTE, NEITHER YOU NOR GRUBHUB IS ENTITLED TO ARBITRATION OF SUCH CLAIM OR DISPUTE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER IS NOT ENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF OR A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ALL APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL), THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF MAY PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF.</p><p>IV. Arbitration Rules.</p><p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section, the AAA will administer the arbitration in accordance with either (A) the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, or (B) the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect if the matter involves a “consumer” agreement as defined by Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1 (together, the "Applicable AAA Rules"). The Applicable AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer an arbitration consistent with this “Dispute Resolution” section as written, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider that will administer the arbitration consistent with this “Dispute Resolution” section as written. If the parties cannot agree on an alternative arbitration provider, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration provider that will administer an arbitration consistent with this “Dispute Resolution” section as written.</p><p>V. Arbitration Process.</p><p>If after sixty (60) days the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure above is unsuccessful in resolving the parties’ dispute, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the Applicable AAA Rules. (The AAA provides applicable forms for Demands for Arbitration available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand_for_Arbitration_0.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand_for_Arbitration_0.pdf</a> (Commercial Arbitration Rules) and <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf</a> (Consumer Arbitration Rules), and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California residents only is available at <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf">https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf</a>.) If you initiate arbitration, you shall certify that you have complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure above and personally sign your Demand for Arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state or county in which you reside. The parties will first attempt to agree on an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within twenty-one (21) days of receiving the AAA’s list of eligible neutrals, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p>VI. Arbitration Location and Procedure.</p><p>Unless you and Grubhub otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Grubhub submit to the arbitrator, unless a party requests a hearing and the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Applicable AAA Rules. Subject to the Applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Unless otherwise prohibited by law or agreed by the parties, all arbitration proceedings and all related records will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Grubhub, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.</p><p>VII. Batch Arbitration.</p><p>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm or organization are submitted to AAA or another arbitration provider (if AAA is unavailable) against Grubhub, the arbitration provider shall (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) designate a single, different arbitrator for each batch (unless the parties agree otherwise); and (iii) provide for a single filing set of fees (for example, if AAA is the arbitration provider, one filing fee, case management fee, and arbitrator compensation fee) due per side per batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Grubhub and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of claims. This “Batch Arbitrations” provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Grubhub expressly reserves its right to raise unique defenses as to each claimant in connection with this process.</p><p>VIII. Arbitrator's Decision.</p><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator's award of damages and/or other relief must be consistent with section III above and also must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding only between the parties to the arbitration proceeding and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party.</p><p>Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration. The arbitrator shall apply the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after the arbitration award is entered. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of a claim or the relief sought in a Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for harassment or an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses in favor of a party.</p><p>IX. Fees.</p><p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and/or arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules (as modified by section VII above). If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Grubhub will reimburse as much of the filing, administration, and/or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive to you.</p><p>X. Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</p><p>Grubhub’s updates to this Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Mutual Arbitration Agreement if you previously agreed to an Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. Grubhub will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of the Arbitration Agreement in a prior version of the Agreement. If you create a Grubhub account for the first time on or after December 14, 2021, you may opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. To opt out, you must notify Grubhub in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Grubhub Account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to: <a href="mailto:disputeresolution@grubhub.com">disputeresolution@grubhub.com</a>. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with Grubhub or may enter into in the future with Grubhub.</p><p>XI. Changes.</p><p>Grubhub reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution" section. If Grubhub changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Platform or Services after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing Grubhub written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Grubhub, Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 111 West Washington Street, Suite 2100, Chicago, Illinois 60602, or by email from the email address associated with your account to: <a href="mailto:disputeresolution@grubhub.com">disputeresolution@grubhub.com</a>, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Grubhub in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).</p><h2 id="waiver-and-severability">WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</h2><p>Any waiver by Grubhub of any term of this Agreement must be in writing. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (see “Dispute Resolution” section III), if any portion of this Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, modified or replaced by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible. The remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.</p><h2 id="entire-agreement">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2><p>This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Grubhub in connection with the Platform and the Services hereunder, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Grubhub concerning the Platform, any orders placed through the Platform, and the Services hereunder.</p><h2 id="contact">CONTACT</h2><p>If you have any questions regarding this Agreement or the Platform, please visit our "Help" page for answers and our contact information.</p></div></div></div></div><dashi-imf-placement placement-id="PV4rSek1o6E9p7HnzNBpB"></dashi-imf-placement></div></div><footer class="dark-theme siteFooter-container" id="52RkDorUW4OAW8msE0iUoM"><style>.siteFooter {
