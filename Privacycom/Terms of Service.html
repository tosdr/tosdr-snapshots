By using any of the Services you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including terms that limit our liability (see Limitations of Liability and Damages) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Binding Individual Arbitration). You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), which become part of your agreement with us.</p><h2>1. Products, Registration, and Verification</h2><h6>Products</h6><p>The Privacy.com Services include tools to safely and easily shop while protecting your privacy from merchants and other companies that collect cardholder or other financial data.  We provide access to these tools via our web-based portal and mobile phone applications. Additionally, our financial services partners provide you with access to payment cards and other payment and banking services, for which separate terms may apply.</p><p>We are not a bank and do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. Banking services are provided by our applicable bank partner(s).</p><h6>Registration</h6><p>You must open an account with us (a “Privacy Account” or “Account”) to use the Services. During registration we will ask you for information, including your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and keep that information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Privacy Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted any access to the Privacy Account (including, but not limited to, any Privacy cards). We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the Privacy Account of any user who provides inaccurate or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with account registration requirements. </p><p>Privacy may request additional information from you at any time. For example, Privacy may ask you to present government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a business license, or other information. If you refuse any of these requests, your Privacy Account may be suspended or terminated.</p><p>Depending on the Privacy product or service you wish to use, to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires us to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who requests to use Services. What this means for you: When you open a Privacy Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you.</p><p>We may make inquiries that we consider appropriate and use third party services to help us verify your identity and determine if we should open, maintain, collect or close your account. We may also report the status, history and/or closure of your account to third-party services.</p><h2>2. Cashback, Promotions, and Referrals</h2><h6><strong>Privacy Credits</strong></h6><p>Your account may contain Privacy credits (“Privacy Credits”), which are cashback promotions that can be used for payment of an eligible purchase made with your Privacy account. Participants in Privacy cashback promotions may earn Privacy Credits on up to $4,500 of eligible monthly net purchases (i.e., generally based on purchase transaction amounts minus any credits or returns). Privacy may increase or decrease the amount of monthly transactions eligible for Privacy Credits at its sole discretion. </p><p>Certain Subscription Services may offer different Privacy Credit terms (including, but not limited to, the amount of transactions over a time period that are eligible for Privacy Credits) and can be found when signing up for the applicable Subscription Service.</p><p>Privacy may determine and change in its sole discretion which transactions are eligible for cashback Privacy Credits. Privacy may determine ineligibility based on specific transactions, categories of transactions, merchants, categories of merchants, or other aspects in our sole discretion. </p><p>Privacy Credits resulting from Privacy purchases during a calendar month will be automatically applied to your Privacy account generally within the first ten (10) business days of the next calendar month. However, the timing of when Privacy Credits are applied may vary based on specific terms of a promotion. </p><p>Unless expressly stated otherwise, unused Privacy Credits may expire after twelve months of account inactivity. Privacy Credits are not redeemable for cash, cannot be transferred, gifted, exchanged, or sold between users. If you close your Privacy Account, all purchases made during the calendar month that the Account was closed will not be eligible for the Privacy cashback promotion. We reserve the right to render your account ineligible for the cashback promotion in the event of any chargebacks, ACH bounces, ACH disputes, or suspicious activity associated with your Account.</p><p>In our sole discretion, we may deduct Privacy Credits from your account or make a debit entry to your connected funding source in order to make adjustments for returns, purchase cancellations or fraudulent activity. Any such adjustments, however, will be made in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Privacy policies and terms, and any and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. It is your responsibility to check your Account regularly to ensure that Privacy Credit has been properly credited and that the amount of Privacy Credits in your Account is accurate. If you believe that Privacy Credit has not been correctly credited to your account, you must contact Privacy Support within ninety (90) days of the transaction. Should you disagree with any adjustments made to your account or payments made to you, your sole remedy is to withdraw from the Program.</p><h6><strong>Promotions</strong></h6><p>In addition to Privacy Credits, Privacy may offer other promotions. Determination of Privacy Credit or other promotion eligibility, duration, and features (including, but not limited to, the maximum amount of credit earnable, if applicable) are at the sole discretion of Privacy. Privacy reserves the right to modify the application or aspects of a promotion (including, but not limited to, the rate or timing of Privacy Credits earned by any user pursuant to a promotion) at any time. Privacy reserves the right to verify and adjust credits or other promotion aspects at any time prior to or following credit to your Account or other application of the promotion. Your Privacy account must be, and must remain, active and in good standing, as determined by Privacy at its sole discretion, to receive Privacy Credits or participate in any promotion.</p><p>Privacy.com reserves the right to terminate any promotions at any time and to refuse or recover any promotion award for any reason, including, but not limited to, your breach of these General Terms.</p><h6><strong>Referral Programs</strong></h6><p>New and current Privacy users may be provided with a unique referral URL that permits the Privacy user (each a “Referrer Customer”) to refer acquaintances to Privacy. Referred customers (each, a “Referred Customer”) must register for Privacy using the unique URL provided by Privacy.</p><p>Subject to these terms and conditions, any Referrer Customer that refers an acquaintance to Privacy will receive up to $5 (or such other amount specified by Privacy) in Privacy account credit (“Referrer Bonus”) for every such referral when the Referred Customer successfully registers and makes a qualifying transaction with Privacy (the “Referral Offer”).</p><p>In addition, the Referred Customer will receive up to $5 (or such other amount specified by Privacy) (“Referred Bonus”) in Privacy Credit off their first purchase using Privacy’s Services after their successful registration with Privacy. </p><p>Determination of program eligibility and qualifying referrals are at the sole discretion of Privacy. Privacy reserves the right to verify and adjust referral credits at any time prior to or following application of credit. Your Privacy account must be active and in good standing, as determined by Privacy at its sole discretion, to receive the Referrer Bonus or Referred Bonus.</p><p>This Referral Offer is intended for Privacy customers only to refer their acquaintances to Privacy and should not be advertised, marketed or otherwise utilized for commercial purposes. This Referral Offer is a limited time offer and Privacy reserves the right to modify, suspend or cancel this Referral Offer at any time without notice.</p><h2>3.

If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York County, New York, or another mutually agreeable location. </p><p>The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. We will pay the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Privacy also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in state court in New York County, New York, or federal court for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Privacy, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to these General Terms, any Additional Terms, or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.</p><h6>Deadline to Initiate Disputes</h6><p>Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within 90 days after the cause of action accrues.</p><h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2><h6>Transaction Errors and Disputes</h6><p>Depending on the Privacy product or service used, there may be notification, timing, and other requirements if you believe there has been an error or wish to dispute a transaction. Refer to your applicable Additional Terms for the specific requirements that may apply.</p><h6>Privacy Preferred Merchant Program</h6><p>Privacy may offer a preferred merchant program (“Preferred Merchant Program”). In these programs Privacy would receive compensation for referring buyers to merchants and pass a portion of the compensation back to you as cashback. The terms, conditions, and participation eligibility requirements for Preferred Merchant Program are in Privacy’s sole discretion. Whether a purchase qualifies for the Preferred Merchant Program is in Privacy’s sole discretion.</p><h6>Conversion to US Dollars</h6><p>Transactions made in currencies other than U.S. Dollars will be converted by the network or card association that processes the transaction into U.S. Dollars. The card association may consider transactions occurring in U.S. territories to be an international transaction. Conversion to U.S. Dollars may occur on a date other than the date of the transaction, thus the actual conversion rate may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction. You agree to pay the converted amount plus any applicable conversion charges made by the network or card association that processes the transaction.</p><h6>Governing Law</h6><p>These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by New York law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.</p><h6>Assignment</h6><p>These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.</p><h6>Abusive or Excessive Activity</h6><p>If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive number of false, misleading, or abusive transactions or other disputes or errors , we may establish additional conditions governing your Privacy Account, including terminating or suspending the Services.</p><h6>Allowed Users</h6><p>If you allow another person (an “Authorized User”) to use any Privacy Services under your Account, you are responsible and liable for all transactions, withdrawals, deposits, fees, and other liabilities that arise out of such use, even if it exceeds the authorization granted. You agree to make sure each Authorized User agrees to comply with these General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms prior to using the applicable Privacy Services.</p><h6>Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites</h6><p>You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Privacy (“Third Party Services”). If you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services. We are not responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services. The Services may contain links to third party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Privacy. Such third party websites are not governed by these General Terms. You access any such website at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to that website’s own terms, rules and policies.</p><h6>Other Provisions</h6><p>These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Privacy regarding the Services. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Privacy agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p><h6>Revisions, Disclosures and Notices</h6><p>We may amend the General Terms, any Additional Terms, or our Policies, at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website or communicating it to you through the Services (each a “Revised Version”). The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted but will not apply retroactively. Your continued use of the Services after the posting (or communication, as applicable) of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version. Any Dispute that arose before the changes will be governed by the General Terms, Additional Terms or Policies in place when the Dispute arose.</p><p>You are responsible for providing Privacy with your most current email address. In the event that the last email address you provided to Privacy is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering you notices required/permitted under these Terms, Privacy’s dispatch of the email containing such notice will constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Privacy at the following address: </p><p>Lithic, Inc.
