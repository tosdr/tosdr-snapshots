Advertisements appearing on the InterPals.net
Sites, Product or Services may be delivered to users by InterPals.net or
one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may
set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your
computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way,
ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are
using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads
are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver
targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to
you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by InterPals.net and
does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
<p>InterPals.net
does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers.
InterPals.net may share general demographic information (such as aggregated
statistics about members' interests and occupations) and
non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP
addresses) with advertisers and partners. InterPals.net does not
give advertisers access to your individual personal account information.
However, by selecting, interacting with or viewing an ad you are
consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the
assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the
ad.</p>
<p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address
email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other
Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to
know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br/>InterPals.net may revise, modify or update this policy. We may notify you
about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by
sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your
particular InterPals.net account or by placing a prominent notice on our
site. You are encouraged to check this policy frequently for any changes
as your continued use of the InterPals service indicates your consent to
such changes.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong><br/>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your information, we take reasonable measures to secure it on
our systems.</p>
<p>If InterPals.net learns of a security systems breach we
may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
appropriate protective steps. By using InterPals or providing personal
information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues
relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post
a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If
this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the
applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email
address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on
where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a
security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security
breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice)
you should notify us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbbbb9a2bdaaa8b28b82a5bfaeb99baaa7b8e5a5aebf"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e9999b809f888a90a9a0879d8c9bb988859ac7878c9d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Changing your
Preferences and Personal Information </strong><br/>

information with InterPals at any time. Most personal information you may
provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents are
considering whether to permit their children to use Interpals, we do not
condition a child's participation based upon their provision of any more
personal information than is necessary to operate those sites, products and
services.
</p>
<p>You can delete your applicable account by visiting the

used for authentication purposes and for notifications.
<br/><br/>
In compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR),
at a user's request, Interpals will delete all user data from its servers. To request data
deletion, a user must send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#43303633332c3137032a2d37263133222f306d2d2637"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e0939590908f9294a0898e94859290818c93ce8e8594">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
requesting "Permanent data deletion" and including the username of the profile in question. If the
email is received from an email address other than the one used to register the account, supplemental
identity verification will be required.
</p>
<p>You can delete your applicable account by visiting the
applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some personal
information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records
to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document
compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
