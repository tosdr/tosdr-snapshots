<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>By accepting the following Terms and Conditions of Use for goSupermodel, you accept terms such as that goSupermodel may not be used for commercial purposes; that goSupermodel has an unlimited right to use and further develop the material which you or others create and upload or submit to goSupermodel; that you are responsible for ensuring that this material does not violate the rights of others; and that your access, profile and model may be deleted, closed or blocked without entitling you to raise any claims against goSupermodel if you violate these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT! You are under no circumstances allowed to use goSupermodel if you are below the age of 13 (thirteen). If we find out that you are below this age your profile, model and all content and virtual items connected to it will be deleted immediately.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, your parents or guardian must accept these Terms and Conditions of Use before you may use goSupermodel. In this case, you must ask your parents to review this document with you</p>

<p>Please read the Terms and Conditions of Use carefully before you accept them and before you create a model on goSupermodel.</p>

<h2>2. Introduction</h2>
<h3>2.1</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the use of goSupermodel, which you can access via www.gosupermodel.com, and associated services, jointly referred to as "goSupermodel" in the following.</p>
<h3>2.2</h3>
<p>You may not set up a profile on goSupermodel until you have accepted these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<p>If you are not of full age or not legally competent, your parents or your legal guardian must accept these Terms and Conditions of Use before you can set up a profile. As a parent or guardian of a goSupermodel user, you must read these Terms and Conditions of Use together with the minor, as you are responsible for the minor's use of goSupermodel, unless otherwise stipulated in mandatory rules of law.</p>

<h2>3. Using goSupermodel</h2>
<h3>3.1 Behaviour</h3>
<p>3.1.1	All communication conducted on goSupermodel - such as via chat, forum, blog, clubs and public messages - must be according to the rules. In order to keep goSupermodel safe, we require all communication to be conducted in English only. This rule applies to both written text and text within images.</p>
<p>3.1.2	You may not bully or harass other people on goSupermodel. You may not write anything resembling cybersex or which could be perceived as sexual in any other way, taking part in making racist statements or discriminatory statements against others due to their religion, sexuality etc., or in any other way exhibit threatening, violent, offensive or insulting behaviour to other people.</p>
<p>3.1.3	On goSupermodel, you may not write anything derogatory about other people, not even if the individuals in question do not use goSupermodel.</p>
<h3>3.2 Non-commercial use</h3>
<p>You are not allowed to use goSupermodel for commercial purposes. For this reason, you may not market products if you have an interest in their sales or have any other reason to wish to promote them. This means, for instance, that the name of your model may not refer to a product or company. In addition, you are not permitted to use materials from goSupermodel for developing services or websites which compete with goSupermodel or for other commercial purposes.</p>
<h3>3.3 Do not use other users' models</h3>
<p>You are not permitted to log onto another person's model, not even if have been granted permission to do so by the person in question.</p>

<h2>4. Profile</h2>
<h3>4.1 Model name</h3>
<p>4.1.1	The name of your model must not be offensive or insulting to other people.</p>
<p>4.1.2	You should not impersonate other people.</p>
<h3>4.2 Password</h3>
<p>You should choose a good, secure password, preferably one that you donâ€™t use anywhere else but is easy for you to remember, is at least 8 characters long, and is hard for others to guess. You must never disclose your password. goSupermodel will never ask for your password, and if you receive any enquiries to do so, they will be fake</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<h3>5.1</h3>
<p>You may state your real name, address, phone number or similar personal data at your own risk, and by doing so you agree to having this information saved by goSupermodel.</p>
<h3>5.2</h3>
<p>goSupermodel encourages you to read more about online security under <a href="http://www.gosupermodel.com/support/safety.jsp">goSupermodel safety</a> or on <a href="http://www.childnet.com/" target=_blank>www.childnet.com</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Rights</h2>
<h3>6.1</h3>
<p>goSupermodel possesses the intellectual property rights to all material on goSupermodel, including texts, software, pictures, films, audio files, graphics and music. For this reason, you must never use this material unless you are doing this as part of ordinary use of goSupermodel or if it is otherwise permitted according to these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<h3>6.2</h3>
<p>Section 6.1 above notwithstanding, you are permitted to upload material from goSupermodel to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the like if you are otherwise permitted to do this, and otherwise to use the material for private purposes, provided that this material does not appear to have been made available by goSupermodel. However, you may under no circumstances use material from websites which are in contravention with Danish law, pages with erotic/pornographic content or other sites where it is apparent that the site is intended to harm goSupermodel, and the use of all material must comply with clause 3 at any time. If you upload material from goSupermodel to the Internet, you must link to www.gosupermodel.com.</p>
<h3>6.3</h3>
<p>If you or other persons create and upload or submit material to goSupermodel, such as by designing clothing or otherwise, you give goSupermodel a free, irrevocable and unlimited right to use this material, including to modify and further develop this material and to make it available to other users in return for payment or free of charge, or to distribute it to third parties. The exception to this is any uploaded photograph of a personal nature. goSupermodel will never use such photographs for commercial purposes.</p>
<h3>6.4</h3>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that any material you upload or otherwise submit to goSupermodel does not violate the rights of anyone else.</p>

<h2>7. Buying services on goSupermodel</h2>
<h3>7.1 VIP</h3>
<p>7.1.1	By purchasing a VIP, you receive an amount of virtual currency depending on what product you buy, which is made available to you right away. In addition, you receive one shot in the VIP pinball for every day of purchased VIP period. If you do not log in to the site on a specific day, the VIP pinball shot will be saved for you. However, only seven shots can be saved at any time.</p>
<p>VIP also gives you a range of additional benefits that may change over time.</p>
<h3>7.2 Virtual monetary standards</h3>
<p>7.2.1	There are two virtual monetary standards on goSupermodel: goMoney and Diamonds</p>
<p>7.2.1.1 goMoney can be used to buy certain virtual items and other services. goMoney can be earned and won on goSupermodel, but goMoney can also be received by buying a VIP.</p>
<p>7.2.1.2 Diamonds can be used to buy certain exclusive virtual items and other services that cannot be bought with goMoney.</p>	
<h3>7.3 Loss of services acquired on goSupermodel</h3>
<p>7.3.1	If your profile and model is deleted by you or another individual to whom you have given access to your profile and model, all content and services relating to your profile and model will be lost, including your goMoney, Diamonds and VIP, if relevant. An exception to this rule may be made, but only if goSupermodel assesses that the exception involves a unique case where this would be reasonable.</p>
<p>7.3.2	In the event your profile and model are deleted by goSupermodel because you have violated these Terms and Conditions of Use, all content and services will also be lost, and you may not claim the return of services or content nor claim a refund of the money you paid to goSupermodel to buy a VIP.</p>

<h2>8. Compensation</h2>
<h3>8.1</h3>
<p>All use of goSupermodel is done at your own expense and responsibility. goSupermodel is not liable for any loss that you, as a user, may suffer as a result of your use of goSupermodel, unless otherwise stipulated in mandatory rules of law.</p>
<h3>8.2</h3>
<p>goSupermodel's total liability in damages vis-Ã -vis a user or any other party may not exceed DKK 5,000 under any circumstances.</p>
<h3>8.3</h3>
<p>If goSupermodel or a third party incurs a loss arising from your violation of these Terms and Conditions of Use or from your misuse of goSupermodel, you will be liable in damages for this loss. This also applies to indirect loss and to the costs of expert advice, lawyer fees, etc. If you are not legally competent, your parents or guardian will be held liable to the maximum possible extent.</p>

<h2>10. Modifications</h2>
<h3>10.1</h3>
<p>goSupermodel reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions of Use at any time and without notice.

<h3>11.1</h3>

<h3>11.2</h3>
<p>goSupermodel is also entitled to terminate your access to and/or use of goSupermodel.

In this situation, you risk losing your profile and model, including all contents, services and VIP (if relevant), in connection with this.</p>
