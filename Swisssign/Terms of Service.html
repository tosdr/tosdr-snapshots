<h3><strong>12.&nbsp;Use of third parties</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN may engage third parties at any time to provide its services.</p>
<h3><strong>13.&nbsp;Warranty</strong></h3>
<p>The CUSTOMER shall, upon their receipt by the SUBSCRIBER, arrange for the inspection of the material supplied, including in particular the certificates, signatures and time stamps issued, in accordance with the relevant subscriber terms, and shall promptly notify any defects or incorrect and/or incomplete information (within a maximum of 7 business days), but in any event before certificates are used for the first time in a communication with third parties.</p>

<h3><strong>14. Liability</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall be liable to the Customer for all loss or damage caused by it unless it proves that it was not at fault. Liability for carelessness is excluded. The <a href="/en/support/repository.html">CP/CPS</a> liability regulations shall apply in relation to third parties.</p>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall not be liable for proper operation of third party systems, such as the internet, nor for the systems and software used by the CUSTOMER.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER and the SUBSCRIBER shall be liable to SWISSSIGN for loss or damage which is in any way attributable to the non-performance or inadequate performance of its contractual obligations unless it demonstrates that it is not at fault.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER undertakes to indemnify SWISSSIGN in respect of all third party claims resulting from the non-contractual or illegal use or misuse of the certificate service by the CUSTOMER and/or SUBSCRIBER. The indemnification includes the obligation to fully indemnify SWISSSIGN in respect of legal defence costs (e.g. court and legal costs). This, however, applies only if SWISSSIGN informs the CUSTOMER of the assertion of any third party claims, does not accept claims without the approval of the CUSTOMER and decides to delegate legal defence of the claims to the CUSTOMER.</p>
<p>Each party shall be liable for the conduct of those assisting them, and of any third parties who are engaged (e.g. subcontractors, suppliers) in the same way as they are for their own staff.</p>

The parties shall not under any circumstances be liable, in particular, for indirect losses, consequential loss or damage, data loss, additional expense or third party claims, lost profit or unachieved savings or for loss or damage due to late delivery or performance.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER is aware of the statutory liability of the holder of a signing key pursuant to Art. 59a of the Swiss Code of Obligations.</p>
<h3><strong>15.&nbsp;Data protection</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN undertakes to comply with the provisions of Swiss data protection legislation. The Customer for its part undertakes to comply with the local data protection regulations that apply to it.</p>
<p>The data collected during performance of the service, in particular personal information, may only be used for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for performing and implementing the certificate service. Using it for other purposes or passing it to third parties is strictly prohibited. There is still an option to pass it to third parties who are engaged to provide the service.</p>
<p>The data which is needed to provide the service shall be saved by SWISSSIGN and treated as confidential. The very latest in security technology shall be used to protect data from unauthorised processing or unauthorised access.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the statutory regulations, SWISSSIGN must keep all certificate holder data, documentation and audit information for a minimum period of 11 years after a certificate ends.</p>
<p>The data protection level in Switzerland has been confirmed by the European Commission as adequate. The requirement for the lawful transmission of data from member states of the European Union to Switzerland, namely that there must be an adequate level of data protection in the location in the third party country where the data is received, has consequently been met.</p>
<p>In addition, when an order is made in the web shop, the CUSTOMER states his agreement that SWISSSIGN can use all registration and usage data for market research and advertising purposes (e.g. as a reference). SWISSSIGN may compare such data in anonymised form with user information of third parties and/or develop user statistics and notify third parties of these statistics.</p>
<h3><strong>16.&nbsp;Confidentiality</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN, CUSTOMERS and any partners shall treat in confidence all facts and information that are not in the public domain or generally accessible (including in particular price lists). In the event of doubt, all facts and information shall be treated as confidential. The parties undertake to take all financially reasonable precautions that are technically and organizationally possible to ensure that confidential facts and information are protected effectively against access by or disclosure to unauthorized persons.</p>
<p>The duty of confidentiality exists even before a certificate service is ordered and shall continue to apply after the contractual relationship ends. The duty of confidentiality is not breached by the disclosure of confidential information within the same group or to third parties engaged to provide services. The parties shall impose on their employees and any other persons helping them the duties stated in the previous clause.</p>
<h3><strong>17. No partnership</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN and the CUSTOMER expressly declare that they have not constituted a partnership within the meaning of Article 530 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or established any other corporate relationship. Each party shall refrain from creating the impression with third parties that it is in partnership with the other party.</p>
<p>Cooperation between the parties shall be directed exclusively at the provision of services for remuneration under the terms of individual exchange contracts.</p>
<p>The parties do not have any common organisation, infrastructure or funds and are not pursuing a common purpose. The parties are separate undertakings independent of each other and operate as such on the market. The parties are not subject to any duty to pay contributions or additional contributions of any kind. There shall be no participation in profits or losses. Each party shall bear its own costs and risks. Neither party shall be entitled to act on behalf of the other party.</p>
<h3><strong>18.&nbsp;Assignment and transfer of rights and duties</strong></h3>
<p>The CUSTOMER may not assign or pledge its claims against SWISSSIGN without the written approval of SWISSSIGN.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER shall not be entitled to assign or transfer the rights and duties created under this contract.</p>
<h3><strong>19.&nbsp;Severability</strong></h3>
<p>In the event that any of the provisions of these GTC prove to be invalid or unlawful, this shall not affect the validity of the contract. In that event, the provision concerned shall be replaced by a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the original one in financial terms.</p>
<h3><strong>20.&nbsp;Amendment of GTC</strong></h3>
<p>SWISSSIGN reserves the right to amend the GTC at any time. Before it comes into effect, the relevant new version shall be published in good time on the website <a href="/en/agb-swisssign.html">https://www.swisssign.com/en/agb-swisssign</a>&nbsp;and communicated through the system status page: <a href="/en/support/systemstatus.html">https://www.swisssign.com/de/systemstatus</a>.</p>
<p>The amended GTC shall be deemed to have been approved unless objected to in writing by the CUSTOMER within one month of the time it becomes aware of them. An objection shall be construed as termination of the contract and shall result automatically in its dissolution.</p>
<h3><strong>21.&nbsp;Applicable law and jurisdiction</strong></h3>
<p>Swiss law shall apply exclusively. The provisions of the United Nations Convention of 11 April 1980s on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (&quot;CISG&quot;) shall not apply.<br />
The exclusive place of jurisdiction shall be Zurich, Switzerland. If the CUSTOMER has a foreign domicile or place of business, Zurich shall be deemed to be the place of enforcement and to have exclusive jurisdiction for all proceedings.</p>
<h3><strong>Annex A: Special Terms and Conditions concerning contract term, pricing and request terms, payment terms for contract services<br />
(&ldquo;Special Terms and Conditions &ndash; Contract Services&rdquo;)</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li>Managed PKI services</li>
<li>Time stamp services</li>
<li>Signing services</li>
<li>Special certificate services</li>
</ol>
<p>It does not apply to individual certificates in the web shop.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Term and termination of contract, effect of termination, extension of contract</strong></h4>
<p>Annual billing for chargeable provision of the certificate services shall commence (&ldquo;initial contract term&rdquo;) on the first day of the month after the certificate service order has been confirmed (&ldquo;contract start date but at least 5 days after the contract start date. Any kind of use prior to the start of the initial contract term shall be at the CUSTOMER&rsquo;s own risk.</p>
<p>The initial contract term shall be the one specified in the order.</p>
<p>Unless it is terminated at least three months prior to the end of the initial contract period or further contract period, the contract shall be automatically renewed for a further contract period of one year and for the same order and request volume, unless this has been reduced in advance. Unless otherwise agreed, a change order will be always based on the most recent contract terms and conditions. Where there is a change order any loyalty discount parameters of the initial contract term can be re-entered.</p>
<p>The contract may be terminated by either party in writing subject to giving notice of 3 months before the end of the initial contract term or renewed contract term.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the contract the possibility of accessing the certificate service shall lapse. Active certificates shall be revoked.</p>
<p>The above shall be without prejudice to the right of both parties to immediate termination for good cause. The &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; requirement shall be deemed to be met in particular by:</p>
<ul>
<li>the occurrence of events or circumstances that make it unreasonable for the terminating party to continue the contractual relationship;</li>
<li>a breach of the duties specified in this contract;</li>
<li>if SWISSSIGN is no longer able on legal grounds to comply with its duties under this contract;</li>
<li>the publication of official notice of the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings or the grant of a debt restructuring moratorium in relation to one of the parties;</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice of termination shall always be made in writing.</p>
<h4><strong>3.&nbsp;Use of order volume</strong></h4>
<p>Certificate service products or transactions may be purchased for a contract term of one or more years and up to a specified order volume subject to advance payment by the SUBSCRIBERS. The order volume is shown in the order sheet or the order form of the web shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the order volume has been used up, certificate products may be reordered at any time. The volume that is reordered shall be aggregated at the time the reorder is placed with the existing order volume. The resulting order volume shall be the basis for the new price and shall be immediately charged on a pro rata basis until the end of the annual service period. It will be automatically used as the basis for the billing for the coming contract year. The existing order volume must therefore be taken into account in the order. Repayment of unexploited order volume is excluded.</p>
<p>The volume may be reduced at any time by the CUSTOMER up until 30 days prior to the start of the new contract year.</p>
<p>The minimum order volume is shown in the order sheet or the order form in the web shop.</p>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Payment terms</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Due dates of payments</strong></h5>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the advance payment shall be due and payable upon receipt of the annual invoice from SWISSSIGN. In case of a reorder, the difference between the reorder and previous annual payment or computed inventory value shall be billed during the year for each full month after the reorder until the start of the new contract year on a pro rata basis of 1/12 for each month after the expiry of the contract year.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Overruns of order volume</strong></h4>
<p>Certificate services are not subject to any technical limitation as to the quantity requested. The CUSTOMER may thus exceed the order volume at any time, as required. SWISSSIGN will regularly check compliance of the order volume for the previous contract year. In the event that the order volume is exceeded, the difference between the order volume and the actual volume at the end of the billing year that has ended shall be charged in addition for the contract year just ended. Unless the CUSTOMER objects, the order volume which currently exists at the end of the contract year shall be automatically billed for the subsequent contract year. The order volume is calculated as shown in the Special Terms and Conditions - Certificate service.</p>
<h4><strong>6.&nbsp; Subsequent changes</strong></h4>
<p>Change orders placed after a binding order has been made shall attract the change and cancellation fees specified in the change order form or in a separate offer. This shall include all parameters not included in the original set up. A maximum number of parameters can be defined for the original setup, as shown in the order.</p>
<p>Where these are available, the corresponding current change request forms published in the web shop shall always be used for the changes in parameters. Prices for changes are based on the <a href="/en/dam/jcr:fc50d715-b609-4aa5-ab64-cb131521786d/PriceList_EN.pdf">price list</a>&nbsp;stored in the web shop as not otherwise agreed.</p>
<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;Revocation of certificates, time stamps and signatures</strong></h4>
<p>Revoked certificates, time stamps and signatures can no longer be actively used and are no longer part of the order volume.</p>
<h4><strong>8.&nbsp;Use as reference</strong></h4>
<p>SWISSSIGN may use the CUSTOMER as a reference for other (potential) customers on its website, in print materials and presentations. The reference includes the name of the CUSTOMER, its logo, the period and the scope of the related service. The CUSTOMER can expressly contradict the reference nomination when placing the order.</p>
<h3><strong>Annex B: Special Terms and Conditions - Managed PKI Services</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1.&nbsp;Scope</strong></h4>
<p>In a Managed PKI service, SWISSSIGN outsources part of its registration activity to an external registration authority. The external registration authority may in the setup defined by SWISSSIGN independently approve certificate requests and thereby trigger the issuance of certificates. The scope of a Managed PKI service is described on the web page and in the Registration Authority Delegation Policy. These provisions apply to Customers who obtain a Managed PKI service from SWISSSIGN including an external registration authority.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authorit</strong></h4>
<p>In the Managed PKI service, the external registration authority signs what is called the &ldquo;Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority&rdquo; which describes the Managed PKI service and stipulates the duties and responsibilities in running an external registration authority.</p>
<h4><strong>3.&nbsp;Order</strong></h4>
<p>The Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority of the external registration authority and other necessary annexes must be completely, correctly and validly signed by SWISSSIGN and submitted simultaneously with the order by the CUSTOMER. The Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority specifies the organisation and setup parameters for which the Managed PKI is set up.</p>
<p>The external registration authority may have additional organisations and their domains activated by submitting an additional Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority per organization. These organizations must fill out the necessary Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority and sign it validly, duly accompanied by the related annexes. The CUSTOMER shall always use the current template of the Acceptance Declaration of the Delegation of the Registration Authority form, which SWISSSIGN provides at&nbsp;<a href="/en/certificates/managed-pki.html">www.swisssign.com/en/certificates/managed-pki</a>.</p>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall be entitled to refuse orders without stating reasons.</p>
<p>The CUSTOMER may order the relevant code signing, SSL and personal ID certificates (without hardware based certificates) offered for sale in the SWISSSIGN online shop (<a href="/en/">www.swisssign.com</a>) in relation to the Managed PKI Services.</p>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Managed PKI order volume</strong></h4>
<p>The order volume of the Managed PKI service is calculated based on the expected total number of certificates requested and/or used during a contract year multiplied by the contractually stipulated annual individual price of a certificate. Each type of certificate shall have an annual certificate price, irrespective of the duration of the certificate. By purchasing the order volume, the CUSTOMER is entitled to request through the SUBSCRIBER any number of certificates up to the amount of said volume, with a term set by it, or to actively use a pre-existing certificate for a further year. The right shall lapse after the expiry of the prepaid contract year and must then be correspondingly extended by renewing the order volume in the next contract year. The certificate holder is the owner of the certificates.</p>
<p>In the Managed PKI order volume, any number of certificates can be received and used provided the total number of certificates actually used in parallel multiplied by the relevant annual individual price of the certificate type does not exceed the aggregate order volume.</p>
<p>The actual use of a certificate is calculated based on the duration of usage of the certificate during the contract year. If a certificate, for example, has only been used for half a year, the actual number of certificates relating to it is 0.5, whilst if a certificate has been used for one year, the figure is 1. The annual calculation shall be based on the duration of usage in days based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>The annual individual certificate price shall be paid for a certificate for each &ldquo;subject&rdquo; for which the certificate is issued. Copies of this certificate may be used on multiple devices at no additional cost.</p>
<h4><strong>5.&nbsp;Overrun of order volume</strong></h4>
<p>SWISSSIGN will regularly check the number of used, issued and valid certificates for the previous year. If the order volume calculated by the actual number of certificates being used in parallel exceeds the order volume, the difference in order volume can promptly be added to the charge for the current contract year in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Annex A, section 5.</p>
<h3><strong>Annex C: Special Terms and Conditions &ndash; Time Stamp Services</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1.&nbsp;Scope</strong></h4>
<p>In a time stamp service, SWISSSIGN shall provide the SUBSCRIBERS of the service with time stamps via an interface. These provisions shall apply to CUSTOMERS who receive a time stamp service from SWISSSIGN.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Order</strong></h4>
<p>Where the CUSTOMER wishes to use the time stamp service on a limited basis, ordering by means of an order sheet or order form in accordance with GTC, main section, paragraph 2b) shall not apply.</p>
<p>In this case the CUSTOMER may receive through its SUBSCRIBERs a maximum of 10 time stamps per day. Only CUSTOMERS who are themselves CUSTOMERS of SWISSSIGN or are in possession of a valid SWISSSIGN certificate may receive the cost-free time stamp. Evidence of this must be provided upon request.</p>
<h4><strong>3.&nbsp;Time stamp order volume</strong></h4>
<p>The order volume for the time stamp service shall be calculated based on the total number of expected time stamp requests in a year. A time stamp request here is a one-time call up of the time stamp service interface and the receipt of a time stamp through the SUBSCRIBER. The order volume may be only used during the pre-paid contract year and shall thereafter be invalid.</p>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Overrun of order volume</strong></h4>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall regularly check the number of time stamp requests made. If the quantity of requested time stamps is higher than the order volume of requests, there is an overrun of the order volume. The excess number of time stamps received shall then be added to the charge in accordance with Annex A, paragraph 5.</p>
<h3><strong>Annex D: Special Terms and Conditions - Signing Services</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1.&nbsp;Scope</strong></h4>
<p>In a signing service, SWISSSIGN provides the SUBSCRIBERS of a CUSTOMER with signatures via a cost-free interface. These provisions apply to CUSTOMERS who receive a signing service from SWISSSIGN.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Order</strong></h4>
<p>For the signing service a signing certificate of SWISSSIGN (standard) or a signing service created for the CUSTOMER (optional) can be used. The type of certificate is stipulated when the order is placed.</p>
<h4><strong>3.&nbsp;Client signing software</strong></h4>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall provide the signing service through an interface specified in the order sheet. A PDF document is accordingly signed in this process, although only the document hash code is transmitted. A licence for a client signing software package and/or library which makes use of said interface is not part of the service. It is the responsibility of the CUSTOMER to obtain this.</p>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Order volume and overrun of order volume</strong></h4>
<p>The order volume of signing requests shall be calculated based on the total number of expected signing requests in one year. A request here is a one-time call up of the time stamp service interface and the receipt of a signing service through the SUBSCRIBER and the receipt of a signature. The order volume may be only used during the pre-paid contract year and shall thereafter be invalid.</p>
<p>SWISSSIGN shall regularly check the number of signing requests made. If the quantity of requested signatures is higher than the order volume of requests, there is an overrun of the order volume. SWISSSIGN shall log each signature with time stamp, signing request ID and reference to the relevant certificate of the CUSTOMER. These logs shall also be provided to the CUSTOMER for billing and audit purposes if requested. Log files shall be kept for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>The excess number of signatures shall be added to the charge in accordance with the GTCs, Annex A, section 5. Unless the CUSTOMER objects, the volume of signatures received which is determined at the end of the contract year just ended shall be automatically set and billed as the order volume for the subsequent contract year.</p>
