Overview and Scope</h2><p>Company has released a decentralized, open-source platform (the "Platform") for advertising, contributions to publishers, and other attention-based services in connection with the Brave browser. People who use the Brave browser may activate the Platform's rewards feature ("Brave Rewards") for making optional contributions in Basic Attention Tokens ("BAT") to publishers and for earning BAT for viewing or interacting with advertisements.</p><p>These Terms govern the services (the "Services") that Company makes available to publishers who register for a publisher account with Company ("Brave Verified Publishers"), including the ability to receive BAT contributions and obtain related services through the Platform.</p><h2 id="2-eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2><p>In order to access and use our Services, you must</p><ul><li>(a) be at least 18 years of age and have the capacity to enter into a legally binding agreement,</li><li>(b) comply with all the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms,</li><li>(c) register for a Publisher Account in accordance with Section 3, which requires you to create an ERC20-compatible Ethereum wallet address ("<em>Publisher Wallet</em>") with one of the third-party wallet providers approved by Brave (a "<em>Custodian</em>"), and complete all required verification steps with the Custodian, and</li><li>(d) maintain your Publisher Wallet in good standing with the Custodian.</li></ul><p>Custodians that have been approved by Brave to provide Publisher Wallets include bitFlyer, Inc ("<em>bitFlyer</em>")., Gemini Trust Company, LLC ("<em>Gemini</em>"), and Uphold, Inc.

Publisher Account and Wallet</h2><p>To register for a Publisher Account, you will need to access our publisher registration webpage and provide us your name, email address, and the URL at which your publisher content is located ("<em>Publisher URL</em>"). Your phone number, name, email address, Publisher URL and Publisher Wallet address are your "<em>Account Information</em>", and are subject to additional terms and conditions set forth in Section 7.</p><p>We will send a message to the email address you provide with steps</p><ul><li>(a) designed to confirm that you control your Publisher URL and</li><li>(b) for creating a Publisher Wallet with a Custodian for the purpose of receiving contributions through Brave Rewards.</li></ul><p>As part of creating your Publisher Wallet, you must authorize your Custodian to provide us your Publisher Wallet address. You agree to comply with the Custodian's Terms and Conditions in connection with your use of the Publisher Wallet (which are available at: for Uphold, <a href="https://uphold.com/en/legal/membership-agreement">https://uphold.com/en/legal/membership-agreement</a>; for Gemini,<a href="https://www.gemini.com/legal/user-agreement">https://www.gemini.com/legal/user-agreement</a>; and for bitFlyer, <a href="https://bitflyer.com/en-jp/usepolicy">https://bitflyer.com/en-jp/usepolicy</a>. You must complete all additional verification steps required by the Custodian to become one of their verified members. Company will not have control of your Publisher Wallet. Company has no responsibility or liability with respect to your use of your Publisher Wallet, or your inability to use or access your Publisher Wallet, regardless of cause. Company also has no responsibility or liability with respect to any disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and your Custodian.</p><p>You must maintain the security of your Publisher Account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Publisher Account without your permission. If you permit others to use your Publisher Account credentials, you are responsible for the activities of such users that occur in connection with your Publisher Account. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact information in your Publisher Account and for maintaining your Publisher Wallet with your Custodian.</p><h2 id="4-contributions">4. Contributions</h2><p>Each Brave browser operated by a person who activates Brave Rewards in their Brave browser (a "<em>Brave Rewards User</em>") from time to time indicates to one of our servers that they wish to contribute BAT to Brave Verified Publisher(s). This indication is made via a privacy-protecting protocol which allows us to calculate the total contributed to each Brave Verified Publisher without knowing which Brave Verified Publisher(s) each Brave Rewards User contributed to. The Brave Rewards User contribution mechanism is described in further detail in the <a href="/user-terms-of-service/">Brave Rewards Terms of Service for Users</a>.</p><p>The total amount of Brave Rewards User contributions assigned to each site is calculated approximately every calendar month. Contributions are sent from User Wallets and made available to sites that are Brave Verified Publishers approximately through a process facilitated by Brave and/or third-party wallet providers. This process is typically completed by the 8th day of the following calendar month. For operating the Service, we charge Brave Verified Publishers a fee equal to 5% of the contributions assigned to them.</p><p>Assignment of contributions to Brave Verified Publishers will be calculated solely based on our accounting. You will not be entitled to any publisher contributions if you are in breach of these Terms at any point during the time period in which such publisher contributions would have otherwise accrued. You will also not be entitled to receive any publisher contribution immediately following the effective date of your Publisher Account termination or suspension. Publisher contributions may be withheld to reflect or adjusted to exclude any amounts arising from breach of these Terms.</p><p>In addition to our other rights and remedies, we may require you to return within 30 days of any publisher contribution, or may elect to deduct from your subsequent publisher contributions, any amounts that were erroneously sent to you in prior periods, including as a result of our later discovery that you were in breach of these Terms during such prior periods. If you dispute any publisher contribution amount sent to you, you must notify us at <a href="mailto:publishers@basicattentiontoken.org">publishers@basicattentiontoken.org</a> within thirty days of receiving any such contribution. If you do not, you waive any claim relating to any such disputed publisher contribution.</p><p>You are responsible for any other charges assessed by your Custodian or any other third party in connection with publisher contributions. We are also not a party to, and have no responsibility or liability with respect to, any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any Brave Rewards User.</p><h2 id="5-company-contributed-bat">5. Company-contributed BAT</h2><h3 id="1-user-growth-pool">1. User Growth Pool</h3><p>The User Growth Pool is a pool of Company-owned BAT allocated to encouraging use of the Platform and Services. We may from time to time make <em>UGP Grants</em> available to Brave Rewards Users. UGP Grants allow Brave Rewards Users to use Brave Rewards without adding BAT to their User Wallets. Instead, Company makes contributions to Brave Verified Publishers from the User Growth Pool.</p><p>We make UGP Grants for the specific purpose of encouraging the use of the Services to support Brave Verified Publishers whose work Brave Rewards Users appreciate. Any other use of UGP Grants is prohibited. More information about UGP Grants for Brave Rewards Users is in the <a href="/user-terms-of-service/">Brave Rewards: Terms of Service for Users</a>.</p><p>When a Brave Rewards User attempts to contribute BAT from a UGP Grant to a Brave Verified Publisher, we may undertake additional analysis to ensure that their contribution is legitimate. We reserve the right to not fulfill a UGP Grant, to prohibit a Brave Rewards User from using UGP Grants, or prohibit a Brave Verified publisher from receiving UGP grants at our discretion, including if we detect attempts to defraud us, to use automated means to use UGP Grants, to use the same UGP Grant multiple times, or to misuse the UGP Grant in any way.</p><p>Misuse of grants includes (but is not limited to):</p><ul><li>(a) creating Brave Verified Publisher channels without substantial creative content, with the intent to accept UGP Grants via these channels; or</li><li>(b) any mechanism that results in a Brave browser contributing a UGP Grant automatically, without a deliberate action by the person using that browser.</li></ul><p>BAT used as part of our Referral Program also comes from the User Growth Pool.</p><h3 id="2-restrictions-on-use">2. Restrictions on Use</h3><p>Company will not contribute BAT we own to any person or organization, who in our sole judgement:</p><ul><li>(a) engages in or advocates for violence, online or offline,</li><li>(b) directly incites violence against individuals or groups, online or offline, or</li><li>(c) directly threatens any person, place, organization or group.</li></ul><p>BAT we own includes that used for UGP Grants as well as that used as part of our Referral Program which is described in Section 19.</p><h2 id="6-taxes">6. Taxes</h2><p>You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Services, and for withholding, collecting, reporting and remitting the correct taxes, if any, to the appropriate tax authorities. Company is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any tax arising from your use of the Services.

We are not responsible for the collection, use or sharing of any information that you provide to third parties or that such third parties collect from you.</p><p>You must provide accurate Account Information and promptly update such Account Information if it changes. You may update or correct Account Information at any time by logging into your Publisher Account.

In addition, this Section 8 does not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.</p><h2 id="9-acknowledgment-of-risks-related-to-platform-and-bat">9. Acknowledgment of Risks Related to Platform and BAT</h2><p>As noted above, the integration of the Platform with the Brave browser is an integral part of the Services.
