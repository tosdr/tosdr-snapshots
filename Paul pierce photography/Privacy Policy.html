  <p>
    At Paul Pierce Photography, we are dedicated to keeping your interactions with us
    and on our site between you and us in each instance that we can. With that said,
    there are some instances where we must share your information with third parties
    in order to do business with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    By continuing to use this website or otherwise accepting our Terms of Service, you
    agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service of this website, which
    is owned and operated by Paul Pierce Photography.

  <h2>
    What do we collect?
  </h2>
  <p>
    In the normal course of visiting this website, we use cookies to help navigate our
    pages and provide a more efficient user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this time, we do not currently track our users via any analytic tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Google's reCAPTCHA service to prevent spam emails on our service, but we only
    use it to the minimum requirements to send email. Google recommends that reCAPTCHA
    be tagged on all pages of a website to help better track users, but this is a position
    that we reject for your privacy. It may mean that you are required to verify that you
    are not a robot every time you send an email to us via our contact page, but we think
    your privacy is worth the small inconvenience.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Information that you may provide voluntarily.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Personal Information: You may provide your name, address, email address, phone number
    and other information via our contact feature solely at your discretion and we will
    protect it as best we can protect unencrypted email. To ensure that you are not put
    at greater risk than you like, do not include any information such as social security
    numbers, credit card numbers, or any other personal information that may be used to
    steal your identity or harm you in any other way. If you provide any such information,
    we cannot guarantee its safety and will not be responsible if it is intercepted or
    stolen by third parties. If we notice that an email with such information has come
    into our servers, we will delete it, but do not guarantee that unless you contact us.
    It may still have some residual digital footprint as servers are constantly backed up
    by our service providers.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you accidentally provide too much personal information and would like it removed
    from our servers to the extent possible, please contact us via our contact form or at
    paul@paulpiercephotography.com with the subject “REMOVE PII” and we will follow up to
    remove your information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Payment Information: Our website does not currently accept payments of any kind so
    please do not include payment information in any form on our site.
  </p>
  <h2>
