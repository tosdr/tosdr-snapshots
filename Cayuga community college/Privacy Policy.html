                    <p><strong>Purpose for Processing the Personal Data</strong><br/>Monsido is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that provides access to Services that scan and analyze our website. The Services consist of a collection of tools for controlling and optimizing website content, accessibility review, improving search engine optimization (SEO), monitoring website performance, and utilizing website analytics data. As such, their services collect and process our website data by crawling the Cayuga website, storing cache copies of the content, analyzing the content, and detailing the results in reports generated on their SaaS platform.<br/><br/><strong>The Personal Data that We Collect</strong><br/>Monsido may collect information that personally identifies our website visitors and individuals whose information appears on our website (“Personal Data”). Personal Data on our website will typically consist of names, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or any other information on our website which can be directly or indirectly attributed to an individual. Cayuga does not typically post these items on our website, other than a student’s name (e.g. Dean's Listing).<br/><br/>Monsido’s Services are not intended for the collection or processing of any sensitive data (e.g., health or sex life information; racial or ethnic origin; political opinions or religious/ philosophical beliefs; trade union membership).<br/><br/><strong>Methods Used to Collect Personal Data</strong><br/><br/>There are two potential ways in which data is collected:<br/><br/><strong>Crawler.</strong><br/>Monsido’s services utilize web crawlers to scan our website. Web crawlers are computer programs that scan the website, read everything they find, and store that data in Monsido’s databases. This information is represented in reports that are subsequently generated through their SaaS platform.<br/><strong>Analytics.</strong><br/>Analytics requires that you install a JavaScript snippet on the master template of our website so that certain data will be captured. When a page with the JavaScript snippet loads, the script will provide information on the website visitor.<br/><br/>Monsido also uses cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. A website visitor may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on her or his browser. For more information on cookies and how a website visitor can remove them according to the type of browser used, refer to www.allaboutcookies.org.     <br/><br/>Monsido’s cookies are used to help visitors’ use of the website. It is used to collect statistics about site usage, such as when the visitor last visited the site. This information is then used to improve the user experience on the website. This Monsido Analytics cookie contains a randomly generated ID used to recognize the browser when a visitor reads a page. The cookie contains no personal information and is used only for web analytics.<br/><br/>Monsido’s cookies are used purely to track the sequence of pages a visitor looks at during a visit to the site. This information can be used to create user journeys and enable visitors to find relevant information quickly.<br/>    <br/>To ask questions or comment about this Monsido’s policies and their privacy practices, contact them at privacy@monsido.com.</p>                  </div>

<p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>


  <h3 id="rights_subjects">The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
<p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>

<p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
  <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
</li>
  <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</li>

<h4 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-right-to-object">
  Details about the right to object to processing
</h4>
<p><strong>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document. </strong></p>

<h4 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-legal-how-to-exercise">
