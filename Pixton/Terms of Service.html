All payments must be remitted through an account of a payment provider or processor approved by Pixton and you agree to abide by the terms and conditions applicable to that payment method. When you provide any payment account information to Pixton, you represent to Pixton that you are the authorized user of that payment account. Pixton’s approved third party payment provider or processor will automatically charge your chosen method of payment on a recurring basis for applicable fees in relation to your Account(s), plus any applicable taxes we are required to collect, where you authorize us to do so. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT(S). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ONCE YOU AUTHORIZE US AND/OR OUR APPROVED PAYMENT PROVIDER OR PROCESSOR TO CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT(S) AND/OR THE ASSOCIATED CREDIT CARD FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT, SUCH AMOUNT IS NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART AND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, UPON TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT(S) FOR ANY REASON, TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE AND/OR INTERRUPTION OR DISCONTINUATION OF THE SITE, SOME OR ALL OF THE CONTENT AND/OR SERVICES, EXCEPT AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF PIXTON. If you choose a recurring subscription or membership to the Site, Content and/or Services, you acknowledge that payments will be processed automatically until you cancel the subscription or the applicable Account(s). In all cases, your order will represent your offer to Pixton to acquire a license to the Content and/or Services ordered, which offer will be deemed to have been accepted by Pixton on the earlier of (i) the appearance and availability for use of that Content and/or Service through your Account(s) or (ii) when your payment account is charged.</p>

    <p><strong>When you sign up for a recurring subscription, membership or other ongoing Content and/or Services, you have the right to cancel the recurring arrangement in writing within seven (7) calendar days after you first entered into the recurring arrangement and you will receive a full refund of any fees paid within thirty (30) days. The period for any auto-renewal or recurring arrangement will be the same as the period you originally ordered unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of purchase. The charges made in connection with any auto-renewal or recurring arrangements will also be at the same rates as were in effect at the time of your original order unless Pixton gives you prior notice of any change to such charges before such charges are made for any subsequent renewal period. If you cancel an auto-renewal or recurring arrangement after the seven (7) day cancellation period or after you have accessed, downloaded, installed or used the Content and/or Services you ordered, you will not be entitled to a refund and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then current recurring period unless you request an earlier termination date in writing. Cancellation requests must be submitted by email to Pixton at: support@pixton.com.</strong></p>
