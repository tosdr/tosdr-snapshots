PILLPACK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE PILLPACK SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE PILLPACK SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE PILLPACK SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p> <p>TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, PILLPACK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. PILLPACK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PILLPACK SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE PILLPACK SERVICES, PILLPACK'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM PILLPACK ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, PILLPACK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY PILLPACK SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY PILLPACK SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.</p> <p>TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, PILLPACK IS FOUND TO BE LIABLE TO YOU, PILLPACK’S LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THE PARTICULAR INFORMATION OR SERVICE PROVIDED.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Disputes</p> <p><strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any PillPack Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by PillPack or through pillpack.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,</strong> except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p> <p><strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.</strong></p> <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, PillPack will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p> <p><strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong> If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Applicable Law</p> <p>By using any PillPack Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and PillPack.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Site Policies and Modification</p> <p>Please review our other policies, such as our <a href="/service-guide">Service Guide</a> posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of PillPack Services. PillPack reserves the right to make changes to our web site, policies, and these Terms of Use at any time.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Severability, Waiver, and Entire Agreement</p> <p>If any of these terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term. PillPack’s failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use and policies will not be construed as an implicit waiver of any provision or right.</p> <p>These Terms of Use and policies constitute the entire agreement between you and PillPack governing your use of the PillPack Services.</p> <p class="pp-txt-h">Copyright Infringement Complaints</p> <p>PillPack respects the intellectual property of others.
