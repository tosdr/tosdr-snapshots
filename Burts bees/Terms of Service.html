<h1 id="agreement">Complete Agreement</h1>
<h2 id="ecommerce">eCommerce</h2>
<p>Some of our Sites may allow you to purchase products directly on them (“eCommerce Sites”). Although we have a variety of eCommerce Sites that sell different types of products and services, the provisions of this Agreement apply to all of them.</p>
<p>Refunds, returns, and exchanges will not be issued for products that have not been purchased directly through an eCommerce Site. We reserve the right to deny a refund, return, or exchange, and/or issue a shopping credit to your Account on the Site in our sole discretion for any reason including, without limitation, if we determine that you are not entitled to a refund, return, exchange, and/or issue a shopping credit or if our policy is being abused. We may use any means available to us, including coordination with other companies, to determine if you are abusing our policy. This decision is made in our sole discretion and determination.</p>
<h2 id="orders">Orders</h2>
<p>We may make improvements and/or changes in products or services described on the Sites, add new features, or terminate a Site at any time without notice. We also: (a) reserve the right to change the goods and services advertised or offered for sale through an eCommerce Site, the prices, ingredients or specifications of such goods and services, and any promotional offers at any time without any notice or liability to you or any other person; (b) cannot guarantee that goods or services advertised or offered for sale on an eCommerce Site will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) do not warrant that information on a Site (including without limitation product descriptions, colors or photographs) is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserve the right to modify, cancel, terminate or not process orders (including accepted orders) where the price or other material information on an eCommerce Site is inaccurate, where we have insufficient quantities to fulfill an order or for any other reason in our sole discretion. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you. Unless otherwise indicated (or if the eCommerce Site has a non-U.S. domain), products sold on the eCommerce Sites are intended for end use in the United States and are not labeled or intended for international distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> If we are legally required to collect sales tax on merchandise you order, the tax amount will be added automatically to your purchase price. On rare occasions an error in our state sales tax database may cause the sales tax charge to be incorrect. If this happens, at any time up to two years from your date of purchase you may contact us for a refund of tax overcharges. This right to a refund is your exclusive remedy for sales tax errors.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> We may use a third party payment processor to process your payment information, including your payment card data. Be aware that you may be subject to the third party processor’s terms and your information may be subject to their privacy practices.</p>
<h2 id="returns">Returns and Exchanges</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with any product that you purchased through an eCommerce Site, you may return it or exchange it subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>In order to request a return or exchange, you must contact our customer service department by following the instructions on the eCommerce Site. Some eCommerce Sites may also let you request a return or exchange through your Account or through other functionality.</li>
<li>In your return or exchange request, you must indicate the specific product with which you are not satisfied, and include your order number, name, and contact information, as well as the reason for your return or exchange request and the new product with which you would like to replace the returned product if you are requesting an exchange.</li>
<li>If we accept your return or exchange request, you must initiate the return of the applicable product within 60 days from the date of original shipment. Products returned after the 60-day return period will receive a shopping credit to your Account on the Site based on the original amount of payment. If you do not have an Account, we may issue you a shopping credit through other means.</li>
<li>In order to initiate the return of a product, you will need to use a return label that we provide you. Once you repackage the product that you are returning, securely affix the return label to you to your package, and drop off your package at a local post office or courier office, your return or exchange will begin to be processed as soon as we have confirmed receipt of your return. We may not reimburse you for any shipping and handling fees that you incurred in returning any such product.</li>
<li>Promptly within receipt of a returned product, a credit will be issued back to the original method of payment if you selected a refund, or the new products that you requested will be shipped to you if you requested an exchange.</li>
<li>Please note that a new product for which you want to exchange the returned product may not be in stock. In such case, you will receive a shopping credit as described above.</li>
<li>If you are making an exchange, new products that are in stock may not equate to an even exchange and there may be a price difference between the new product and the returned product. Any difference in pricing for an exchange will be placed back on the original method of payment. If we are unable to do so, your exchange may not be completed. We may contact you for new payment information or elect to treat it as a return instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
<p>Some eCommerce Sites sell products for which we do not allow a return or exchange, but do allow a refund; meaning all or a portion of the purchase price is returned to you without you providing the item back to us. This may be indicated on the applicable eCommerce Site or may be communicated by our customer service. Typically, products eligible for returns or exchanges are not eligible for refunds. We reserve the right to only issue a refund, or require a return or exchange, in our sole discretion regardless of what an eCommerce Site may indicate. Refunds will not be issued for products that have not been purchased directly through the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> For refund eligible products, you have 90 days from the date of shipment to contact us for a full refund of the purchase price (less shipping and handling fees). Following such 90-day period, no product is eligible for a refund. However, even after 90 days, we encourage you to contact us if you are unsatisfied with a product and so our customer service can improve your experience, which may include providing an exception to this refund policy.</p>
<p><strong>Guarantees:</strong> Some of our products or brands carry a “guarantee” which may allow for refunds for longer than 90 days. If so guaranteed, all terms of the guarantee apply and such guarantee will be treated as a refund for the purpose of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions:</strong> Your refund is subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>In order to request a refund you must contact our customer service department by following the instructions on the eCommerce Site. Some eCommerce Sites may also let you request a refund through your Account or through other functionality.</li>
<li>In your refund request, you must indicate the specific product with which you are not satisfied and include your order number, name, and contact information, as well as the reason for your refund request.</li>
<li>If we accept your refund request, you will receive a credit to your original form of payment. If we are unable to credit that form of payment, your refund may not be completed. We may contact you for new payment information or provide your refund in another way, such as through your Account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping">Shipping</h2>
<p>We process orders daily Monday through Friday from our fulfillment centers. Most orders are shipped the next business day, or in some cases the same business day. You can expect delivery within 3 to 10 business days of your order shipping out. If you choose 2-Day Air service, you can expect your order to arrive in 2 business days from the date of shipment.

Most products may be shipped to a P.O. Box or Military APO/FPO addresses, but some restrictions apply. Please make sure your address is correct. Once in transit, we cannot redirect shipments to a new or different address. If your order is returned for an invalid or incorrect address the order will be refunded less any shipping charges.</p>

<h3 id="chatbot">Interactive Chat and Chatbots</h3>
<p>Some of our Sites may have chat, live support, instant messaging, or similar functionality to serve you better (<strong>“Chats”</strong>). Chats may allow you to speak to a human representative, a Chatbot (as defined below), or some combination of the two. You should review our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> to learn how we treat information that could identify you gathered via a Chat. If you are signed in to an Account while using a Chat, the Chat may link the Account information with you or the Chat interaction. You may not impersonate or attempt to gain information regarding another individual via a Chat. Information provided via a Chat may be inaccurate, and Chat’s may not always be available or error-free. Chats may be provided by third parties, and you may be entering into a contractual agreement with those third parties when you use the Chat. You should refer to the applicable Chat and its hyperlinks to learn more.</p>
<p>Chats may use interactive, automated computer programs and similar technologies to provide customer service via the Chat (<strong>“Chatbots”</strong>). Chatbots often work by using “natural language processing” technology to understand your questions and inputs and respond to them with relevant information or follow-up inquiries. Our Chatbots typically identify that you are interacting with a computer program and not a human, sometimes by a “Powered by…” or a similar legend in the Chat or by setting up the Chat in such a way that its apparent that a Chatbot is used.

<h2 id="disputes">Disputes, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.  </strong></p>
<p>ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Applicability of this Dispute Resolution Policy:</strong> The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). You and Clorox agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Clorox, including those known or unknown that may be later discovered, arising out of or relating to any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Site, your use or attempted use of any products or services made available via the Site, all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, other agreements on the Site, or the <a href="https://www.thecloroxcompany.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, and including Disputes (defined below) even if the acts, omissions or relationships giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms of Use (or such modification) (each, a “Dispute”) shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator unless specifically excluded from arbitration as set forth in this Section. However, if you or we initiated an arbitration or lawsuit prior to this version of the Terms of Use (or such modification), that arbitration or lawsuit will continue to be governed by the version of the Terms of Use applicable when the arbitration or lawsuit was initiated. Each provision of this Section applies to the maximum extent permitted by law whether or not so expressly stated.  Additionally, if a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and we agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution Period:</strong> Our customer support department is available at 800-849-7112 to address any concerns you may have regarding the Site or the products or services available on the Site. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers&#8217; satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least sixty (60) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the “Initial Dispute Resolution Period”). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If we have a dispute with you, we will send the notice of that Dispute to your billing address and/or email address you have provided to us. If you have a dispute with us, you agree to send us a written notice by certified mail of your claim, addressed to: General Counsel, The Clorox Company, 1221 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, and will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or us to later initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph:  (a) description of the nature of the claim or dispute and the underlying facts; (b) date upon which the Dispute arose; (c) the specific relief sought; and (d) name, email address, and physical mailing address of the party seeking relief.  The Initial Dispute Resolution Period must include a conference between you and us to attempt to informally resolve any Dispute in good faith. You will personally appear at the conference telephonically or via videoconference; if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same conference unless all parties agree.  Compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is mandatory and a condition precedent to initiating an arbitration or litigation.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.  If either party violates this Initial Dispute Resolution Period paragraph, a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to enjoin the prosecution of the arbitration or court proceeding, and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration provider shall neither accept nor administer any such arbitration nor assess fees in connection with such arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>: If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute following the Initial Dispute Resolution Period (and including the conference of the parties provided in the preceding paragraph), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.  The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, which are available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.jamsadr.com</a>, unless it is a Mass Arbitration before NAM, as defined below.  If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you or we may file a Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Expedited Procedures in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> In order to initiate arbitration following the conclusion of the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, a party must provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration and file the demand with the applicable arbitration provider.  A party initiating an arbitration against Clorox must send the written demand for arbitration to General Counsel, The Clorox Company, 1221 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612.  By signing the demand for arbitration, the party and its counsel certifies to the best of the party’s and counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (i) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (iv) the party has complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, including participation in an in-person conference, as described above. The Arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or any applicable state law for either party’s violation of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Appointment of Arbitrator:</strong> Unless all parties to the Arbitration agree, the Arbitrator shall be a lawyer on the JAMS roster admitted to practice for at least 20 years or a retired United States District Court Judge.</p>
<p><strong>Location &amp; Hearing:</strong> Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision:</strong> The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and us, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Fees:</strong> Your and our right to recover attorneys’ fees, costs and arbitration fees shall be governed by the laws that apply to the parties’ Dispute, as well as any applicable arbitration rules. Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon showing that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, defense, or procedural tactic that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Arbitration Before NAM</strong>: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS (and subject to the exceptions otherwise set forth in the “Exceptions to Binding Arbitration” paragraph), if 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “NAM Rules”), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The NAM Rules are available at <a href="https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/</a> or by calling <a href="tel:18003582550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-800-358-2550</a>. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.namadr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.namadr.com/</a>. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with NAM, you and we agree to contact NAM jointly to advise that the parties intend to use NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on NAM’s claim form(s) and as directed by NAM. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from NAM compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.  If for any reason the provisions in this Mass Arbitration Before NAM paragraph are found to be unenforceable, or if for any reason NAM declines to administer the Mass Arbitration, then the Disputes comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be administered by AAA consistent with the provisions of the Dispute Resolution Section of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Appointment of Procedural Arbitrator in Mass Arbitration</strong>. You and we agree to cooperate in good faith to implement the Mass Arbitration process to minimize the time, filing fees, and costs of the Mass Arbitration. Those steps include, but are not limited to (1) the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the Mass Arbitration and to rule on proposals by the parties for the efficient and cost-effective management of the Mass Arbitration to the extent the parties cannot agree; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar for the arbitration proceedings.  If the parties are unable to agree upon a Procedural Arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the commencement of the mass arbitration, then NAM will appoint the Procedural Arbitrator in accordance with the NAM Rules.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration</strong>. Notwithstanding the parties&#8217; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may invoke the following exceptions to arbitration:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Provisional remedies in aid of arbitration</strong>: Either party may seek provisional remedies in aid of arbitration and to enforce the Initial Dispute Resolution Period from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, subject to the forum selection provisions below.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property and Trade Secret Disputes</strong>: Either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, subject to the forum selection provisions below.</li>
<li><strong>Small Claims Court</strong>. Either party may seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#8217;s jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case, in which instance no filing fees shall be due or payable by either party. Any disagreement about whether a Dispute is subject to small claims court shall be decided by small claims court or a court of competent jurisdiction, not the arbitrator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class and Collective Action Waiver</strong>. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law:</strong> This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations</strong>. To the fullest extent allowed by low, you and we agree that if any Dispute has a statute of limitations in excess of two years, such Dispute must be filed within two years after the Dispute accrued or it will be forever barred.</p>
<p><strong>Forum</strong>. To the fullest extent allowed by low, you and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in Oakland, California, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts for any Dispute not subject to binding arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision in this Disputes, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Section of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Section of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. <strong>The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or collective actions as provided for above. This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief and any appeals have been exhausted (or if the decision is otherwise final), then such claim or request for relief shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction, but it shall be stayed pending arbitration of all other claims and requests for relief.</strong></p>
