<li><strong>Public.</strong> We may offer community features and public interactive forums through our websites, such as discussion boards, product reviews, chat rooms, forums, wikis, social networking platforms and blogs. If you decide to submit information on these pages, that information may be publicly available.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Promotion.</strong> We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third-party partners. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third-party partner the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them. Their use of your information is not governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Wedding, Baby, and/or Gift Registry.</strong> Some of our websites provide the opportunity to create public registries where you can indicate to others what types of products you might be interested in receiving. The information that you provide about your event (<em>e.g.,</em> name, date, location, etc.) as part of a public registry may be publicly available to permit your guests to search for your registry. In some cases, we may provide you with options to restrict the extent to which that information will be made available to the public. We may also share your information with third-party wedding and gift registry portal sites. Among other things this provides your guests with additional means of finding your registry and coordinating gifts.</li>
<li><strong>Other Disclosures with Your Consent.</strong> We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</li>

<p>Click <a href="/privacy/how-we-share-information">here</a> for a description of the categories of information we disclose for a “business purpose” and share for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising (also referred to as “targeted advertising”) (as those terms are defined by applicable law). Please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we share about people other than yourself. Note that we do not “sell” your personal information for money. As discussed elsewhere in the Privacy Policy, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies, as well as share email addresses and other non-cookie personal information, for purposes of behavioral advertising. Under applicable law, this may be considered a “sale.” For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://www.thecloroxcompany.com/privacy/information-we-collect/#cookies">Cookies and Other Similar Tracking Technologies page</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Submitting Requests</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law. If we deny or fail to take action on your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at <a title="mailto:privacyinfo@clorox.com" contenteditable="false" href="mailto:privacyinfo@clorox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacyinfo@clorox.com</a> with the subject line “Appeal.”</p>
<p>Please note that to protect your information we must be able to verify your identity before we can process your request to exercise any of the foregoing privacy rights. We may conduct the verification process by email or phone, and we may ask you to provide information such as your name, contact information, and any additional relevant information based on your relationship with us.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, certain individuals may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on their behalf. To do so, you must provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. Note that we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of another person, you must attach a copy of a completed <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Clorox_Authorized-Agent-Designation-Form-Updated-for-CPRA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authorized Agent Designation </a>form indicating that you are able to act on that other person’s behalf.</p>

<h2 id="protect">How We Protect and Retain Information</h2>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach affecting your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
<p>Additionally, we maintain internal governance policies designed to protect your personal information. These governance policies cover topics including, but not limited to, information security, incident response, data subject rights, and record retention and destruction.</p>
<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, selecting a strong password and constructing a unique password. You are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
<p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel" />
<h2 id="misc">Other Important Information</h2>
<p>The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Children.</strong> Our websites and online services are not intended for children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 18, without parental consent. Children under the age of 18 should not provide their personal information to us.</li>
<li><strong>International Data Transfers.</strong> As a multi-national company, we transmit information between and among our affiliates. As a result, your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Nonetheless, where possible we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information. For example, when we transmit information from Europe to the United States, we rely upon Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European commission for the transfer of data. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States. If you would like more information concerning our foreign processing policies and arrangements, including attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information below.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Applications/Websites.</strong> We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. Any personal information that you provide through third party websites, applications or other means will be governed by the privacy policies applicable to those third parties and mediums.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</strong> We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices, technology, legal requirements and other factors. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, they will become immediately effective when published. You can check the “Last Updated” legend at the bottom of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.</li>
