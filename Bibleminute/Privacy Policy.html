                        <p>Certain features available within the Products or Services will require you to submit PII about yourself as a condition of participation.

                           <p><strong>How Do We Protect Personal Data?</strong>  We take information security seriously, and we use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the PII we collect from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The Operator protects data using administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.  When we use third-party service providers, we ask those providers to implement similar safeguards. However, we cannot guarantee that your information is completely secure either within the Company or on the systems of third-party service providers.</p> 
                           <p>But we have no control over the security of other websites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those websites on our Products or through our Services. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your PII.</p>
                           <p>Additionally, and as you are likely aware, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your PII, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Operator’s web sites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on any of the Operator’s web sites.</p>
                           <p>In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your PII. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/">http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/</a> for information about how to protect against identity theft. </p>

                        <p>We retain personal data we collect from you when we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (i.e., to provide you with the Services you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will physically destroy, delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                            <h3>Important Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Product and Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="https://privacyportal.cookiepro.com/webform/8becd7f7-c923-4cd4-814a-e08c34baf60b/f5166605-38e6-4c90-b937-5fc0da2d55a3">Do Not Sell My Data</a>.</p>
                            <p>These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and together with all applicable regulations (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights. The words used in this section have the meanings given to them in the CCPA, which may be broader than their common meaning. For example, the definition of “personal information” under the CCPA includes your name, but also more general information such as age.</p>
                            <h4>Notice of Collection</h4>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The categories of personal information that we may have collected – as described by the CCPA – in the past 12 months are:</p>
                            <p>Identifiers: name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol (IP) address, email address, account name. We may use this data to provide customers with an account, enabling them to post listings or messages, or subscribe to our newsletters. Additionally, we use online identifiers to understand how consumers use our products and services.</p>
                            <p>Customer records information: name, address, telephone number, bank account number, credit, or debit card number. We collect this information when a user performs a payment transaction on one of our services. </p>
                            <p>Commercial information: We use a unique identifier to track consumer behavior on our products. We then use that data to personalize content and or advertising products to the consumer.</p>
                            <p>Internet or other electronic network activity information: We collect this data specific to our websites and applications. We do not operate a web browser or search technology, but we track searches performed on our website. We do this for a few purposes. We allow users to create saved searches and alerts. Saved searches and alerts enable users to opt-in to a notification service. When the user creates a saved search, if a new product is posted on our service that matches their search criteria, we will send them an email or mobile phone alert. We also use their search behavior to personalize content and advertising.</p>
                            <p>Geolocation data: When using our service, a user can search for information using location data such as a city or zip code. Furthermore, on a mobile device, users can opt-in to the mobile device geolocation service to show the user listings from a selected mile radius from their current geolocation.</p>
                            <p>Inferences: We use consumer behavior to create profiles and make inferences about future consumer behavior. </p>
                            <p>We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business purposes and sharing practices described in our policy above.</p>
                            <p>We do not generally “sell” personal information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the above sections as a “sale,” we provide you the option to request that we not “sell” your personal information. We do not sell the personal information of minors known to be under the age of 16 without affirmative authorization.</p>
                            <p>We sell or disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, demographic information, commercial information, internet activity, geolocation data and inferences. We use and partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations and manage our services.</p>
                            <h4>Right to Know and Delete</h4>
                            <p></p>

                                <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing: if sold, personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased, and if disclosed for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained;</li>

To verify your identity, we will request and collect additional personal information from you to match it against our records. We may ask for additional information or documentation if we feel it is necessary to confirm your identity with the necessary degree of certainty. We may communicate with you through email, a secure message center, or other reasonably necessary and appropriate means. We do have the right to deny requests under certain circumstances. In such cases, we will notify you of the reasons for denial. We will not provide you with specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of that personal information, your account with us, or the security of our systems or networks. In no event will we disclose, if we have collected it, your Social Security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an account password, or security questions and answers.</p>

                            <p></p>  
                            <p>You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of your rights.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p>Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking cookies as browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Policy accordingly. More information about “do not track” is available at <a href="www.allaboutdnt.com">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p>These additional disclosures for Utah residents apply only to individuals who reside in Utah. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act provides additional rights to confirm, access, delete, obtain a copy, and opt-out, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights. The words used in this section have the meanings given to them in the UCPA, which may be broader than their common meaning.</p>
                            <h4>Notice of Collection</h4>
                            <p></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The categories of personal information that we may have collected in the past 12 months are:</p>
                           <p>Identifiers: name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol (IP) address, email address, account name. We may use this data to provide customers with an account which enables them to post listings or messages, or to subscribe to our newsletters. Additionally, we use online identifiers to understand how consumers use our products and services.</p> 
                           <p>Customer records information: name, address, telephone number, bank account number, credit, or debit card number. We collect this information when a user performs a payment transaction on one of our services.</p>
                           <p>Commercial information: We use a unique identifier to track consumer behavior on our products. We then use that data to personalize content and/or advertising products to the consumer.</p>
                           <p>Internet or other electronic network activity information: We collect this data specific to our websites and applications. We do not operate a web browser or search technology, but we may track searches performed on our website. We do this for a few purposes. We allow users to create saved searches and alerts. Saved searches and alerts enable users to opt-in to a notification service. When the user creates a saved search, if a new product is posted on our service that matches their search criteria, we will send them an email or mobile phone alert. We also use their search behavior to personalize content and advertising.</p>
                           <p>Geolocation data: When using our service, a user can search for information using location data such as a city or zip code. Furthermore, on a mobile device, users can opt-in to the mobile device geolocation service to show the user listings from a selected mile radius from their current geolocation.</p>
                           <p>Inferences: We use consumer behavior to create profiles and make inferences about future consumer behavior. </p>
                           <p>We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business purposes and sharing practices described in our policy above.</p>
                           <p>We do not generally “sell” personal information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale” under the UCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the above sections as a “sale,” we provide you the option to request that we not “sell” your personal information. We do not sell the personal information of minors known to be under the age of 13 without affirmative authorization.</p>
                           <p>We may sell or disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, demographic information, commercial information, internet activity, geolocation data and inferences. We use and partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations and manage our services.</p>
                           <p><strong>What Are My Rights Under the UCPA?</strong> If you are a Utah resident and are engaged in a direct business relationship with Company as a consumer for the provision of the Sites or Services, you may have the following rights:</p>

                            <p>Though you may request specific pieces of your personal information that we have collected, we may not provide the following information in order to protect the security of such information: social security numbers, driver’s license or other state or government-issued identification numbers, bank account numbers or other financial information, any health insurance or medical identification numbers or related information, account passwords or security questions and answers.</p>
                            <ul>
