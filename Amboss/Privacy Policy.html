As part of setting up a corresponding user account, you must provide a password in addition to your e-mail address. This information is used for login and secure identification on our site. If the registration and/or login takes place via a single sign-on procedure (SSO) of an institution (e.g. university or clinic), we will forward you to the respective website of the institution for the purpose of logging in and will transmit the e-mail address entered by you on our website for this purpose to the institution. After a successful login, information about you, namely your first and last name, affiliation with the institution and e-mail address, will be transmitted to us by the institution for the purpose of identification and processed by us for the provision and use of our offer on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
