","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"You and we each agree that our agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern the enforceability of this dispute resolution process. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages as a court.\n\nYour right to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU BECOME BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt Out Deadline”). If you do not wish to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement, you must timely notify us by sending an email to ArbitrationOptOut@Collectors.com and providing the following information in your email: (1) your name; (2) your address; (3) your phone number, and (4) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Any opt-out notice received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.\n\nInformal resolution. We will first try to resolve any Claim informally. You and we agree to negotiate to resolve your claim in good faith. You agree that you may not start a formal proceeding for at least 60 days after you notify us of a Claim in writing, consistent with the Notice and Demand requirements below.\n\nIf you intend to file a demand for arbitration, in order to give us an opportunity to informally resolve your claim, you must first send us, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice should be addressed to Collectors Arbitration, Attn: Legal Department, 1610 E. St. Andrew Pl., Santa Ana, California 92705. If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, or immediately upon the Collectors Entity’s denial of your Claims, you or we may start an arbitration by filing a Demand for Arbitration (“Demand”), as set forth below, or start small claims court proceedings.\n\nFormal resolution. If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, then either you or we may seek to formally resolve any Claim by starting arbitration or small claims proceedings under the following agreed procedure and rules.\n\nTo begin arbitration, you must send a Demand to us and to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You and we agree that any and all Claims will be submitted to final, binding, and confidential arbitration before the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Commercial Arbitration Rules, as applicable to a particular dispute (“AAA Rules”). Where any of the AAA rules conflict with the terms of this arbitration agreement, however, the terms of our agreement will control. Our agreement to arbitrate is retroactive in effect and applies to all Claims regardless of whether they accrued before or after the User Agreement and this agreed dispute resolution procedure went into effect.\n\nOur agreement to submit all Claims to arbitration includes all disputes or questions about arbitrability, all claims for temporary, injunctive, or declaratory relief, and all claims arising under any federal or state statute, rule, or regulation. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU AND WE WAIVE OUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. WE BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION IS A DISPUTE-RESOLUTION PROCESS THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM FILING A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND THAT BY AGREEING TO SUBMIT ALL CLAIMS TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE ARE EACH GIVING UP OUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND OUR RIGHT FOR A JURY TO DECIDE OUR CASE. YOU CAN OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE.\n\nYou and we agree that Claims submitted to arbitration will be decided in a single arbitration before a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates; (2) if the parties cannot agree to select an arbitrator from that list of five, then within 14 days, each party will return its list to the AAA striking up to two candidates and ranking the remaining candidates by order of preference, (3) the AAA will appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest preferred ranking on an aggregated basis; and (4) if for some reason appointment cannot be made under this procedure, the AAA will have discretion to appoint an arbitrator of its choosing.\n\nWe will pay or reimburse all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. If, however, the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in the Demand was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. For claims under $75,000 as to which you provided Notice and negotiated in good faith before starting an arbitration, if the arbitrator finds you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, then you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek recovery of our attorneys’ fees from you even where it might otherwise be permitted under applicable law.\n\nIf the Claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court (e.g., for Claims that do not exceed the jurisdictional limit of small claims court), then either you or we may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing.\n\nClass action waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT FOR ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER BROUGHT IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, CLAIMS MAY BE BROUGHT ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND IN THE NAME OF AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON OR ENTITY AND THAT CLAIMS MUST PROCEED ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CLASS AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THAT MEANS YOU AND WE WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AND CANNOT ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR NON-REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS. You and we agree that Claims of two or more persons may not be joined or consolidated in the same arbitration unless arising from the same transaction. Furthermore, you and we agree that neither you nor we may pursue claims in arbitration as a class or collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative action. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award relief only on an individual basis. The AAA Rules for Class Actions will not apply to our arbitration. If you opt out of this dispute resolution process and arbitration agreement as described above, this class action waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other individual, can be a class representative or class member in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.\n\nJury trial waiver. If a Claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, YOU AND WE EACH STILL WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n\nSeverability. If any part of this dispute resolution process and arbitration agreement is held invalid and unenforceable, then that part may be severed from the rest of the agreement. You and we agree that any ruling by an arbitrator or court allowing any claimant to seek relief for other persons in a representative capacity would be contrary to your and our intent and would require immediate judicial review. If we believe that any Claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with the class action waiver, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver.","nodeType":"text"}]}]},{"data":{},"nodeType":"list-item","content":[{"data":{},"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AND PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND COLLECTORS AND ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, DESIGNEES AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, THIRD–PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS, CONTRACTORS, DISTRIBUTORS, MERCHANTS, SPONSORS, LICENSORS AND THE LIKE (COLLECTIVELY, “RELEASED PARTIES”) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
