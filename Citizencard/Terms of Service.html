    government-issued ID is a serious criminal offence and The Company will always refer evidence of such to the
    Metropolitan Police Amberhill Fraud team.</p>
<p>5.4 The Applicant must complete all parts of the Postal Application Form correctly, complying fully with the
    requirements set out, including provision of a countersigned Application, countersigned photograph, if applicable
    countersigned Supporting Document, together with the correct payment. All the tickboxes within the Applicant
    Declaration must be ticked if the Application is to be successful.</p>
<p>5.5 If an online application is made via <a href="https://online.citizencard.com" target="_blank">online.citizencard.com</a>
    (an eApplication) the Applicant is responsible for ensuring that their Referee submits a 'Digital Referee
    Declaration Form' and for ensuring that their Referee provides CitizenCard with an electronic 'Statement of Truth'
    confirming the validity of the application, in particular that the photo supplied is a true likeness to the
    applicant, and that the applicant's details match those on the applicant's Supporting Document or they have
    confirmed the applicant's details against the official records held at their workplace. A Referee is not needed if
    the eApplication is made via the Applicant's original photo ID using the e-IDVT process.</p>
<p>5.6 The Applicant must take the Application form, together with two (2) photographs and if appropriate a copy of
    their original Supporting Document together with the original Supporting Document to a person qualified, able and
    willing to act, as a Referee. However, if the application is made via <a href="https://online.citizencard.com"
                                                                             target="_blank">online.citizencard.com</a>
    (an eApplication) using the Applicant's Supporting Document, the applicant must take the original Supporting
    Document to a person qualified, able and willing to act, as a Referee. A Referee is not needed if the eApplication
    is made via the Applicant's original photo ID using the e-IDVT process.</p>
<p>5.7 If you apply online, the Card age-band is automatically selected and determined by your date of birth. If you
    require a higher age-band, you must select it in the "Age-Band" section of the online application page. Failure to
    do this will result in a current age band card being issued.</p>
<p>5.8 If you apply using one of our Postal Application forms and require an 18+ card but you are still 17 years old
    when you apply you must attach a letter to your application requesting what age band you would like i.e. 18+ or
    16-17. The same applies if you are 15 but want a 16-17 card. Failure to do this will result in a lower age band card
    being issued. This also depends on form type.</p>
<p>5.9 You can choose the next age-band if the age-band on your card will change within 3 months of your application.
    Your application will be put on hold until you are eligible to receive the requested age-band.</p>
<p>5.10 The next age-band 16-17 or 18+ CitizenCard cannot be posted until one working day before your birthday; this is
    subject to your application being verified. If your birthday is on a Sunday your card will not be issued until the
    first working day after your birthday. If your birthday is on a Monday your card will be posted on the day of your
    birthday. The application process begins once your application is received at our office.</p>

<h2><a id="PAYMENT">7. PAYMENT</a></h2>
<p>7.1 Payment covers the cost of processing and verifying the application for a CitizenCard (the card itself remains
    the property of CitizenCard Limited). As soon as an application is submitted, either online or by post, CitizenCard
    Limited incurs costs in processing the information supplied. If an applicant wishes to cancel their application at
    any time they may do so but the application fees will not be refunded.</p>

    applications when CitizenCard has received the applicant's completed application form at its office.</p>
<p>7.3 The Applicant must choose whether to apply for standard or urgent application. Standard application takes up to
    21 days, urgent application takes up to 1-2 working days. For offline (printed) applications, the process begins

    to receive applicant photograph, e-IDVT (Electronic ID Validation Technology) report including uploaded photo ID
    document plus liveness check or Digital Referee Declaration and Referee's Statement of Truth (confirming applicant's
    photo as a true likeness and either that applicants details match those on the original Supporting Document or that
    the details match those held on the Official Records).</p>
<p>7.5 For an application received via the Yoti App, the process begins once the application has been submitted and paid
    for. If the photo or ID image (of the passport, driving licence or EU national identity card) supplied to us by Yoti

    responsible for making payment in full at the time of applying. Payment covers the cost of the Application
    Processing and Validation Service, not the Card itself which if issued remains at all times the legal property of
    The Company.</p>
<p>7.8 If full payment is not received the application will not be processed. Payment can be made by postal order,
    credit or debit Card. Cash cannot be accepted in payment unless the Applicant attends the London office of
    CitizenCard in person having made a prior appointment.</p>
<hr class="my-4">
<h2><a id="PARENTAL_CONSENT">8. PARENTAL CONSENT</a></h2>
<p>8.1 If the Applicant is below the age of sixteen (16) a parent or legal guardian with whom the Applicant is
    ordinarily resident must consent to the application providing their full name and signature.</p>
<p>8.2 If the Applicant is below the age of sixteen (16) they do not need to sign the Applicant Signature but all parts
    of the Applicant Declaration must be completed by the parent or legal guardian who is signing the parental
    consent.</p>
<hr class="my-4">
<h2><a id="PHOTOGRAPHS">9. PHOTOGRAPHS</a></h2>
<p>9.1 The Applicant must supply two (2) passport quality colour photographs, one (1) of which must be countersigned by

    medical reasons.</p>

    (marked 'ATTACH ONE PHOTO HERE') within the Application Form.</p>
<p>9.6 The countersigned photograph must not be stuck or glued to the form. It can be paper clipped to the form or
    enclosed loose within the envelope.</p>
<p>9.7 Applications received without the two (2) photographs enclosed in the format required will be rejected.</p>
<p>9.8 For applications made via the Yoti App, the photo transferred by Yoti must be usable on the printed card. If it
    is not, for example if the background is not plain, the Applicant will be required to send a usable photo.</p>
<hr class="my-4">
<h2><a id="USE_OF_CARD">10. USE OF CARD</a></h2>
<p>10.1 Although We may issue You with a Card it remains at all times Our legal property. It may only be used by the
    lawful holder of the Card who is the Applicant. The Card may not be lent, sold or given to any other person under
    any circumstances.</p>
<p>10.2 The Card may only be used, by the lawful holder, for the purpose of proving identity or age in order to access
    goods or services where the provider of such goods or services requires evidence of the customer's identity and/or
    age.</p>
<p>10.3 The Card contains a PASS hologram which means that it is endorsed as a valid form of ID and proof of age by the
    government and the police. All national retail trade associations (together representing most of the
    shops, supermarkets, pubs and clubs in the UK) and all airlines recognise the card as valid ID (for domestic
    flights) and proof of age.</p>
<p>However, no guarantee can be given that a particular premise, or individual working at that premise, will acknowledge
    and/or accept the Card as valid ID or proof of age.</p>
<p>10.4 The Company is in no way liable for non-acceptance of a Card under any circumstances. A lawful holder of a Card
    must therefore satisfy themselves that a premise at which they intend to use their Card will acknowledge and accept
    the Card as valid ID and proof of age.</p>
<p>10.5 Under no circumstances will The Company entertain requests for refunded payments in instances where a Card is
    refused. Payments to CitizenCard are made to cover the cost of the Application Processing and Validation Service,
    not for the Card itself which remains at all times the legal property of The Company.</p>
<p>10.6 CitizenCards issued before 7th January 2021 do not expire. All CitizenCards printed from 7th January 2021
    onwards expire 3 years after issuing (rounded up to the end of the month the card was printed on). Cardholders can
    renew
    their membership if their card expired, they wish to obtain a higher age-band card or if their appearance has
    changed. Cardholders can also renew their existing CitizenCard if their name has changed legally since their
    previous CitizenCard was issued. Please note that if cardholder's name was changed legally, a copy of change of name
    deed or marriage certificate or Gender Recognition Certificate must be included with Replacement application.</p>
