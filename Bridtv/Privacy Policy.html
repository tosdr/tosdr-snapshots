<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></h2>

Our customers are businesses that use the BridTV Technology to host, embed, stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the web (collectively, &ldquo;</span><strong>BridTV Services</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BridTV has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a &ldquo;</span><strong>BridTV Website</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), including </span><a href="https://adiq.brid.tv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adiq.brid.tv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://developer.brid.tv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer.brid.tv,</span></a></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> describe the information collection practices of our customers that use BridTV Technology on their Customer Properties. We are a third-party service provider to our customers. We recommend that you refer to our customers&rsquo; privacy policies to learn about their information collection practices.</span></p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BridTV will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted BridTV&rsquo;s new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at </span><a href="https://www.brid.tv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.brid.tv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As used in our discussion about the Corporate Website in this Section A:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>Personal Data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a different definition of Personal Data to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>Tracking Data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cookies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier.

<li><strong> SERVICE PROVIDERS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use third party companies and individuals to provide services and functionality for the Corporate Website.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BridTV uses third-party advertising companies to advertise BridTV and BridTV Services. We allow these service providers to use their tracking technologies on the Corporate Website so that we can target ads about BridTV to you when you are elsewhere on the Internet. This process is sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising.

</ul>

</ul>
<ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Personal Data.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As previously noted, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data &ndash; for example, a visitor&rsquo;s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) &ndash; are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by BridTV Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of BridTV Services or BridTV Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For Users who access the BridTV Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR. The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as &ldquo;</span><strong>data controllers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as &ldquo;</span><strong>data processors</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with BridTV Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data. If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which BridTV Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, if you have concerns about BridTV, you may contact us, at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact@brid.tv</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

</ul>
</ol>
<br />
<ul>
<li>When We May Disclose Usage and Tracking Data.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology for the following purposes:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Service Providers.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To third-party service providers who provide services such as hosting, data analysis, IT infrastructure, IT services, customer service, auditing, security, fraud, and other similar functions to us or our Customers. These third parties have access to User Usage and Tracking Data to perform these tasks on our behalf.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Transfer of Business.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To a third party to which we have transferred our business, assets or stock in the event that BridTV is involved in a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of some or all of our business, assets or stock, including during due diligence related to any such transaction (and also including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we believe appropriate for Compliance Purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<br />
<ul>
<li>To protect an individual user account from accidental deletion, BridTV maintains the deleted data in the system for 30 days. During the retention period, you can restore your account to its state at the time it was deleted. After the retention period has expired, the account and its data is permanently deleted.</li>

<li><strong> USER CHOICES FOR BRIDTV TECHNOLOGY</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For Users who access BridTV Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Certain versions of BridTV Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked. Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser. We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers. However, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that even if a User enables and BridTV recognizes Do Not Track, BridTV Technology will continue to collect Usage Data about each visit to a Customer Property, because Usage Data are automatically sent by the User&rsquo;s web browser. However, the Usage Data will not be associated with any unique identifier, and BridTV Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
