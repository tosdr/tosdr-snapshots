(“<strong>Rev</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) and govern your use of the Services procured through the Rev.com website (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and related desktop or mobile applications (each, an “<strong>App</strong>,” and collectively with the Site, the “<strong>Platform</strong>”). As used in these Terms, “<strong>Services</strong>” means Rev’s transcription, captioning, translation, automated speech recognition (“<strong>ASR</strong>”) and related hosting and other services, including technical support and other services specific to Rev’s and our affiliates’ products and services.</p><p>These Terms, any Order Forms (as defined in Section 3.A (Orders for Services) below), and any policies, conditions and disclaimers referenced in these Terms or otherwise required to access certain features of the Services (the “Additional Terms”) form the “Agreement” between you and us with respect to the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control with respect to the specific feature. In the Agreement, the words “include” and “including” will not be construed as terms of limitation.</p><p>By accessing or using the Services, clicking a button or checking a box indicating acceptance of these Terms, or placing an Order Form, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement, and are legally able to receive the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries in which you are resident or from which you use the Services. Users must be over the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, and of legal age to form a binding contract), and, if a business, duly organized and legally in good standing. Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the Services, whether or not you are a registered User, is described in our <a href="https://www.rev.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Services in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. If you use the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, your acceptance of the Agreement will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and “you” and “your” herein shall refer to that entity, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and all associated Users.</p><ol role="list" class="legal_list-item-numbers"><li><strong>Changes to these Terms<br/>‍</strong>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we materially update any portion of these Terms, we will notify you, at the email address provided in your Account profile, or other reasonable means (for example, by posting a notice on the Site). We will also post the updated Terms on the Platform. Your renewal of your Term (or, for Services without a set Term, your ongoing use of the Services) after we publish or send a notice about changes to these Terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms.</li><li><strong>Accounts</strong><ol role="list" class="legal_list-item-letters"><li><strong>Users</strong>. Users must register an account on the Platform (an “<strong>Account</strong>”) to access certain features of the Services. Users agree to: (a) not share your Account or transfer any part of it to anyone else; (b) provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your Account up-to-date; and (c) keep your password secure and confidential. You agree to notify Rev immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account and are responsible for anything that happens through your Account. Rev is not liable for any losses by any party caused by an unauthorized use of your Account. You agree to keep your contact and billing information (including but not limited to email address) up-to-date, and to comply with all billing procedures, including providing and maintaining accurate and lawful billing information on your Account.</li><li><strong>Account Profile</strong>. You may modify your Account profile and how it interacts with the Services by changing the settings in your Account. You consent to Rev using the email address you provide in your Account profile to send you Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by other means such as postal mail. Rev may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to Services features, special offers, or Services-related newsletters. If you do not want to receive marketing emails, you may opt out or change your preferences by following the instructions on the applicable email message. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements or offers. Even if you opt out of marketing emails, we may still send you administrative emails regarding the Services, including, for example, notices of updates to these Terms or our Privacy Policy, and information related to your Account.</li><li><strong>Account Access. </strong>Customer is responsible for ensuring that access to and use of the Services comports with any limits stated in the applicable Order Form, including by (a) protecting all authentication keys and access tokens for the Services, as applicable, in accordance with the usage limitations; (b) prohibiting access to or use of the Services by anyone other than authorized Users; and (c) ensuring that the authentication keys or access tokens are used solely as necessary to exercise your rights granted under the Agreement. Customer is responsible and liable to Rev for all activity that occurs with the authentication keys, access tokens or otherwise through or in connection with your Account, including any associated User Accounts.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Provision of the Services</strong><ol role="list" class="legal_list-item-letters"><li><strong>Orders for Services</strong>. Services may be procured through the Services interface (or in some cases, via a mutually-executed order form) (each mechanism for procuring Services, an “<strong>Order Form</strong>”). During the Term (as defined in Section 8.A (Term and Renewal) below), Rev grants you a revocable, nonexclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, limited license to (a) access and use the Services described in the applicable Order Form solely in accordance with any usage or license limitations set forth in the Agreement, including the Order Form; (b) install, run and use the Apps on a device that you own and control, in executable, machine-readable, object code form only; and (c) access any and all documentation related to the Services that Rev may make available from time to time (the “<strong>Documentation</strong>”) internally and solely in connection with your authorized use of the Services. You agree that your execution of an Order Form is not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Rev regarding future functionality or features.</li><li><strong>Fees.</strong> Fees for Services (“<strong>Fees</strong>”) are payable by credit card or other payment method permitted by us from time to time, in U.S. dollars (unless another currency is specified in the Order Form), and you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable during the Term as set forth in your Order Form (which includes, for subscription Services, at the start of the applicable billing period specified in your Order Form). You represent and warrant to Rev that all payment information you provide is accurate and that you are authorized to use the applicable payment instrument. You further authorize us to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, Fees for the Term are non-refundable, including in the event of a suspension or termination pursuant to Section 8.B (Termination or Suspension) below, and may only be used for future Services. Customer is responsible for any wire transfer fees.</li><li><strong>Invoicing</strong>. Rev may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Rev thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice, or the Services may be suspended. Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. If you dispute any charges you must provide written notification to Rev within thirty (30) days after the date that Rev invoices you, or such charges shall be deemed valid and due.</li><li><strong>Usage Limitations. </strong>The Services may be subject to certain additional limitations, such as, for example, (a) limits on the number of Users per Customer Account; (b) limits to named (not concurrent) devices or persons; or (c) limits on content storage capacity.

Rev may enhance and modify the Services and introduce new Services from time to time but will not make changes to the Services that materially reduce the functionality you purchased for the Term if a set Term applies to your Services. We reserve the right to change Rev&#x27;s prices at any time without notice. Rev’s pricing will be reflected on the Platform, and your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount; provided, however, that if pricing modifications would negatively impact your then-current Term, e.g., for a subscription-based offering, these modifications will not apply to you until the start of the renewal Term, if any. To the extent Rev makes available any new or different features, functionality or enhancements to the Services, Rev may market these separately and may require the payment of additional fees.

This Agreement will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15.B (Arbitration) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the city of Austin and in Travis County, Texas for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in Section 15.B (Arbitration) below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Travis County, Texas is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</li><li><strong>Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM REV.</strong> This Section 15.B (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Rev that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Rev, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“<strong>Claim</strong>” or collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). The Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement. If you are a new Rev user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Rev at support@rev.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought. For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at finance@rev.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Rev has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas, unless you and Rev agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Rev agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, or any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel. Nothing in this Section will be deemed as: preventing Rev from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</li><li><strong>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND REV AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER REV USERS. YOU AND REV FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND REV ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</strong></li></ol></li><li><strong>Trade Restrictions. </strong>You acknowledge that the Services and any related products, information, documentation, software, technology, technical data, and any derivatives thereof, that Rev makes available (collectively “<strong>Excluded Data</strong>”) are subject to the export control and sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries that may prohibit or restrict access by certain persons or from certain countries or territories currently including, but not limited to, Cuba, the Crimea region of the Ukraine, Sudan, Iran, North Korea and Syria (&quot;<strong>Trade Restrictions</strong>”).
