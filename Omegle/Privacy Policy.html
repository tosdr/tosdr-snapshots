<h1>Omegle Privacy Notice</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2022-10-27</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices of Omegle.com LLC (“<strong>Omegle</strong>”) and applies to all visitors of the Omegle website and users of the Omegle chat service ("you").</p>
<h2>Information Omegle Collects</h2>
<p>At the end of an Omegle chat, you or the other user may choose to save the text contents of the chat to Omegle’s servers (a “<strong>Saved Chatlog</strong>”). A URL is generated for each Saved Chatlog. <strong>A Saved Chatlog may contain any category of personal information you chose to share during the chat. You and the other user may disclose a Saved Chatlog or any information shared during the chat. In addition to the Saved Chatlog, it is possible for the other user to take screenshots or use third party software to broadcast or record chats. Be careful with the information you share with a stranger during a chat.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to any information contained in a Saved Chatlog, within the last twelve (12) months, Omegle has collected the following categories of personal information from the following sources and disclosed for a business purpose to the following third parties:</p>

<h2>Video Chat</h2>
<p>Omegle video chat service requires a direct connection to be made between your computer and the other user's computer. To do this, it is necessary to make your IP address available to the other user's computer, although it is not shown to the other user by Omegle's interface. This is a necessary part of how any P2P video chat system functions. If you are not comfortable with this, use text mode (or spy mode) instead.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Omegle and its third-party service providers use cookies, tokens, widgets or other similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) for certain features of the chat services to function. The Cookies collect personal information as follows.</p>
<p>Omegle uses an ID Cookie to randomly assign your device browser an online identifier. Omegle uses the online identifier for website and chat services safety and security purposes.</p>
<p>Omegle uses Interest Cookies which allow you to save your interests and preferences while using the chat services. When you request to start a chat using the common interest feature, information from an Interest cookie is sent to Omegle and used to locate another user with overlapping interests. The set of matching interests between you and the other user will be disclosed to both users at the beginning of your chat. Except for the set of overlapping interests captured in a Saved Chatlog, Omegle does not save information from Interest cookies and only accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling requests to chat using the common interest feature.</p>
<p>Omegle uses College Cookies which allow you to save your preferences when using college mode and identifies your college’s domain name if you choose to use college mode. Your college domain name will be disclosed to the other user in your chat. Except for disclosure of your college domain name captured in a Saved Chatlog, Omegle does not save information from College Cookies and only accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling request to chat using the college mode feature.</p>
<p>Omegle uses Language Cookies which allow you to be matched with users with the same language preference. Omegle does not save the information from Language Cookies and only accesses the information for the purpose of matching you with users with the same language preference.</p>
<p>Omegle uses an Auto-reroll Cookie which allows you to save your preference enabling or disabling the auto-rerolling function while using video chat services. Omegle does not save the information from the Auto-reroll Cookie and only accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling your request to enable or disable the auto-rerolling function while using video chat services.</p>
<p>Omegle uses CAPTCHA technology to prevent spam and block bots to protect the security and safety of the site and chat services. For more information about how the CAPTCHA technology collects and processes information, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/overview">please click here</a>.</p>
<p>Omegle uses Google Translate to allow you to translate the site content into different languages. For more information about how Google Translate collects and processes information, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">please click here</a>.</p>
<p>Omegle uses Google Analytics to track anonymous statistical information about site and chat services usage. Omegle uses the statistical usage information to maintain and enhance the safety, security, and functionality of the site and services. For more information on how Google Analytics collects and processes information, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">please click here</a>.</p>
<p>You can use your browser settings to maintain control over information collected through cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to access all functionality available through the site and chat services and certain features will not work properly.</p>
<h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Omegle may use, or disclose the personal information Omegle collects for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, to provide the chat service.</li>
<li>To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of Omegle’s site and chat services. For example, Omegle may screen and use the information to protect against spammers, hackers, and others who pose harm to the site and services; Omegle may share information with moderation service providers; and Omegle may share the information with law enforcement.</li>
<li>To evaluate and improve the site and services. For example, Omegle may aggregate and/or de-identify information to produce statistical data such as the average number of chats started at different times of day.</li>
<li>To monitor and enforce user compliance with Omegle’s <a href="/static/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> and policies. For example, Omegle may share information with its moderation service providers; use automated systems to screen information for suspicious activity; and share the information with law enforcement.</li>
<li>To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.</li>
<li>To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Omegle's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Omegle about our site and services users is among the assets transferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Omegle will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>
<h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
<p>Omegle may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When Omegle discloses personal information for a business purpose, Omegle enters a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
<p>In addition to the service providers identified in the Cookie Section above, Omegle uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> for hosting services, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> for Saved Chatlog storage services, and <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for content delivery network services. Please click on the service provider link to find information about their respective services and privacy practices.</p>
<h2>Sales of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Omegle does not exchange your personal information for money. Like many other sites, Omegle had a Facebook “like” button, Facebook “comments” plugin, Pinterest “pin” button, reddit “share” button, VK “share” button, and a Twitter “tweet” button embedded on the site. The use of these buttons and plugins may have constituted a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. The buttons and plugins are no longer used. To the extent that the use of these buttons and plugins constituted a sale of personal information, in the preceding twelve (12) months, Omegle used the buttons and plugins which allowed the internet or other similar network activity category of personal information to be shared with Facebook, Pinterest, reddit, VK, and Twitter.</p>
