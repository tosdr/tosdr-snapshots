            <p>Company Employees, irrespective of the position they hold, are personally liable for observance of the principles and requirements of this Policy and the Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws, as well as for the actions (inactions) of the persons subordinate to them who violate these principles and requirements.</p>
            <h4>4. Specific issues related to Anti-Corruption Compliance</h4>
            <h4>4.1. Contractual compliance controls</h4>
            <p>In the cases designated by the Company's policies, contracts entered into by the Company with third parties must envisage the obligations of those parties to observe the Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws (the anti-corruption clause), according to the wordings approved by the Company. Furthermore, the contracts must specify the right of the Company to effect immediate unilateral termination in the event of a breach of the obligations specified by the anti-corruption clause.</p>
            <p>In the cases designated by the Company's policies, contracts which the Company enters into with third parties likewise must envisage the right of the Company to carry out an audit of financial and other documentation pertaining to the implementation of the relevant contract.</p>
            <h4>4.2. Due diligence of business partners and Employees</h4>
            <p>The Company shall apply reasonable efforts to minimize risks associated with interaction with any third parties, including business, labor and any other relationships with individuals or legal entities.</p>
            <p>For this purpose, the Company has developed and maintains procedures for inspection in relation to Employees and business partners (legal entities and individuals), and with whom the Company plans to enter into a contract. In addition, the Company carries out periodical due diligence of business partners with which it has entered into long-term contracts (lasting longer than one year).</p>
            
            <p>The due diligence procedure in respect of the business partners and Employees has the following goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>assessment of the necessity of hiring a business partner, Employee, the purposes of this hiring in comparison to similar transactions of the Company;</li>
              <li>assessment of the overall reputation of the Employee or a business partner, its owners and key persons for compliance with the Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws;</li>
              <li>finding out whether any violations of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws have been committed in the past;</li>
              <li>establishing whether the potential Employee or a business partner has any connections to Government Officials and Government Entities, which might influence obtainment by the business partner or the Company of improper commercial advantages;</li>
              <li>assessment of the impact of these connections on the legality of entering into the contract with the business partner from the point of view of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws;</li>
              <li>assessment of commercial reasonableness and arm’s-length basis for a proposed transaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any Anti-Corruption Compliance red flags raised during the course of the due diligence review must be addressed to the satisfaction of the local compliance manager before formally entering into, or continuing, the relationship.</p>
            <p>The statements in this clause 4.2 of the Policy extend also to contractors under transactions for merger, acquisition, or creation of joint ventures, and so forth. Moreover, also subject to due diligence are legal entities, ownership stakes or rights of control (direct or indirect) of which the Company acquires as a result of the transaction.</p>
            <h4>4.3. Gifts and hospitality expenses</h4>
            <p>The Company’s business decisions and those of its partners must be made objectively, without influence by gifts or favors. A small, reasonably priced gift or gesture of gratitude may sometimes be an appropriate way for business people to display respect for each other. Nevertheless, regardless of value, the giving or receipt of a gift, meal, entertainment, or other hospitality benefit must not be done with the intent to improperly influence a Government Official or any other party doing business with the Company.</p>
            <p>Any gifts and hospitality expenses of the Company (gifts which Employees and Agents of the Company may give on behalf of and/or at the expense of the Company to other individuals or legal entities, or which Employees, in connection with their work at the Company, may receive from other parties, as well as the corresponding hospitality expenses) must be in conformity with the following criteria:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>is not made with the intent to influence the recipient in order to obtain or retain any improper business advantage for the Company or any other individual or entity, or as an explicit or implicit exchange for favors or benefits, or for any other corrupt purpose;</li>
              <li>must not be prohibited by Anti-Corruption Laws applicable to the Company and recipient;</li>
              <li>must not affect the capability of the recipient to make impartial and fair decisions in connection with the official powers he or she has been entrusted with, nor must it impose any moral obligation on the recipient;</li>
              <li>must not constitute hidden remuneration for the obtainment of improper commercial advantage, including any service, action, omission or decision, and likewise must not represent an attempt to exert influence on the recipient with another illegal or unethical goal;</li>
              <li>must be reasonably justified and not be a luxury item separately or jointly, if gifts or payments are made to a person more than once;</li>
              <li>must not create for the Company risks to its reputation in the event of disclosure of information on such gifts or hospitality expenses;</li>
              <li>must not contravene the principles and requirements of this Policy and other policies of the Company in the area of Anti-Corruption Compliance;</li>
              <li>must be offered and accepted in a transparent manner and not be solicited;</li>
              <li>must undergo the approval procedures established within the Company.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The indicated criteria shall also be applied to expenses on organization on behalf and/or at the expense of the Company of events aimed at attraction, retention or development of clients, as well as events related to communicating with the public, the mass media, and professional society.</p>
            <p>Before the completion of any payment or donation of any gift in an amount exceeding (jointly during one-year period or separately) 100 USD to any third party, including to a Government Official, on behalf and/or at the expense of the Company, the Employee must contact the local compliance manager and provide detailed information about the proposed gift or other paid expenses in order to receive confirmation about the legality and admissibility of such payment or gift. Symbolic gifts, such as pens or calendars bearing the Company's logo, do not require the prior approval of the compliance manager.</p>
            <p>The compliance managers shall be entitled to block transfer of the gift or payment of expenses if he or she establishes that such actions do not comply with the criteria set forth above, or create risks of violation of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws for the Company.</p>
            <p>It is not permitted to give gifts on behalf of the Company, Employees and Agents of the Company to any third parties in the form of monetary funds, whether cash or not, as well as any of their equivalents (for example, checks, gift cards, securities and so forth). Also, as a general rule, it is never permissible to pay for air fare and travel for spouses, other family members or other guests of Government Officials or any other third party.</p>
            <p>Employees are entitled to accept small gifts and payment of hospitality expenses of modest value from third parties with which the Employees interact in the course of work for the Company, subject to the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the acceptance of the gift or payment of hospitality expenses will not create for the Employee a conflict of interests in regard to his or her official duties in the Company and will not affect the performance thereof;</li>
              <li>the Employee believes in good faith that the giver has no intention of affecting in some way the performance by the Employee of his or her official duties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Employees must not solicit or request gifts. Employees are obligated to inform the compliance manager if they receive any gifts or payment of expenses by third parties for an amount greater than 100 USD (or the quality of that sum in local currency).</p>
            <h4>4.4. Retaining Government Officials</h4>
            <p>It may be justified to retain a current or former Government Official as an Employee or a business partner of the Company. However, doing so must be handled with caution. Such relationships must be structured so that they meet the requirements of the Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and other applicable laws of relevant jurisdictions, and must not create a conflict of interest for the Government Official. No such relationship may be negotiated or agreed to without the prior approval of the compliance manager.</p>
            <h4>4.5. Sponsorship and corporate social responsibility</h4>
            <p>In accordance with this Policy and other implemented procedures, the Company does not finance and does not participate in any other form in charitable and/or sponsorship activities for the purpose of receiving any illegal privileges or preferences in connection with business activity.</p>
            <p>All of the Company's financial operations associated with sponsorship or charitable activity are recorded in detail and in a trustworthy manner in the accounting records; the project being realized undergo coordination in advance; the monitoring procedures for charitable contributions allow one to be convinced with a reasonable degree of certainty that the contributions made do not constitute a concealed form of bribery.</p>
            <p>Before the Company or an Employee of the Company makes on behalf and/or at the expense of the Company any donation for an amount greater than 100 USD, it is necessary to consult with the compliance manager, who is entitled to block payment after performing the appropriate due diligence for compliance with Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.</p>
            <h4>4.6. Financing of political activity</h4>
            <p>The Company does not finance and does not support or encourage in any other way political parties or members thereof, including candidates for political positions, their election campaigns or political events, nor any political organizations or movements.</p>
            <h4>4.7. Payments through intermediaries in favor of third parties</h4>
            <p>The Company, its Employees and Agents are forbidden to engage any third parties for the commission of any actions that contravene the principles and requirements of this Policy or the standards of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws. Such actions by third parties may expose the Company even if they have no actual knowledge or awareness.</p>
            <p>The Company, its Employees and Agents are forbidden to make payments in favor of third parties, if there exists suspicion that all or part of this payment will be used to bribe a Government Official or an agent or employee of a commercial organization.</p>
            <p>The Company ensures inspection of the reasonability and justification of payments or any other provisions to third parties for the prevention and/or discovery of the violations described above for purposes of minimizing the risks of involving the Company in corrupt activities. All commercial relationships with third-party intermediaries must be approved by the compliance manager, and all relationships must be put in the form of a written agreement.</p>
            <h4>4.8. Facilitating Payments</h4>
            <p>The Policy prohibits “facilitating payments,” i.e., unofficial payments provided in order to receive or expedite (speed up) a routine government action, i.e., actions which are ordinarily and commonly performed by Government Officials (e.g., processing governmental papers, such as permits, visas, etc.).</p>
            <h4>4.9. Books and records</h4>
            <p>Employees or Agents are not allowed to conclude on behalf of the Company any transactions with fraudulent intent or with knowledge of the fact that the transaction or payment differs from the description in the documents confirming or justifying the transaction or payment.</p>
            <p>For implementation of this prohibition, all financial operations, accounting postings and entries must be credibly recorded with a sufficient level of detail in the Company's books and records, and be documented and accessible for inspection.</p>
            <p>Any payments to the third-party Agents should be made to bank accounts held by such Agent in the country in which the relevant goods or services were provided or the country where the Agent is registered. Any expenses for which reimbursement is requested by an Employee or Agent of the Company, as well as any expenses of the Company performed using cash resources, must be confirmed in documentary form using proper primary documentation, including original receipts, invoices or other relevant documents. Any requests for expense reimbursements must be approved by the supervisor of the Employee requesting payment.</p>
            <h4>4.10. Audit and control</h4>
            <p>On a regular basis, the Company carries out internal and external audits of its financial and business activities, and also carries out ongoing control over the completeness and accuracy of the recording of all business operations in the books and records and observance of the requirements of applicable legislation and the Company's internal normative documents, including the principles and requirements established by this Policy.</p>
            <p>As part of the internal control procedures at the Company, inspections are carried out into the discipline of implementing the established procedure for performance of business processes, including inspection into the legality of the operations undertaken involving the Company's assets and their economic justification, the advisability of expenses, including for confirmation by primary accounting documents and conformity with the requirements of this Policy.</p>
            <h4>4.11. Informing about violations</h4>
            <p>Every Employee and Agent of the Company who has become aware of facts (or of signs pointing to them) regarding a violation or inclination to violate the provisions of this Policy and/or Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws by Employees or Agents of the Company, as well as by third parties, must inform about it in any of the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>by informing the direct supervisor or, if such communication concerns the actions of the direct supervisor, to a higher ranking supervisor,</li>
              <li>via the Company's "Hotline" or by sending a message directly to this address: nocorrupt@kaspersky.com, which can be done anonymously as well (from an outside email address),</li>
              <li>by informing the Chief Compliance Manager of the Company or a local compliance manager.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Within the limits of its powers, the Company shall undertake to ensure the protection of Employees who have conscientiously reported a violation or suspicion of a violation of the provisions of this Policy and/or Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws from persecution or any other form of discrimination on the part of the party in relation to whom the report was made.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Company guarantees that none of its Employees will be held responsible (by being dismissed, demoted, deprived of a bonus, and so forth) by the Company if the Employee reported the presumed corruption in good faith, or if the Employee refused to give or take a bribe or render mediation in acts of bribery, including if such refusal results in foregone profit for the Company, or no commercial or competitive advantages were gained. Retaliation may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
            <p>The Company's guarantees to refuse to hold Employees accountable do not extend to guilty Employees, nor to cases when an internal investigation proves that the report in question was deliberately false, or constituted perjury or libel.</p>
            <h4>5. Liability</h4>
            <p>Inasmuch as the Company may be held liable for the participation of Employees and Agents of the Company and other parties associated with it in corrupt activities, for each justified suspicion or established instance of corruption, internal investigations will be undertaken in accordance with the Company's rules establishing the procedure for carrying out such an investigation in a context permitted by applicable legislation.</p>
            <p>Parties guilty of breaching this Policy and of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws may face disciplinary, administrative, civil law or criminal liability at the initiative of the Company, the law enforcement authorities, or other entities in the procedure and on the grounds specified by the Company's Charter, internal procedures, and also in the appropriate cases and given sufficient grounds, in accordance with Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
