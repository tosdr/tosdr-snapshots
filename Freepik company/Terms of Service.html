                        <p>Should any conflict arise between the content of the terms as they are laid out below and the content of the specific terms of use of each Website or Service (displayed above), the specific terms of use of each Website or Service shall always prevail.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-xl">Registration</h4>

                        <p>In order to use certain Services, the User must register, creating a username and password and activating an account. To this end, the User must provide a valid email address where the User will receive notifications related to the Services. If the User is a legal entity or business, its username must be its full name or corporate name and the person registering on behalf of the legal entity or business declares that he/she is duly authorized to bind such legal entity or business and that such legal entity or business shall be bound to the terms of the relevant Website/Service.</p>

                        <p>The User agrees to provide the mandatory information required for registration and also acknowledges that such information is true, complete and up to date. The User is solely responsible for keeping such information updated. Should the User provide false, outdated or incomplete information, or should the Company have reasons to suspect it, the Company reserves the right to suspend or cancel the User’s account.</p>

                        <p>The User must protect and keep the account password confidential and must not disclose it to third parties. The User must neither allow other Users to access the Services through the User’s account nor use the account of another User to access the Services.</p>

                        <p>The User is responsible for all operations carried out through the User’s account through any device. If the User suspects that another User is using his account, he/she/it should immediately inform the Company.</p>

                        <p>The Company may suspend or cancel the User’s account if it considers that the User has breached these terms.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-xl">Liability</h4>

                        <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that he/she/it uses the Website and its Services at the User’s own risk and under the User’s responsibility and, therefore, the Company does not accept any responsibility for misuse or use in breach of the terms of the relevant Web Site/Service.</p>

                        <p>The User will be responsible for any damages to the Company resulting from the User’s use of the Website and the Services in breach of the terms and accepts to indemnify the Company and its directors, employees, agents and representatives from any liability in which they may incur as a result of the User’s breach of these terms.</p>

                        <p>The Company does not warrant the availability or continuity of the Website or the Services, neither its reliability, quality, completeness, accuracy or whether they are fit for a specific purpose or activity.</p>

                        <p>As way of example and without limitation, the Company shall not be liable for any damages that may result from:</p>

                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Interruptions, viruses, technical problems, interferences, omissions, unavailability, power cuts, failure of the telecommunication networks or the User’s equipment which are not the Company’s responsibility.</li>
                            <li>Delays or unavailability of the Website and the Services due to deficiencies or traffic overload on the Internet, in the communication network or the electricity grid.</li>
                            <li>Third-party actions.</li>
                            <li>Unavailability of the Website and the Services due to maintenance or software updates.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p class="uppercase">Save for the company’s wilful misconduct, and those cases in which due to the specific circumstances of the user involved or the nature of the matter, applicable law provides that liability cannot be limited by agreement, use of the website and the services is at sole risk of the user and the company shall not be liable for any damage of any kind caused to the user as a result of using the website and/or the services.</p>

                        <p>Regarding contents owned by third parties, whether sponsored or otherwise (if any), the Company acts exclusively as a provider of a search service as requested by the User, without assuming any responsibility for search results.</p>

                        <p>The insertion of links in the Services does not imply any relationship, recommendation or supervision by the Company of the linked website and, accordingly, the Company does not accept any liability in relation to the content of any linked website except in the specific circumstances provided by applicable law.</p>

                        <p>Regarding content owned by third parties and offered through the Websites and/or Services in collaboration with the Company (if any), the Company acts exclusively as the provider of the intermediation service between the third parties’ offer of content and the Users interested in downloading them, without any liability in relation to such contents, except for those cases expressly stated by the applicable law.</p>

                        <p>The Company will make reasonable commercial efforts in order to ensure the accuracy of keywords and descriptions, as well as the identification of content as exclusively for editorial use or any equivalent expression. However, <span class="uppercase">the company neither warrants nor makes any representation regarding any keyword, title or description; or the identification or lack of identification of any visual content as exclusively for editorial use</span>. For this reason and notwithstanding any other liability limitation that may be applicable in accordance with these terms, the Company shall neither indemnify nor assume any liability in connection with any claim resulting from inaccurate keywords, titles or descriptions, or from the use of the visual content identified as exclusively for editorial use.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-xl">Intellectual Property</h4>

                        <p>All intellectual property rights over the Website, the Services, its design, and source code, and all content included in any of them (including without limitation text, images, animations, databases, graphics, logos, trademarks, icons, buttons, pictures, videos, sound recordings, etc.) belong or are licensed to the Company.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-xl">Changes and Closure of the Website</h4>

However, the Company will comply with its obligations regarding the keeping of records in relation to certain transactions for the relevant period as provided by applicable law or refund the Users of Subscriptions in force at that time with the proportional part of the price not accrued before the termination.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-xl">General and Contact Information</h4>

                        <p>The use of the Website and the Services and the interpretation and application of these terms shall be governed by Spanish Law.

                            <p>The terms in this Section ("<strong>Teams Plan Terms</strong>") govern any purchase of the Teams Plan on the Website, which allows an administrator user (the “<strong>Administrator User</strong>”) to purchase and manage several end-user accounts collectively, giving access to the accounts (“<strong>Seats</strong>”) to different end-users (the “<strong>Teams End-Users</strong>”).</p>
                            <p>When concluding the purchase procedure for any Teams Plan, it shall be deemed that the Administrator User has read and accepted, without exception, the Teams Plan Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Teams Plan Terms extend the Terms, which will continue to apply in full force to the Administrator Users who have acquired a Teams Plan, and to all Teams Plan End Users, unless otherwise stated in provisions of the Teams Plan Terms.</p>
                            <p>These Teams Plan Terms are available to the Administrator User before purchasing the Teams Plan and may be stored or reproduced on a durable medium.</p>
                            <p>The Teams Plan Terms are available in English and Spanish. In case the Administrator User is interested in purchasing any Teams Plan, she/he has to follow the instructions available on the Website from time to time.</p>
                            <p>The plans and subscriptions available are offered on the Website where the relevant information, price, and conditions are included (including, without limitation, restrictions on the daily download allowance). The Company can modify the plan and subscriptions offered at any time, offering with new Services or ceasing to offer any of the Services.</p>
                            <p>The price for the Teams Plan, depending on how many Teams End-Users Seats are requested by the Administrator User, is stated in the relevant currency on the Website and includes, if applicable, the appropriate Value Added Tax. The Company is entitled to modify the price for any Plan or subscription at any time. The Company shall apply the price stated on the Website at the time of submitting the Plan order by the Administrator User.</p>
                            <p>The Administrator User shall pay the Teams Plan in advance through Paypal, credit/debit card, Direct Debit, or any other valid payment method offered by the Company, as stated on the Website. The processing of the payment information and data through Paypal, credit/debit card, or Direct Debit is made through third-party sites. When ordering any Teams Plan, the Administrator User authorizes the Company to collect the corresponding price through the chosen payment method. The Teams Plan shall not be activated until the Company has received the payment or the payment has been authorized by the relevant financing entity. After that, the Teams Plan shall be in force for the term purchased by the User.</p>

The Company shall charge the corresponding price by the same initial payment method. The Company may modify the price for the renewal of the Teams Plan, provided that the Administrator User is informed with, at least, one-month prior notice, via email sent to the email address used for the registration process.</p>

                            <p>Once the Administrator User purchases the Teams Plan, the system shall confirm the purchase, and the Teams Administrator Account will be created. Once the Teams Administrator Account is created, the Administrator User may activate different Teams End-Users accounts, limited to the number of Seats contracted (for the avoidance of doubt, the Administrator User’s account shall be counted as one among the contracted Seats, notwithstanding that the Administrator User may leave his/her Seat vacant to be used by another Teams End User for accessing and using the Services exclusively. In no case Teams End-User will assume any of the Administrator User’s obligations regarding this clause). In order to access their Seats, each End User must either log in to the Website using the email address indicated by the Administrator User, or create a User account on the Website using said email address.</p>
                            <p>End Users who have an active Premium Subscription associated with the email address indicated by the Administrator User will not be able to access their Seat. In this case, they will have to log in using another User account, or register on the Website using another email address.</p>
                            <p>Any Teams End-User Account is personal and non-transferable, and it is expressly forbidden to share any Teams End-User Account with any other Teams End-User or third parties. Failing to comply with this obligation will entitle Freepik to terminate the Terms immediately.</p>
                            <p>The Administrator User will have the ability to access all Teams End-User Accounts, including the ability to assign, un-assign, access, monitor, use, modify or access any data available to Teams End-Users associated with their Teams End-User accounts.</p>
                            <p>The Administrator User is solely responsible for</p>

                                <li>authorizing as End-Users of his or her Teams Plan exclusively those individuals with whom the Administrator User has a personal or professional relationship in which both the invitation to collaborate and the subsequent monitoring are reasonable and within the legitimate expectations of the invitees;</li>
                                <li>informing all Teams End User in detail of the authorized use of the Teams End-Users accounts according to these Terms and the Service Specific Terms;</li>
                                <li>the fair access and use of the Services in compliance with these Terms (including Teams End-Users); and</li>
                                <li>all activities regarding its Teams Plan account regardless of whether the activities are undertaken by Administrator User or Teams End-Users.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>After purchasing the Teams Plan, both the Administrator User and the Teams End-Users may benefit from the same benefits as the Premium User, as described in Clause 10.</p>
                            <p>The rest of the Terms, including the conditions established or referred to in Clauses 7, 8 and 9, will continue to apply, such as, without limitation, the prohibited uses for Freepik Content.</p>
                            <p>As the content in the Website is digital by nature, no cancellation right shall apply, which is expressly acknowledged and accepted by the Administrator User, without prejudice to the guarantees stated in the consumers’ regulations that may be applicable, unless the Company states otherwise, in which case, will be subject to the conditions set forth by the Company.</p>

In this case, they will have to log in using another User account, or register on the Website using a different email address than the one associated with a Premium Subscription.</li>
                                <li>For Guest Users who are minors according to the regulations of their country of residence, the Administrator User shall create, for each Guest User, an anonymous and generic username (not a name) under which the Guest User may access the Service. If the Administrator allows Guest Users who are minors to use the Service, the Customer shall inform and collect all necessary parental consent for Guest Users to use the Service. Guest User Accounts are set up to be anonymous so that the Company need not (and the Guest User may not) enter or communicate any personal data. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company does not have access to the personal data of Guest Users who are minors and therefore cannot determine the age of Guest Users. This responsibility lies with the User Administrator. The Company may at any time request proof of such consent(s) from the Administrator User. In this case, the Company only retains the IP address of Guest Users who have access to the Service in order to properly manage the security of the Services (from cyber attacks, usage violations, etc.) and to control that no Guest User account is shared with third parties or that the Guest User's use of his/her account complies with these Terms. By themselves, IP addresses do not in any way allow the Company to identify the Guest User. After the end of the Term, Freepik Company will block and delete all information collected from Guest User accounts.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Any Seat is personal and non-transferable, and it is expressly forbidden to share any Guest User Seat with any other Guest User or third party. Failure to comply with this obligation shall entitle the Company to terminate the Terms immediately.</p>
                            <p>The Administrator User shall have the ability to access all Guest User Seats, including the ability to assign, unassign, access, monitor, use, modify, or access any data available to Guest Users associated with their Guest User Seats.</p>
                            <p>The Administrator User is solely responsible for</p>

                                <li>authorise as Guest Users only those persons with whom the Administrator User has a personal or professional relationship in which both the invitation to collaborate and the subsequent follow-up are reasonable and within the legitimate expectations of the invitees;</li>
                                <li>to inform all Guest Users in detail about the authorised use of Guest User Seats in accordance with these Terms;</li>
                                <li>access to and fair use of the Services in accordance with these Terms (including Guest User activity); and</li>
                                <li>all activities relating to your Administrator User account and contracted Seats, regardless of whether the actions are performed by the Administrator User or Guest Users.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Both the Administrator User and the Guest Users may benefit from the same advantages as the Premium User, as described in Clause 8.</p>
                            <p>All other Conditions, including the conditions set out or referred to in Clauses 6 and 7, shall continue to apply, such as, without limitation, the prohibited uses for the Slidesgo Content.</p>
                            <p>As it is digital content, no right of withdrawal is applicable, which is expressly accepted by the User Administrator, without prejudice to the guarantees established in the consumer and user regulations which, where applicable, may be applicable, unless the Company indicates otherwise, instead, it shall be subject to the conditions established by the Company.</p>
