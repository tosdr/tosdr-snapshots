Our products facilitate specific functionality and provide ease of access to information and widgets that can be accessed from the new tab, start page and/or via browser search settings.</p>
        <p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of persons ("you(r)") who visit, access our website, download, install and/or use our browser extensions/add-ons (the "Extension") for search applications installed on your computer or mobile device.</p>
        <p>This document describes our obligations under applicable data protections laws, and explains what type of information we are collecting and how we are using this information.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">1. What information we process:</h3>
        <p>In the course of browsing our websites, installing our products and using our product, we capture the following:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
            Information necessary to the proper functioning of the Extension. Based on the Extension's functionality, we may collect certain types of information that you explicitly provide to us. The type of information depends on the specific Extension but may include package tracking numbers, flight information and routes, and (on a temporary basis and in no case for more than seven days) certain files you choose to upload. Other types of information necessary to the Extension may be collected but stored only on your computer (i.e., we do not store it on our server). This latter category depends on the specific Extension but may include your astrological sign, your reminders and to-do lists, your recipe search terms and recipes, and your map search queries.                      
            </li>

            <li>
            Automatically-captured information. Apart from the types of information listed above, we automatically collect information from you in order to optimize the Extension.

When we process personal information of users, we generally rely on the consent that we obtained. We may rely on our legitimate interest to process certain business or employment information.
