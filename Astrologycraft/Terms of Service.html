            <h3 class="section-title">1. INSTALLATION </h3>
            <p>By downloading the Extension, you are installing a software application that will change your internet
                browser settings. The Extension is designed to enhance your internet searches and provide additional
                features. As such, the Extension may reset your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or
                default search settings. If you do not want to reset any of these settings, you can choose not to
                install the Extension, decline or opt-out of one or more settings, or discontinue use of the Extension
                entirely. You may also choose to customize certain search-related and non-search-related features. Use
                of the Extension, regardless of what settings you choose or decline, is subject to our Privacy Policy,
                which is specifically incorporated by reference into this Terms of Service as though fully set forth herein. If you
                are or become a resident of the European Union, you agree not to access the website, download or
                install, or discontinue use of and/or uninstall the extension.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-title">2. GRANT OF LICENSE</h3>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with this Terms of Service, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable,
                non-sublicensable, non-transferable license, to access, download and install the most current version
                of the Extension (including all updates) solely for your lawful, personal, and non-commercial use.

            <p>Restricted Use. Without limiting the license in Section 2, you are explicitly prohibited (either
                directly or indirectly) from (i) selling, leasing, sharing, sublicensing, distributing, assigning,
                copying (other than a single copy for backup), transferring or using the Extension for the benefit of

                permission from the owner of that computer; (iii) using any automatic or manual device, robot, spider
                or other process to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper function of the Extension; (iv)

                using the Extension in any fraudulent or unlawful manner, including, without limitation, by defacing,
                degrading or impeding the Extension or us; (viii) using the Extension in any way which violates or may
                be used to violate any applicable law; (ix) using the Extension in any way which interferes with anyone
                else’s use of the Extension; (x) accessing, creating or modifying (“Modification(s)”) the source code
                of the Extension; and/or (xii) creating derivative works (“Derivative Work(s)”) comprised of the
                Extension. All Modifications or Derivative Works shall remain the sole property of us.

            </p>
            <p>Mobile Installations. Using your mobile device to access the Extension may cause your network or mobile
                service provider to charge you messaging, data and other rates and/or fees. To the extent your mobile
                service provider notifies you that you are prohibited from downloading, installing and/or using the
                Extension, you agree to discontinue use of and uninstall the Extension. You acknowledge that the
                Extension may not function properly with all mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-title">4. AUTHORIZED INFORMATION PROCESSING AND STORAGE</h3>
            <p>We, our affiliates, vendors and/or service providers may collect and transfer information about you.,
                though we do not collect information that personally identifies you. (For more information on the type
                of information we collect, please refer to our Privacy Policy.) In some cases, your information may
                cross borders from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
                If you are located in a region outside the United States with laws governing data collection and use
                that may differ from U.S. law, you agree that such information is collected, stored and used in the
                United States and that U.S. law shall apply. By downloading, registering for and/or using the
                Extension, you consent to the transfer of information under the laws of the United States irrespective
                of any country in which you are a citizen or resident. This transfer is governed by the posted Privacy
                Policy.

                be provided in connection with third-party services, feeds and/or content. All products, services,
                feeds, websites and other content, including without limitation, all data, links, articles, graphic or
                video messages, information, text, software, music, sound, graphics or other materials made available
                or accessible through the Extension (“Third-Party Materials”) are the sole responsibility of the entity
                or person from whom they originated. Third-Party Materials may be subject to separate Terms of Service
                and privacy policies. You acknowledge that, by using the Extension, (i) you may be exposed to
                Third-Party Material that is offensive, indecent or objectionable; (ii) we do not endorse any
                Third-Party Material; (iii) we do not bear any responsibility or liability for Third-Party Material;

            <p>We use industry and proprietary technical standards to preserve the confidentiality of information we
                collect. However, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we do not guarantee the security

                YOUR ACCOUNT OR ANY OTHER BREACH OF SECURITY KNOWN TO YOU.

                <li> A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the Subject Material in

                Material, provided the counter-notification includes substantially the following:

                    Material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the Subject
                    Material;</li>

            <p>No Waiver. No failure or delay on our part to exercise any right or remedy under this Terms of Service shall operate
                or be deemed as a waiver of any such right or remedy.</p>
            <p>Governing Law; Forum Selection. This Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State
                of New York, without regard to conflicts or choice of law principles. Except as otherwise noted, all
                claims arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the
                Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in the
                State of New York, or in such other place as may be mutually agreed between us and you (collectively,
                the “Parties”) and shall be heard by a panel of one arbitrator mutually acceptable to the Parties or,
                if the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the
                rules of JAMS. The decisions and awards of an arbitrator regarding any dispute shall be (i) final and
                valid, non-appealable, and binding upon the Parties, and (ii) enforceable in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. In the event that any dispute arising under, in connection, or with respect to this Terms of Service
                is resolved by arbitration, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing
                party the fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable fees and expenses of
                counsel) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with, or as a result of, such dispute. In
                addition, the non-prevailing party shall pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.</p>
            <p>Complete Understanding; Severability. This Terms of Service, including the Privacy Policy which is specifically
                incorporated by reference, constitutes the final and complete agreement between the Parties regarding
                the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous communications, representations
                or agreements between the Parties, whether oral or written. If any provision of this Terms of Service is found
                invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be amended
                to achieve as nearly as possible our original intentions, and the remainder of this Terms of Service shall remain
                in full force and effect. </p>
            <p>Class Action Waiver. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL
                RIGHTS. The Parties agree that all disputes, claims or controversies shall be brought and resolved on
                an individual basis, and that any disputes, claims, and controversies arising out of or relating to the
                Extension (including, but not limited to, your access and/or use of the same or the handling of
                information collected) or this Terms of Service (including, but not limited to, its validity or enforceability)
                will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class,
                consolidated, or representative proceeding. The Parties further agree that neither we nor you shall
                participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by
                any third party arising out of or relating to the Extension (including, but not limited to, your access
                and/or use of the same or the handling of information collected) or this Terms of Service (including, but not
                limited to, its validity or enforceability). This Section shall apply to any claims asserted by you
                against any of our present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies and to any claims
                asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to this
                Terms of Service or the Extension.</p>
