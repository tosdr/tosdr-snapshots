<h3>11. Arbitration Agreement And Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection Clause.</h3>
<p>
You agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action
(including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy,
dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Cleanersmile shall exclusively be
settled through binding and confidential arbitration. Any such arbitration shall take place in the state
and county where you reside subject to the laws of the state of Florida.
</p>
<p>
Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state or provincial/territorial
arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial
experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from a nationally recognized arbitration services
such as JAMS pursuant to such organization's standard rules and procedures. The In the case of
arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus agreeing to GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to
assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be
determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the
arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions
are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
</p>
<p>
In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and Cleanersmile must abide by the following
rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR Cleanersmile MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY,
AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF
A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event that you are
able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
litigation, Cleanersmile will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as
compared to the cost of litigation; (4) Cleanersmile also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive
discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall
honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and
neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be
required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award
any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side
pays its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the
prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs
awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
</p>
<p>
In the event that a party fails to proceed with Arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the Arbitrator's
award, or fails to comply with the Arbitrator's award, the other party shall be entitled to costs of
suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
