By doing so, it will allow for smoother customs clearance for express shipments, ensuring the rights and interest of customers as well as maintaining a legal environment for businesses:\n● The scope is limited to individuals (excluding those who are non-Taiwanese, and corporate legal persons);\n● After verification, low-priced items (under NT$50,000 after tax) can be verified using a phone number, simplifying customs clearance for entrusted express agents.\nIn addition, the information on the import shipment’s bill of lading (waybill) must comply with the following specifications; otherwise, shipments will not be imported:\n  ● The shipment is from mainland China (Hong Kong and Macao included); Chinese name should be used for declaration;\n  ● The declaring consignee's phone number must be a valid Taiwan telephone number. For example: 02-8765-4321 or 0912-345-678;\n  ● The declaring consignee's name must match the ID card.\nFor more details regarding registration instructions, please see the Customs Website\n\u003ca
