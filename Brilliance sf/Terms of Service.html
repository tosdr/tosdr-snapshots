    <h3>Herbal Safety Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
      Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or
      consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a
      medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have
      shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is
      better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health
      conditions. The following are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list does not
      help with administering information on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine.
      This needs to be discussed with your physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a supplement? This is a good idea, especially
      for certain population groups. Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are
      pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease,
      be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral
      supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist
      before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or
      in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients
      that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain
      health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.
    </p>
    <h3>Reversals and Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>
      We consider Chargebacks and reversals as potential cases of fraudulent use of our services and/or theft of
      services, and will be treated as such. We reserve the right to file a complaint with the appropriate local and
      federal authorities to investigate. Be advised that all activity and IP address information is being monitored and
      that this information may be used in a civil and/or criminal case(s) against a client if there is fraudulent use
      and or theft of services.
