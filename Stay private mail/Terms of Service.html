                                        We prefer to address any concerns without resorting to the law courts. Before filing a claim against StayPrivate, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at disputes@stayprivate.com. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 28 days of submission, you or StayPrivate may bring a formal proceeding.

                                        StayPrivate believes that individuals have the right to know who can access their data and what terms. We also believe that this should apply to governments and companies alike.

                                        StayPrivate will only release information to governments or other authorities on the presentation of a valid search warrant issued under due legal process. Such a warrant should show probable cause in order to justify the disclosure of the stored contents and communication of any account.

                                        It is our policy to notify users and provide them with a copy of any civil or government legal process regarding their account (including formal requests for private information), unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so. If that is the case, we will notify users and provide them with a copy of the legal process when the prohibition expires.

                                        If a request for information is valid, we will preserve the necessary information before informing the user. In most cases, upon notification to the user, that user will be provided with either 7 days or the amount of time before the information is due, whichever is later, during which time the user may legally challenge the request. If, prior to the deadline, we receive notice that the user intends to challenge a request, no information will be delivered until that process concludes. We also review information requests and may lodge our own challenge to the scope or validity of legal process received, on behalf of a user, whether or not the user pursues their own legal challenge.

                                        StayPrivate is not designed to enable surveillance of users. In order to deliver StayPrivate, we may use third parties. If such a third party has access to data about our customers this would normally be anonymised. Nevertheless we expect all third parties to handle all data as StayPrivate would, meaning that they should not share the information with any other company or individual, use it any way other than to deliver the necessary service, nor assist governments in widespread surveillance of users.
                                    </p>

                                        StayPrivate is a UK-based company and adheres to UK privacy laws and standards. If it were to receive a National Security Letter (NSL) or its equivalent originating from the US government, and was advised that this letter was legally applicable in the UK, it would notify the US government that it would like the court to review the non-disclosure provision of the NSL pursuant to USA Freedom. The US government would have 30 days to let the court know why the non-disclosure should remain in effect. If we receive notice that the non-disclosure no longer applies, we will notify the affected customer.
