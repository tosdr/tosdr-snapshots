In the case of failure to provide any of the requested materials, to protect the user’s information and data security, we are entitled to denying such request.<br/>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable laws in your country of residence provide otherwise, the corresponding laws shall govern.</p>

<p>6. Securing Your Data<br/>
Pertaining to your use of our services, we have endeavored to take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to or improper use of your personal data, such as organizational controls, technical protection, and other protection measures.<br/>
