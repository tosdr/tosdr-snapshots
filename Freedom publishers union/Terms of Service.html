		not for surveillance purposes.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; font-family:VT323;">Network security technology is implemented and authorized for use by Cellnic Israel, but not limited to LinkNet

		bound and constrained to its design, to deliberately deny legitimate access to authorized users, to access, view, copy, alter, damage, destroy or delete data 
		and other forms of digital information, or otherwise to interfere with the system or its operation, is strictly prohibited and will be treated as suspicious, 
		without doubt, and prompt further investigation by Cellnic Israel, with the possibility of legal referral to external legal entities.</p>
