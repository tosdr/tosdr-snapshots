<p><strong>1. What Information Is Collected</strong></p>
<p class="buffer-left">The following are the types of information we may collect:</p>
<p class="pearl p-lg buffer-xs"><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p class="pearl p-lg">The Great Courses may collect personal information, which shall include but is not limited to, name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, home or business mailing address, and details regarding your mode of payment, <em>e.g.</em>, credit/debit card or account information, when you access certain areas of the Website that require registration or payment for products and services, or if you require more information about those services. <br><br><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> <br>At other times, The Great Courses may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information. &nbsp;For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you. <br>
<br>While we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic. <br>
<br>Further, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites. <br>
<br><strong>Electronic Communications</strong> <br>When you open emails from us or engage in SMS or MMS communications, we may log and store such information. We may also keep records of various communications regarding the types of products and services that you indicate are of interest to you via your response to email and text messaging.

<p class="pearl p-lg"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Great Courses uses the services of independent companies to provide certain services to you, including, without limitation, Website hosting services, course content distribution services, credit and debit card processing, mobile application providers, order fulfillment, contest and sweepstakes processing, and Internet connectivity services (“Internet Service Providers”) in connection with The Great Courses.&nbsp; We may share your non-personal and personal information with these third parties as necessary to provide these services to you. <br>
<br>We use your personal information to send you order confirmations. In such cases, you should receive via e-mail an order confirmation after placing your order. &nbsp;You may also receive confirmation e-mails from your designated payment processor.&nbsp; Occasionally, you will receive articles of interest on the subjects covered by our courses. From time-to-time you may receive e-mail surveys to vote for The Great Courses you want us to make, to rate the quality of The Great Courses Service or individual course titles, and to tell us what improvements to make to The Great Courses and our services. We may also use your personal information to notify you of special offers. You may receive e-mails notifying you when individual courses featured in our print catalogs and newsletters go on sale. These e-mails also make ordering extremely simple—if you see courses that interest you, simply click on the links in the e-mail to find out more. <br>
<br>We may also use your IP address to help protect us and our Internet Service Providers from fraud. Additional uses of your non-personal and personal information will allow us to tailor products and services specific to your needs, to help organize and manage your customer relationship and our business, to conduct business, to provide you with customer and member support, to perform functions that are described to you at the time of collection, and to enforce our Website’s Terms of Use. <br><br>We may also use non-personal aggregate information to improve our Website. For example, our Internet Service Providers may report to us that there were a particular number of visitors to a certain area of our Website, or that a certain number of men or a certain number of women completed our registration form in particular areas of our Website. Such information may also be used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising models. <br>
<br><strong>4. Shared Information</strong><br>We may share your personal information with the Internet Service Providers as appropriate.&nbsp; We may also share personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties that offer products and services that are complementary to our product lines.

<br>We use third-party ad serving, analytics, and audience and traffic measurement services.&nbsp; &nbsp;We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website or the use of our Services. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in. &nbsp;Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity.

Cookies allow third-party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Other companies' uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic. <br>
<br>Further, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites.
