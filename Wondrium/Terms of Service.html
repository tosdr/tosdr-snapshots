<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'><strong>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  The parties further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'><strong>b. &nbsp;Informal Disputes Resolution</strong>. Both the Company and the Subscriber shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You and we agree to personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference in a good faith effort to resolve informally any dispute prior to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration (&ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&rdquo;). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference, as will at least one of our corporate representatives. The party initiating a dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party sends a Notice, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases; unless all parties agree, multiple individuals initiating a dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference. If we have a dispute with you, we will send Notice to your billing address and/or email address you have provided to us. If you have a dispute with us, you will send Notice to us in writing at the following email and physical address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@teachco.com">legal@teachco.com</a>, or 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA &nbsp;20151, Attn: &nbsp;Legal Department using the subject line &ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference.&rdquo; Your Notice must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, email address, and your residential address. The Notice also must describe the dispute, explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. A Notice will not be valid, will not commence the time period for the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a mandatory condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant Notice, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it participated in an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference after sending Notice as required by this paragraph. If either party violates this Initial Dispute Resolution paragraph, a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to enjoin the prosecution of the arbitration or court proceeding, and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration provider shall neither accept nor administer any such arbitration nor assess fees in connection with such arbitration. The statute of limitations and all filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this paragraph.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'><strong>c. Class Action Waiver.</strong> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'>i.&nbsp; Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims or enforcement actions.  Notwithstanding the parties&rsquo; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction to the extent such claims do not seek equitable relief.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;'>ii. Intellectual Property, Trade Secrets, and Moral Rights. Either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:0.5in;">
    <li><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";font-size:16px;'>Mass Arbitration Defined. If 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a &ldquo;Mass Arbitration.&rdquo; If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall be administered by NAM, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the &ldquo;NAM Rules&rdquo;), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The NAM Rules are available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with NAM, you and we agree to contact NAM jointly to advise that the parties intend to use NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on NAM&rsquo;s claim form(s) and as directed by NAM. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from NAM compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";font-size:16px;'>Appointment of Procedural Arbitrator.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"; font-size:16px;'>You and we agree to cooperate in good faith to implement the Mass Arbitration process to minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Those steps include, but are not limited to (1) the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator to implement agreements by the parties to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the Mass Arbitration and to rule on proposals by the parties for the efficient and cost-effective management of the Mass Arbitration to the extent the parties cannot agree; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar for the arbitration proceedings.&nbsp;</span></li>

<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) &nbsp; Identification of the material or content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or have access disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, including address, telephone number and email address where the complaining party may be contacted;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(v) The following statement: &ldquo;I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law&rdquo;; and</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(vi) The following statement: &ldquo;The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.&rdquo;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >Upon receipt of the written notification containing the information as outlined in (i) through (vi) above:</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. We will remove or disable access to the content that is alleged to be infringing;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. We will forward the written notification to the alleged infringer; and</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. We will take reasonable steps to promptly notify the alleged infringer that we have removed or disabled access to the content.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >c. &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>DMCA Infringement Counter Notification</u></p>
<p >Pursuant to the DMCA, after the alleged infringer receives a notice of infringement from Company, the alleged infringer will have the opportunity to respond to Company with a counter notification (&ldquo;Counter Notification&rdquo;). To be effective, a Counter Notification must be a written communication provided to Company&rsquo;s designated copyright agent, and must include the following:</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) A physical or electronic signature of the person providing the Counter Notification;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) The following statement: &ldquo;I swear under penalty of perjury that it is my good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;&rdquo; and</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) The subscriber&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which the subscriber&rsquo;s address is located, or if the subscriber&rsquo;s address is outside of the United States, or any judicial district in which Company may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >Upon the copyright agent&rsquo;s receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in (i) through (iv) above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled and we will comply with this requirement as required by law, provided that the designated agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our network.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p ><strong>22. &nbsp;Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration Agreement&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p ><strong>Please Read the Following Provisions in this Section 22 Carefully &ndash; It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >a. &nbsp;Applicability. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including its formation, performance and breach) and the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  Subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 22, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.  The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Use shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p ><strong>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  The parties further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p ><strong>b. &nbsp;Informal Disputes Resolution</strong>. Both the Company and the Subscriber shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You and we agree to personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference in a good faith effort to resolve informally any dispute prior to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration (&ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&rdquo;). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference, as will at least one of our corporate representatives. The party initiating a dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party sends a Notice, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases; unless all parties agree, multiple individuals initiating a dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference. If we have a dispute with you, we will send Notice to your billing address and/or email address you have provided to us. If you have a dispute with us, you will send Notice to us in writing at the following email and physical address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@teachco.com">legal@teachco.com</a>, or 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA &nbsp; 20151, Attn: &nbsp;Legal Department using the subject line &ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference.&rdquo; Your Notice must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, email address, and your residential address. The Notice also must describe the dispute, explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. A Notice will not be valid, will not commence the time period for the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a mandatory condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant Notice, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it participated in an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference after sending Notice as required by this paragraph. If either party violates this Initial Dispute Resolution paragraph, a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to enjoin the prosecution of the arbitration or court proceeding, and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration provider shall neither accept nor administer any such arbitration nor assess fees in connection with such arbitration. The statute of limitations and all filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this paragraph.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p ><strong>c. Class Action Waiver.</strong> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p ><strong>d. &nbsp;Exceptions.</strong></p>
<p >i.&nbsp; Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims or enforcement actions.  Notwithstanding the parties&rsquo; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction to the extent such claims do not seek equitable relief.&nbsp;</p>
<p >ii. Intellectual Property, Trade Secrets, and Moral Rights. Either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >iii. Mass Arbitration.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><span >Mass Arbitration Defined. If 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a &ldquo;Mass Arbitration.&rdquo; If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall be administered by NAM, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the &ldquo;NAM Rules&rdquo;), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The NAM Rules are available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with NAM, you and we agree to contact NAM jointly to advise that the parties intend to use NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on NAM&rsquo;s claim form(s) and as directed by NAM. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from NAM compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span >Appointment of Procedural Arbitrator.&nbsp;</span><span>You and we agree to cooperate in good faith to implement the Mass Arbitration process to minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Those steps include, but are not limited to (1) the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator to implement agreements by the parties to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the Mass Arbitration and to rule on proposals by the parties for the efficient and cost-effective management of the Mass Arbitration to the extent the parties cannot agree; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar for the arbitration proceedings.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
