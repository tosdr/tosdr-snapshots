<p>The Organization for Transformative Works (“OTW”) is the nonprofit behind Fanlore. The OTW is committed to defending fanworks — including meta, analysis and curatorial content — against legal challenges. Our position on transformative fanworks is detailed in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.transformativeworks.org/faq/">OTW FAQ</a>.
</p><p>These Terms of Service constitute an agreement between you and the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) and govern your use of the Fanlore service (hereinafter “Service”, “Fanlore” or “Site”). It takes the place of all prior agreements between you and the OTW concerning your use of the Service. It does not govern your use of other OTW sites and/or projects, including the OTW site itself, Archive of Our Own, or Transformative Works and Cultures, or donations to or membership in the OTW, or OTW elections, all of which are covered under separate agreements hosted on each of the OTW Sites. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="You_Agree_to_the_Terms_of_Service">You Agree to the Terms of Service</span></h3>
<p>Fanlore hosts and shares content created by fans, for fans. Our Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms of Service and is contained in <a href="#privacy">Section 4 of these Terms of Service</a>. By editing or creating a page, adding to a talk page, posting an image or image identifier, posting any item of information including personally identifying information like an e-mail address, user name, link, embedded image, audio file or video, or submitting any other form of content (collectively, "Content") to the Site, or by creating a user account and/or by viewing any Content on the Site, you affirm, confirm and state that you comply with and assent to the ToS, including the Fanlore Age Policy and Fanlore Privacy Policy.
</p><p>These Terms of Service are subject to amendments of the update process by the OTW Board, which is the only means by which the Terms of Service may be altered. The Terms of Service cannot be changed by, e.g., e-mails or oral communications with you. If these Terms of Service and/or its Privacy Policy change at any point in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site. Such changes will be used only for information provided by those who have visited, used, or accessed the Service after the effective date of such policy changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at the Site periodically to review the policies. If you feel that the Service is not following these Terms of Service, please <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/?who=Fanlore">contact the Fanlore Committee</a>.
</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that the OTW may preserve Content and may disclose Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process (such as a valid subpoena); enforce the ToS; respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the OTW services' users and the public.
</p><p>You agree not to use the Site to do the following. Fanlore reserves the right to remove Content and disable accounts of users who do the following:
</p>
<ol><li>impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a Fanlore or OTW representative or volunteer, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
<li>make available any Content that a court has ruled constitutes patent, trademark, trade secret or copyright infringement (please be aware of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq">OTW's position on fanwork legality</a>);</li>
<li>make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer or hardware or telecommunications equipment;</li>
<li>make available material that contains or links to child pornography (images of real children); warez, cracks, hacks or other executable files and their associated utilities; trade secrets, restricted technologies, or classified information.</li>

<li>violate the Site Age Policy described below; or</li>
<li>use OTW services to break any law that applies to you, including any rules or regulations having the force of law. Just by way of example, do not use the services to disseminate restricted technologies or violate laws governing the export of technical data.</li></ol>
<p>You acknowledge that the OTW provides Fanlore on an “as is” and “as available” basis. The OTW expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind. The OTW does not promise that our services will meet your requirements; that our services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or that the results you get from using the services will be accurate, reliable, or satisfactory to you. We will endeavor to provide the best possible service to users of the Service, but many things (e.g., possible outages, hackings, etc.) are not within our control and we cannot provide for all eventualities. In the event we learn of a breach of personally identifying information that users have submitted to the Service, we will notify affected users as soon as practicable. 
</p><p>Any material you view, obtain, or otherwise access through the Service is at your own risk. You will be solely responsible for any damage or loss of data that results from the any such activity. You expressly agree that the OTW shall not be liable to you for any damages of any kind (even if the OTW has been advised of the possibility of such damages) resulting from the Service, including but not limited to your use of or inability to use the Service; unauthorized access to or changes in Content or information you submit; and the acts and statements of third parties who use the Service.
</p><p>You agree that the OTW shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of or limitation on your access to Fanlore. The OTW may change, end, or put on hiatus the Service, or parts of its Services, at any time.
</p><p>You agree that the OTW shall not be liable to you for any claim arising out of Content you make available, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your use of the ToS, or your violation of any rights of another.
</p><p>In other words, the OTW is not liable to you for allowing you to post Content, use the Service, or otherwise interact with Fanlore. The OTW does not assume whatever legal risks you face by posting, viewing, or doing other things with Content.

<p>This Fanlore ToS, the relationship between you and the OTW, and all disputes arising out of or related to it, shall be governed by the laws of the United States and specifically the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and the OTW agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County (Manhattan), New York, and to waive any objection to the laying of venue there.
</p><p>The OTW's failure to enforce any part of the ToS will not waive the OTW's ability to enforce it, and any waiver with regard to a specific instance shall not constitute a waiver of any other breaches of the ToS, even with regard to the same user.
</p><p>If any provision of the ToS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you agree that the court should give effect to the party's intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of the ToS remain in full force and effect.
</p><p>You agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or the ToS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Site_Age_Policy">Site Age Policy</span></h3>
<p>This Age Policy covers the Site's treatment of (a) users who are residents or citizens of the European Union and of the age where consent of a parent or legal guardian is required for the processing of personal data of children including e-mail addresses and IP addresses, as well as certain uses of cookies; and (b) users who are under the age of thirteen (13) and residents or citizens of any other country.
</p>
<ol><li>We as an organization have opted to protect teen users’ privacy. As a result, we cannot receive or host Content from individuals that we know are under the age of sixteen and residents/citizens of the European Union, unless they are residents/citizens of the EU countries that allow the collection of Special Categories of Personal Data from those at a younger age and are old enough to consent to the collection of Special Categories of Personal Data in their own country. Therefore, any individual who is between the ages of 13 and 16 and a resident or citizen of a country, including a European Economic Area country, that states an age that is older than theirs is required to consent to the processing of personal data without our obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian under the GDPR (“Age-Barred Individual”) may not maintain accounts or submit Content. By creating an account or submitting Content, you thereby confirm that if you are between the ages of 13 and 16, you are of an age old enough to consent to the processing of personal data in your country without our obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.betterinternetforkids.eu/web/portal/practice/awareness/detail?articleId=3017751">A list of countries that apply the GDPR can be found here.</a> Each user is responsible for knowing the laws of their own country.</li>
<li>In compliance with United States regulations regarding online privacy for children, the Site does not knowingly solicit or collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13). Children under the age of thirteen (13) are therefore not permitted to have an account or submit Content of any type to the Site. By creating an account or submitting Content to the Site, you thereby confirm that you are thirteen (13) years old or older.</li></ol>
<p>Asking a parent or legal guardian to submit Content does not constitute submitting Content under this policy. If you are under the age of thirteen (13) and not an Age-Barred Individual, your parent or legal guardian may submit content at your request through their account.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Data_and_Content_Processing">Data and Content Processing</span></h3>
<p>Fanlore and the OTW exist to host content about fandoms and canon. In order to host or share Content, we have to process certain data and information including personally identifying information that we collect from users, and that each user inputs. In order to operate the site, host OTW and user Content, and prevent technical issues and breaches, we need to process (e.g. collect, store, retrieve, disseminate, make available, and delete) certain data and information including personally identifying information, also known as “Personal Data”. Personal Data includes your user name, your e-mail address, your IP information and any personally identifying information you enter on the Site, including information that you put into your User Page (defined below), into the body of a page or other Content itself. 
</p><p>Running the Site requires us to make copies and backup copies of information, including Personal Data, on servers that may be located anywhere around the world.
</p><p>By using the site, you consent to our collection, processing, retention and display of your Content as set forth and explained in these Terms of Use so we can operate, manage, display and share the creativity on Fanlore; if we believe that using, retaining and/or sharing that information is necessary to preserve the integrity of the Site and the Content that we host; for legitimate legal and/or accounting audit purposes; when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; or when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.

</p><p>g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
</p><p>h.

</p><p>i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
</p><p>2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
</p><p>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
</p><p>a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
</p><p>b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.

</p><p>c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
</p><p>d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

</p><p>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
</p><p>a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
</p><p>b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
</p><p>c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. 
</p><p>d. For the avoidance of doubt:
</p><p>i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
</p><p>ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
</p><p>iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
</p><p>e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
</p><p>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
</p><p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</p><p>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p><p>7. Termination
</p><p>a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
</p><p>b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
</p><p>8. Miscellaneous
</p><p>a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
</p><p>b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
</p><p>c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p><p>d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
</p><p>e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
</p><p>f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

<p>To participate in editing Fanlore, you must create a user account. Editing activity is publicly and permanently associated with user accounts as described below.  If you only read the Fanlore website, we do not collect any more information than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general. By using Fanlore, you consent to our collecting, processing, and retaining certain information, as described in detail below.  We may use the information we collect to maintain the integrity of the site and for statistical and technical purposes, such as site debugging.  The policy below describes in detail what information we collect, process, and retain, what we do with such information, and why we do it.
</p><p>The policy below also describes what information is publicly available on Fanlore. If you contribute to Fanlore, you are publishing every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, User Pages (as defined below) and talk pages. Some limited exceptions are described in this policy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="User_accounts">User accounts</span></h3>

<p>By using Fanlore, you consent to the following:
</p><p>Any information you post to Fanlore, including information you post in an article, User Page, or talk page, will be publicly available. You are not required to include any particular information in your User Page other than your user name.  Any information you do include in such places--including your User Page--about your religious views, political views or your sexual identity, or about any personally identifying information such as your e-mail address, location, or account user name for other sites will be accessible by the general public.  
</p><p>You should assume that any information you post on Fanlore will be retained forever. Fanlore is a wiki. Therefore, removing text from Fanlore does not permanently delete it or make it unavailable to the public. Under normal circumstances, anyone can look at a previous version of a Fanlore page and see what was there. For information to become unavailable to the public, it must be hidden from Site history by Site administrators.  Fanlore does not promise to hide or delete information from its servers except in special circumstances, such as in <a href="/wiki/Fanlore:Identity_Protection" title="Fanlore:Identity Protection">Identity Protection</a> cases.  If you wish to request that information be hidden or deleted permanently from Fanlore servers, you may <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/?who=Fanlore">contact the Fanlore Committee</a>.

<p>The OTW will not provide any third party with any of your personal information or any of the information we collect, except information you make public, or as otherwise provided under the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy above. We will not use your personally identifying information to market third party products and services to you via the Site. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifying information. 
</p><p>Except as provided under these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personally identifying information that you do not make public to any third party without your prior consent unless we (1) are legally compelled to do so, (2) have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on the OTW, or (3) are cooperating with law enforcement authorities. As to (3), we will cooperate with all investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities within the United States of America when legally required to do so. Cooperation with law enforcement authorities from other countries and cooperation when it is not legally required are at our sole discretion. Our discretion looks favorably on freedom and justice, and unfavorably on oppression and violence.
