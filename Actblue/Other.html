<p class="center-text"><a
href="/content/legal-terms-previous">Previous
version</a></p>
<h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>ActBlue provides technology and services for Democratic candidates,
progressive organizations, nonprofits, and donors.  These Terms of
Service ("Terms") govern your access to, interactions with, and use of
ActBlue's platform, including our website, services, features, and other
technology we offer (collectively, our "Services"), except where we have
expressly stated that separate terms apply.  By accessing or using our
Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are provided by, and you are contracting with, ActBlue LLC or
an <a href="https://support.actblue.com/donors/about-actblue/what-is-the-difference-between-actblue-actblue-civics-ab-charities-and-actblue-technical-services/">affiliate</a>
in the ActBlue organization, depending on the Services provided. As used in
these Terms of Service, “we”, “us”, “our”, and “ActBlue” means ActBlue LLC and
our affiliates.
</p>
<h3 id="privacy">2. Privacy</h3>
<p>By using ActBlue, you also agree that we can collect and use your
personal information in accordance with our <a
href="https://secure.actblue.com/legal-privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. This
includes your interactions and communications with ActBlue on other
websites, services, and platforms.  We encourage you to read it to
better understand how we collect and use personal information.</p>
<h3 id="our-services">3. Our Services</h3>
<ol type="1" class="letter-list">
<li><p>Scope of Services</p>
<p>ActBlue builds technology and infrastructure for Democratic
campaigns, progressive-aligned causes, and people trying to make an
impact in order to fuel long-term, people-powered change.  In
furtherance of this mission, we engage in a variety of activities that
are subject to these Terms, including developing, operating, providing,
improving upon, and protecting the ActBlue platform.</p>
<p>Our Services include providing fundraising tools for building a
campaign or movement, and solutions for donors to discover and
contribute to a candidate or cause.  Some of our Services and features
may require creating an account, such as ActBlue Express or fundraising
on the ActBlue platform, while other Services can be used without an
account.</p>
<p>
For donations to 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, the respective merchants of record for those transactions are ActBlue Charities Inc. and ActBlue Civics Inc.  We receive and process those donations and subsequently give them to the organization or cause indicated on the contribution form.
</p>
<p>We are not a professional fundraiser, fundraising consultant, or
fundraising counsel to the individuals and organizations that use
ActBlue. More information about our Services is available on our
website, including in our <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/">Support</a> page.</p></li>
<li><p>Service Modification</p>
<p>We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve
our Services.  As part of this continual evolution, we may add, remove,
change, or discontinue certain features or functionalities.  We cannot
guarantee the ongoing availability of any of our Services, except where
we have separately made such commitments to you.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="your-commitments">4. Your Commitments</h3>
<ol type="1" class="letter-list">
<li><p>Your Eligibility</p>
<p>You agree to the following commitments concerning your eligibility to
access and use our Services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age Requirements</strong>. You must be at least 18 years
old, or the age of majority in your state of residence, to use our
Services.  If we become aware that you are under this minimum age, we
will suspend your access to our Services and/or delete your
account. </li>
<li><strong>Correct Information.</strong> To promote the safety and
accountability of our platform and community, you shall truthfully
represent yourself when using our services.  You must provide us with
accurate, complete, and updated information for your account or when
making a contribution.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Authority.</strong> If you are using our Services
on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent that you have
authority to bind that organization or entity to these Terms.  All
references to “you” and “your” in these Terms will apply to both you and
that organization or entity.</li>
<li><strong>Restricted Users.</strong>  You cannot use our Services if
we have previously disabled your account or restricted your use due to
violation of these Terms or other terms and policies, unless we
specifically permit you to do so.]{.c2}</li>
<li><strong>Other Limitations.</strong> You cannot use our Services if
you are a person who is barred from doing so under the laws of the
United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. For example, we
cannot take part in transactions that involve any individual or entity
that (1) is the target of U.S. sanctions or anti-terrorism measures,
including parties that have been designated for economic sanctions or
trade restrictions on any restricted party list maintained by U.S.
authorities that administer applicable trade controls, including but not
limited to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the United
States Department of the Treasury; (2) is owned 50% or more,
individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, by any person
or entity designated on any relevant restricted party list or that is
otherwise acting on or behalf of or for the benefit of a designated
party; or (3) is located or ordinarily resident in, or otherwise
conducting activities in, a country or territory that is subject to
comprehensive sanctions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Your Use and Conduct</p>
<p>We expect you to help keep ActBlue’s platform and community secure,
safe, and respectful.  Your activity on our platform must comply with
these Terms—including policies referenced in these Terms, such as our <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/campaigns/faq/actblue-account-use-policy/">Account
Use Policy</a>—and any additional supplemental terms and policies that
apply to certain ActBlue services or features that you use.  If you
agree and comply with these Terms, ActBlue grants you a non-assignable,
non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the
Services in accordance with these Terms.  We reserve the right to
suspend access to our Services, delete accounts, or take other
reasonably necessary steps to address a violation of these Terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respecting Laws.</strong>  Your use of our Services must
comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international
laws, rules, and regulations.  For example, while some of our Services
are designed to support your legal compliance, you are ultimately
responsible for ensuring that your political fundraising activities and
contributions comply with applicable campaign finance laws, including
source prohibitions and contribution limits.  Additionally, you may not
use ActBlue’s Services to engage in any activities that would violate
applicable international trade controls or anti-terrorism laws,
including, but not limited to, economic sanctions laws and regulations
administered by OFAC.</li>
<li><strong>Respecting Others.</strong>  You may not use our Services to
do anything that infringes or violates someone else’s rights, including
their privacy and intellectual property rights.  You cannot use our
Services to abuse or harm others, including threatening or encouraging
such abuse or harm.  For example, you cannot use ActBlue services to
mislead, defraud, illegally impersonate, defame, bully, harass, or stalk
others.</li>
<li><strong>Respecting ActBlue.</strong> You cannot abuse, harm,
interfere with, or disrupt our Services, including ActBlue’s technology
and infrastructure. For example, you cannot access or use our Services
in unpermitted ways, introduce malware or spam, or attempt to circumvent
our security, integrity, and other protective measures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Your Content</p>
<p>Some of our Services, such as contribution forms, allow you to
upload, share, provide, or otherwise make available certain content that
you own or have rights to use, including text, photos, videos, music or
other audio, or branding including trademarks and logos (collectively,
“Content”).  By providing any Content to the Services, you agree that
(i) you have sufficient rights in such Content to provide ActBlue the
license as set forth herein and (ii) the Content and/or the provision of
such Content does not violate any third party’s privacy or intellectual
property rights.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountability.</strong>  Content is the responsibility of
the person or entity that provides or makes it available on or through
the Services, and ActBlue is under no obligation to host or provide
Content.  If you see any Content that you believe does not comply with
these Terms or applicable laws, you can <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/campaigns/faq/how-can-i-report-unwanted-communications-from-campaigns-or-organizations-or-a-potential-violation-of-actblues-terms-and-policies/">report
it</a> to us.</li>
<li><strong>License.</strong> By providing us Content, you grant us a
non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide
license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or
display, translate, and create derivative works of such Content. This
license will end when Content is deleted from our systems.  However, our
license will continue on a case-specific basis if deletion of the
Content would impair our ability to (i) detect, investigate, or respond
to illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies; (ii)
protect the safety, integrity, and security of our platform, our
employees, and our users; or (iii) respond to legal process or comply
with legal obligations such as record keeping or preservation of
evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feedback</p>
<p>If you voluntarily send us feedback, suggestions or recommendations
about the Services (“Feedback”), we may freely use Feedback without duty
or obligation to you.  We are not obligated to use Feedback, but if we
do, then it becomes part of the Services and our property.  All Feedback
will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not
be liable for any use or disclosure of any Feedback, nor will the
submitter be entitled to any compensation for our use of their Feedback.
 By sending us any Feedback, you represent and warrant (a) that you have
the right to disclose the Feedback, (b) that the Feedback does not
violate the rights of any other person or entity, and (c) that your
Feedback does not contain the confidential or proprietary information of
any third party or parties.  This Feedback section shall survive any
termination of your account, these Terms, or your use of ActBlue’s
Services.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Transactions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payments.</strong>  When you make a contribution, we may ask
you to provide certain information to complete your contribution,
including your contact and payment information, and you expressly
authorize us to charge you for such contribution and any recurring
contributions you authorized.  You can also <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/donors/contributions/how-do-i-update-my-credit-card-and-personal-information-in-my-account/">update</a>
 your saved payment information using our Services.  We and our service
providers typically address payment issues such as fraud, chargebacks,
and resolution of payment disputes, but in cases involving third party
services or platforms, we may be unable to address your issue or may
direct you to those parties.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Contributions.</strong> Some of our features
provide the ability for you to make recurring contributions, such as on
a monthly basis. <strong>If you make a recurring contribution, you
authorize ActBlue to automatically initiate recurring payments as set
forth in these Terms.</strong>  Your recurring contribution will
automatically continue at the selected interval, and we will charge at
the designated cadence (e.g., monthly) unless prior to the next
contribution: (a) you cancel, pause, or otherwise modify your recurring
contribution;  (b) the recipient stops fundraising on our platform; or
(c) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted
herein.  You may <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/donors/contributions/how-do-i-change-or-cancel-my-recurring-contribution/">cancel</a> recurring
contributions at any time, but please note that such cancellation will
be effective only for future charges associated with your recurring
contributions.  If you have questions about recurring contributions
or believe you made a recurring contribution in error, please contact
our <a href="https://support.actblue.com/">Support</a> team.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds.</strong> ActBlue will make best efforts to
accommodate requests for refunds and will honor each request on a
case-by-case basis and at our sole discretion or where required by law.
 All refund requests are subject to the availability of the
contributions funds, and ActBlue will only refund a contribution if we
still have the funds or can recover the funds from the recipient.  Any
refund issued by ActBlue will be credited back to the original payment
method used to make the contribution.  In cases where ActBlue is unable
to accommodate a refund request, we may refer you to the recipient of
your contribution so that you may request a refund directly from them.
 You can learn more <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/donors/contributions/can-i-get-a-refund-for-a-donation-i-made-through-actblue/)">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other Expectations</p>
<p>Your reasonable efforts and sound judgment are necessary to help
protect yourself, others, and the integrity of our platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Security.</strong>  If you have an account with us,
you are responsible for keeping it secure, and for anything that occurs
if someone else is signed in to your account.  ActBlue is not liable for
any loss or damage resulting from your failure to maintain the security
of your account or your password, and we expect you to <a
href="https://actblue.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact us</a>
immediately if you believe your account is compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Misuse of Services.</strong>  You are not permitted to
access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display,
sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of our Services,
including Content hosted or made available by ActBlue, except as
permitted by these Terms or with our prior written permission and, if
applicable, the respective rights holder.  You may not cause or
encourage any inaccurate measurements of user engagement with our
Services, or access our Services using automated means—such as bots or
scrapers—except in the case of indexing for public search engines or
with our written permission.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited Commercial Activity.</strong> You may not use our
Services to (i) distribute unsolicited commercial content, which is any
media or material that is distributed with the intention of promoting,
advertising, or generating revenue for a particular product, service, or
for-profit business; [or (ii) use our Services to sell or market
consumer products, advertising, sponsorships, or promotions to or on
behalf of yourself or others.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting.</strong>  We appreciate your help in <a
href="https://support.actblue.com/campaigns/faq/how-can-i-report-unwanted-communications-from-campaigns-or-organizations-or-a-potential-violation-of-actblues-terms-and-policies/">reporting</a> suspicious

<h3 id="general-provisions">7. General Provisions</h3>
<ol type="1" class="letter-list">
<li><p>Changes to these Terms</p>
<p>ActBlue may update these Terms from time to time as we improve our
platform and develop new services and features.  Unless otherwise
required by law, we will let you know of any important changes by
revising the date at the top of these Terms.  In some cases, we may add
an additional early notice on our website or send you an email if you
provided us with that information.  Your continued use of the Services
after changes indicates your acceptance of the new Terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>These Terms, including any additional terms and policies referenced
within, comprise the entire agreement between you and ActBlue and
supersede any prior agreements.  If we do not enforce a provision in
these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver of our rights to enforce
these Terms.  We reserve the right to transfer our rights under these
Terms and provide the Services using another entity.  You may not
transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our
consent.  We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Termination</p>
<p>ActBlue reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend,
discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, some or all of
the Services (or any part thereof), with or without notice and without
liability to you or any third party.</p>
<p>ActBlue may terminate or suspend your right to access some or all of
the Services, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any of
the terms or conditions of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including
using the Services in violation of any applicable law such as trade
controls or anti-terrorism laws.  Should ActBlue suspect that an
individual or entity is using its platform in violation of said laws, we
reserve the right to investigate the suspected unlawful conduct.
 ActBlue will immediately suspend or terminate an individual or entity
determined to have violated applicable law.</p>
<p>In the event of termination of these Terms, all sections which by
their nature should survive termination shall survive.</p></li>
