                            <p>This Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy (<b>“Cookie Policy”</b>) describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies that are used on the website from which you are accessing this Cookie Policy (the <b>“Website”</b>). We may change this Cookies Policy at any time. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through this Website.</p>

                <p class="t-b"> What are cookies and similar technologies?</p>
                            <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.
<br><br>
Cookies store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our Website. 
<br><br>
Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are a similar technology which typically uses transparent graphic images placed on a site to gather information about a user. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites. We make use of cookies and similar technologies when you visit our Website, and refer to the technologies together as “cookies” throughout this policy.</p>
