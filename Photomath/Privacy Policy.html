<h2 id="7-added-features-from-third-parties">7. Added features from third parties</h2>
<p>We may decide to expand our Services from time to time with additional third-party content to provide you with added features and better user experience. The use of such third-party content will never be a prerequisite for using the Services. Should you choose to use such third-party content, you may have to provide some Personal Information to such third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of such added features are micro-tutoring services offered to you within the Application. It would be impossible to provide you such services without sharing your user-generated images with the provider of micro tutoring services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever we offer any added features in our Application, we will make sure that that third-party content provider adheres to our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, and the principles contained therein, and we will take special care that your Personal Information is deleted as soon as possible after you finish using such added features.</p>

We only process your Personal information for direct marketing purposes if you have expressly allowed such processing with the positive action; in other words, if you have opted-in for such processing. In any case, we only collect user personal information if we have legitimate interest to do so.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right to rectification. The right to have incomplete, incorrect, outdated, or unnecessary personal data corrected, or updated.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right to restrict processing/Right not to be profiled. Profiling consists of solely automated processing of personal data which evaluate some personal aspects relating to you, for instance, the country from which you are using our Services so we can show you more relevant ads. You will not be subject to such automated processing and decision making unless you have either given us your consent or if there is a legal basis/justified interest. Profiling is usually used for the purpose of incorporating relevant marketing. Our use of such processing shall not have any negative legal repercussion for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to access. You have the right to request access to Personal data we hold about you, or to request a copy of such data. If you would like to know what personal data we hold about you, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@photomath.com">privacy@photomath.com</a>.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right to be informed. We will inform you about processing of your Personal data, purposes of processing, transfer of your data, retention policy, as well as information about us and contact details should you ever choose to contact us. In a way, we build this Privacy Policy to comply with your right to be informed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing information to the Service that forms the basis of communications with you, such as contact information, you agree to receive electronic communications from us. However, you have the right to opt out of receiving electronic direct marketing communications from us: All electronic direct marketing communications that you may receive from us, such as e-mail messages and SMS-messages, give you an option of not receiving such communications from us in the future. If you have any additional questions about electronic direct marketing received from us, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@photomath.com">privacy@photomath.com</a>.</p>
<p>For your protection and the protection of all our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can comply with some of your requests.</p>
<p>No user shall ever be discriminated against for exercising any of its privacy rights. However, please note that some information is sometimes necessary to provide the Services, or offer promotions, discounts, or other deals. You can always request information about how your request may affect your participation in such cases. For instance, we cannot provide customer support without you providing us with your contact information.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you also have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. However, we expressly state that we do not sell and have not sold any of your Personal Information in the past.&nbsp;Moreover, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this notice, please submit your request&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@photomath.com">here</a>. Please allow 30 days for a response.

<p><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts on our or third party websites more relevant to you and your interests, as well as to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. We may utilize cookies and technologies from our marketing partners (Google), and/or social media platforms (Facebook). These technologies help us measure the efficacy of our marketing campaigns and to understand how visitors navigate to the Websites from our ads on other websites. They help us and our marketing partners (Google LLC and/or Facebook Inc.) determine how many times people who click on our ads end up using our services or performing a particular action, which information will be transmitted to our aforementioned marketing partners. These technologies are used to compile statistics about visitors who interact with the Websites and our other online content, to estimate the effectiveness of our ads, and to provide more pertinent information to our visitors. This also includes using previously collected information about your interests to select ads and whether you took any action related to the advertisement, including for example clicking an ad. For this purposes we use:</p>
<p><b>(i) Retargeting</b></p>
<p>This website uses&nbsp;retargeting&nbsp;technology for online advertising. This makes it possible to specifically address the Internet browsers with advertising that have already shown interest in our products and services. It is known from studies that the display of interest-based advertising is more interesting for the Internet user than advertising that has no such relevance. With retargeting, the display of the advertising media is done on the basis of a cookie-based analysis of the previous visit behavior. This Website uses the Google Analytics functions for marketing tools such as remarketing lists for search ads and remarketing for the Google display network. If you do not wish interest-based advertising from Google to be displayed, you can deactivate this function here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=hr">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=hr&nbsp;</a>.

<p><b>(ii) Facebook-Pixel</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;We use “Facebook Pixel” of the social network Facebook Inc. (Facebook). The Facebook pixel can track the behavior of users after clicking on a Facebook ad. With the aid of the Facebook pixel, we can understand how our marketing measures are being adopted on Facebook and, if necessary, are taking optimization measures.

If you want to disable cookie storage placed by Facebook, you need to change your browser settings.

<h2 id="11-our-security-measures">11. Our Security Measures</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal information from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, by retaining it in a firewalled and secured database with strictly limited and controlled access rights, using encryption. Despite these efforts to store personal data collected in and through the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the security of personal data during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of personal data, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-parties such as so-called hackers from illegally obtaining access to personal data. We do not warrant or represent that personal data about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.</p>
<h2 id="12-california-residents">12. California residents</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, then the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to you and regulates how we should act in respect to the collection, possession, and sale of your Personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see that we have already implemented such practices in the “Your Rights” section, but we will still give you a short overview of the most important rights under the CCPA</p>
<h3 id="a-your-rights">a) Your rights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The&nbsp;right to request disclosure of the personal information we have collected in the past 12 months and how it was used and shared;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to delete personal information we have collected (and receive a reply within 45 days, or 90 days pursuant to such notification)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. Please note that we do not sell your Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to equal service and non-discrimination for exercising your CCPA rights</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on how CCPA applies to you, please visit the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Attorney-General’s website&nbsp;</a>.</p>
<h3 id="b-do-not-sell-my-personal-information">b) Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h3>
<p>The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can opt out of the ”sale” of their Personal Information.</p>
<p>We do not sell your Personal information, nor do we put such information on the open market.</p>
<p>However, we respect and understand that you may still want to ensure your personal information is not sold. If you want to give a statement on the sale of your Personal information, please follow the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on our main page.</p>
<p>If you opt out through that link, you will no longer receive personalized ads.</p>
<h3 id="c-do-not-track-dnt">c) Do not track (DNT)</h3>
<p>“Do Not Track”&nbsp;DNT is a web browser preference or a setting that users can manually set on the browser and opt-out from online tracking of a user.</p>
<p>We do not currently respond to user’s „Do Not Track“ browser signals or other browser or device based mechanisms as to date, no standard has been adopted. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working hard to develop such a standard and create an international consensus. We keep track of that progress and will notify you of any changes.</p>
<p>However, we do provide consumers with the ability to manage their cookie choices as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h3 id="d-metrics">d) Metrics</h3>
<p>Subject to certain conditions, the CCPA requires some service providers to disclose certain metrics by July 1 of every calendar year about requests received from California residents in the previous calendar year, for instance, to disclose the number of requests to delete personal information. We do not currently meet these requirements, but we are constantly monitoring any changes to be ready for the day we qualify for such an obligation.</p>
<h2 id="13-international-transfers-of-personal-data">13. International Transfers of Personal Data</h2>
<p>As we operate globally, some elements of the Service may be hosted on servers located in countries outside your own country. The laws applicable to the protection of personal data in such countries may be different from those applicable in your home country. In particular, if you are located within the European Union, please note that personal data collected by us is transferred outside the European Union / European Economic Area. By using our Services, you consent to personal data about you being transferred outside your own country and, where applicable, outside the European Union / European Economic Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever we transfer your Personal information, or otherwise store or process such information, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your Personal information. These steps may include obtaining your consent or implementing contractual clauses defining rules and obligations in respect to such transfer or processing.</p>
<h2 id="14-advertising">14. Advertising</h2>
<p>To support and enhance the Services, we work with a variety of third party advertising networks, marketing analytics service providers and website analysis firms such as Facebook and Google (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers collect and use personal data about your visits to and use of the Website and mobile Application, as well as other websites in order to serve you with advertisements and content tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests or better understand ad effectiveness. Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads from advertisers and ad networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or who follow the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising using their respective opt-out tools. The NAI’s opt-out tool can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">here</a>&nbsp;and the DAA’s opt out tool can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a>. You may also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, your mobile devices may offer settings that enable you to make choices about the collection, use, or transfer of mobile app information for online behavioral advertising (for example, Apple iOS’ Advertising ID and Google Android’s Advertising ID). Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.</p>
<h2 id="15-childrens-privacy">15. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We keep track of your age when you use our Services. This is because we will never knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years of age (or applicable age in your country).</p>
<p>If you are under 16 years of age, we will either request your consent or consent of your authorized holder of parental responsibility before we process your Personal information in any way.</p>
<p>We do not sell your information and we always ask for consent, so naturally, that applies especially to children under 16 years of age wherever they might be from.</p>
<p>If you learn that we have unknowingly collected personal data from a child, please contact us at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@photomath.com">privacy@photomath.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="16-data-retention">16. Data retention</h2>
<p>We only retain Personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. General rules concerning data retention require that Personal data be either deleted after some time or that such data be anonymized or retained in other aggregated form by which you cannot be personally identified. Our Privacy Policy uses the term “delete” for all such practices.</p>
<p>We only collect and therefore store anonymized data from your first use of Services. In the absence of any legal requirements regarding data retention we intend to keep it that way. For other cases, for example Tax law or Employment law, we shall comply with applicable law requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, we will delete any Personal data if you so request or if you withdraw your consent to processing. We will also delete data which we find is no longer up to date or is no longer necessary for the original purpose of processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>erasure of the unique identifiers which allow the allocation of a data set to a unique person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>erasure of single pieces of information that identify the data subject (whether alone or in combination with other pieces of information);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>separation of personal data from non-identifying information (e.g. an order number from the customer’s name and address); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aggregation of personal data in a way that no allocation to any individual is possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="17-changes-to-the-privacy-policy">17. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>From time to time we may change this Privacy Policy. You can tell when changes have been made to the Privacy Policy by referring to the “Last Updated” legend on top of this page. If we materially change the ways in which we use and disclose personal data, we will post a notice in the Service. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Service to stay informed about our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service following any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of any such changes made.</p>
