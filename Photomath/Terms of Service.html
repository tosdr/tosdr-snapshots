<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Our Services consist of the Photomath application that helps users to solve math problems (the “Application”), and the related website located at&nbsp;<a href="https://photomath.com/">photomath.com</a>&nbsp;(the “Site”), including all content provided through the Application and/or the Site. When we speak of “Photomath”, “we”, “us” and “our” we mean Photomath LLC and its affiliates.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (collectively, the “Terms”) govern your use of the Services. These Terms help define the relationship between you and Photomath. It is important that you read and understand the Terms because to use the Services you must accept these Terms. If you do not accept or understand the Terms, please do not use, download, access or register with the Services. Besides these Terms, we also publish a privacy policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://photomath.com/privacy">photomath.com/privacy</a>. We encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage and delete your information.</p>

Not cheating.</p>

<h2 id="10-purchases-and-payments">10. Purchases and Payments</h2>
<p>Photomath makes certain premium features or content, including Photomath Plus, available for purchase (each a “Paid Service”). The Paid Services will be billed through Google Play Store or iOS App Store. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a subscription) you will enter into a separate contract for that particular Paid Service on these Terms.</p>
<p>No cost trials</p>
<p>We may offer no-cost trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you purchase a Paid Service that includes access to a trial, you will receive access to the Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period. Please note that if you purchase a subscription for a Paid Service that includes a no-cost trial, the period during which you can exercise a withdrawal right (and request a refund if applicable) begins at the beginning of the trial, not when you are subsequently billed for the subscription.</p>
<p>Cancellations and refunds</p>
<p>You may cancel a Paid Service by following the steps outlined <a href="https://support.google.com/photomath/answer/14336662?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;sjid=7719773808626505509-EU">here</a>. Once you’ve cancelled, you won’t be charged again and your benefits will continue until the end of the billing cycle. After that point, you will no longer be able to use your benefits.</p>
<p>Paid Services purchased through the Google Play Store are subject to the refund process and policies located at:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637</a>. Paid Services purchased through the iOS App Store are subject to the refund process and policies located at:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084</a>. Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, or the Google Play Store and iOS App Store refund policies, if you cancel a Paid Service you will not be eligible for a refund (or any alternative remedy) unless the Paid Services are defective, unavailable, or don’t perform as stated.</p>
<p>Price increases</p>
<p>When you purchase a Paid Service, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of a recurring Paid Service, such as a subscription, increases later, we will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you following such notice, provided that you have been given at least 30 days’ prior notice before the change is made. If you are given less than 30 days’ prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription prior to the next billing date as described above.</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p>If Photomath is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.</p>

<p>Your national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren’t limited by any other commercial guarantees that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please contact us.</p>
<p>For US-based users only:</p>

FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR FEATURES OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.</p>
<p>For all other users:</p>
<p>We provide our Services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in&nbsp;<a href="#11-legal-guarantee-warranties-and-disclaimers">this warranty</a>, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The only commitments we make about our Services (including the content in the Services, the specific functions of our Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) this warranty section; and (2) laws that can’t be limited by these Terms.</p>
<h2 id="12-translations">12. Translations</h2>
<p>Part of the Service has been translated from English to other languages for your convenience using translation software powered by Google Translate. Reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation, however, no automated translation is perfect nor is it intended to replace human translators. Translations are provided as an ancillary service to users of the Service, and might sometimes be inaccurate. Some content (such as images, videos, Flash, etc.) may not be accurately translated due to the limitations of the translation software.</p>
<p>The official text is the English version of the website. If any questions arise related to the accuracy of the information contained in the translated website, please refer to the English version of the website which is the official version.</p>
<h2 id="13-liability">13. Liability</h2>
<p>These Terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These Terms don’t limit liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
<p>Other than the liabilities described above, we are liable only for our breaches of these Terms, subject to applicable law.</p>
<p>If you’re a business user or an entity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify us for any third-party legal proceedings arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

</li>
<li>
<p>In some jurisdictions the applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in these Terms removes or supersedes your rights as a consumer based on mandatory provisions of law.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="14-entire-agreement">14. Entire Agreement</h2>

<h2 id="15-waiver-and-severability">15. Waiver and Severability</h2>
<p>Our failure to exercise any rights under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h2 id="16-governing-law-and-resolution-of-disputes">16. Governing Law and Resolution of Disputes</h2>
<p>If you’re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, these Terms and your relationship with Photomath under these Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts.</p>
<p>If you’re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution Platform, which we accept if required by law.</p>
<p>If you are not a resident of or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland or an EEA-based consumer, then California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Photomath consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
<h2 id="17-assignment">17. Assignment</h2>
<p>We may transfer our obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time without your consent as long as it does not reduce your guarantees.</p>
<h2 id="18-termination">18. Termination</h2>

If you believe your access to the Service has been suspended or terminated in error, please contact us. Upon termination of the Service or a part thereof, your license to use the Service or a part thereof will be automatically terminated. Following termination, all such terms that by their nature may survive termination of these Terms shall be deemed to survive such termination.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re always free to stop using our Service at any time. If you’re an EEA/UK-based consumer, you can also withdraw from these Terms within 14 days of accepting them.</p>

You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
<p>Effects of withdrawalIf you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
