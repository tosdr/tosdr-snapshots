<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>4.2.    Booking a Seat <span style="font-weight: 400;">when carpooling</span></h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar has set up a system for booking Seats online ( “<strong>Booking</strong>”) for Trips offered on the Platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The methods of booking of a Seat depend on the nature of the Trip envisaged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlaBlaCar provides to users on the Platform a search engine based on different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates, number of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are provided on the search engine when the user is connected with his/her Account. BlaBlaCar invites the user, regardless of the booking process used, to carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the offer that is most adapted to his/her needs. The Customer, booking a Bus Trip on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the desk agent to do the search.</span></p>
<p><strong>4.2.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carpooling Trip</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Passenger is interested in a Carpooling Advert benefiting from Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After receipt of the payment by BlaBlaCar and validation of the Booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking confirmation (the “<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any Booking request within the  timeframe specified by the Passenger during the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the Booking request, if any.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time of the Booking Confirmation, BlaBlaCar will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver), if the Member agreed to display his/her phone number. You are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member.</p>
<p><strong>4.2.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus Trip</span></strong></p>

BlaBlaCar does not provide any transport services with regards to Bus Trips, the Bus Operators are solely party to the GT&amp;Cs of Sale. You recognize that the booking of Seats for a given Bus Trip is subject to the GT&amp;Cs of Sale of the relevant Bus  Operator. </span></p>

The Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to BlaBlaCar and the other Members participating in the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpooling Trip or to the Bus Operator, where applicable</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, BlaBlaCar allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party. In this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the Booking, the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat. It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone for a Carpooling Trip. In the case where you are reserving a seat Carpooling Trip for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals. It is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, it is prohibited to publish a Carpooling Advert for a Driver other than you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.1.2 Regarding the Bus Trip, the Price per Seat is defined at the Bus Operator sole’s discretion.

The user will be informed before any application of the Service fees, when required. The methods of calculation of the Service Fees in force that can be found <a href="https://blog.blablacar.co.uk/blablalife/lp/service-fee">here</a> are provided for<span style="font-weight: 400;"> information purposes only and do not have contractual value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. BlaBlaCar reserves the right to modify at any time the methods of calculation of the Service fees.

<p style="text-align: justify;">When using the Platform for cross-border trips or out of the United Kingdom, the Service Fees may be charged by an affiliate company of BlaBlaCar operating the local platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>5.3.    Rounding</h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You recognise and accept that BlaBlaCar may, at its full discretion, round up or down </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to integers or decimals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Service Fees and the Cost Contribution.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>5.4.    Methods of payment and repayment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver or the Price to Bus Operators</h3><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The transfer will be performed by Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the applicable time limitation periods as defined in the applicable laws, any sum of Cost Contribution not claimed by you as a Driver via Hyperwallet Payment Solution shall be deemed to belong to BlaBlaCar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These procedures may include identity checks and other requirements of the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure based on the criteria established by Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider. These criteria may include financial thresholds depending on the total amount of pay-outs of Cost Contribution you make.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For KYC check purposes, you may be asked to provide additional information as requested by the Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider. If you fail to provide the required documents, you will not be able to receive the Cost Contribution until your identity is confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There may be situations when Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider must, in accordance with applicable laws, suspend the transfer of Cost Contribution or the access to Payment Solution. BlaBlaCar has no influence over such actions of Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The KYC checks carried out by Hyperwallet Payment Solution Provider are distinct and independent of the verifications that BlaBlaCar may carry out in relation to the use of Platform in accordance with these Terms and Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.4.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment of the Price</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any Order made through the Platform is made by one of the means authorized below. The Customer has the option of saving the information relating to one or more credit cards in his/her Customer Account so that he or she does not have to systematically enter this information when making subsequent payments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The means of payment can vary depending on the BlaBlaCar platform you use. The authorized means of payment are as follows: </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Order confirmation shall be issued before the full and effective payment of the price of the Transport Services selected by the Customer. If the payment is irregular, incomplete or not made for any reason attributable to the Customer, the Order shall be cancelled immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Order is confirmed by sending an e-mail to the Customer containing the details of the Order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Passenger is invited to check the settings for the inbox of his/her e-mail address and in particular to ensure that the confirmation e-mail is not sent directly to Spam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirmation of the Order is final. Consequently, any changes will result in either an exchange or cancellation under the conditions of the applicable GT&amp;Cs of Sales. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that the Transport Services are chosen in accordance with the Passenger’s needs and expectations. The accuracy of the Personal Information entered by the Customer is the responsibility of the latter except in the event of BlaBlaCar proven failure to collect, store or protect such Personal Information.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>6.    Non-commercial and non-business purpose of the Services and the Platform</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree to use the Services and the Platform only to be put into contact, on a non-business and non-commercial basis, with people wishing to share a Carpooling Trip with you or to book a Seat in the context of a Bus Trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip. You are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs) notably by referring to the applicable tax scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform. You agree to provide to BlaBlaCar, on its simple request, a copy of your car registration certificate and/or any other document showing that you are authorised to use this vehicle on the Platform and are not drawing any profit therefrom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&amp;Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to BlaBlaCar that you are generating a profit on the Platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>7.    Cancellation policy</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>7.1.    Terms of repayment in the case of cancellation</h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Carpooling Trips are the subject of this cancellation policy; BlaBlaCar does not offer any guarantee, of any nature, in the case of a cancellation for any reason. In the context of Bus Trip, the cancellation policy is subject to the GT&amp;Cs of Sale of the Bus Operators. The customer is invited to refer to the relevant GT&amp;Cs of Sale to acknowledge the conditions of exchanges and cancellation of his/her Bus Trip.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cancellation of a Seat on a Carpooling Trip by the Driver or the Passenger after Booking Confirmation is subject to the stipulations hereunder:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of cancellation owing to the Driver, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the sum paid (i.e. the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees). This is notably the case when Driver cancels a Carpooling Trip or has not arrived at the meeting point 15 minutes after the agreed time;</p>
<p>In the case of cancellation owing to the Passenger:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the Passenger cancels more than 24 hours before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, the Passenger shall only be refunded the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and more than thirty minutes after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger shall be refunded half the Cost Contribution paid at the time of Booking, the Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar, and the Driver will receive 50% of the Cost Contribution via the Hyperwallet Payment Solution;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time, as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and thirty minutes or less after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the Cost Contribution via the Hyperwallet Payment Solution. The Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels after the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, or if he has not arrived at the meeting place 15 minutes after the agreed time, no refund shall be issued. The Driver shall be compensated with the whole of the Cost Contribution via the Hyperwallet Payment Solution and the Service Fees are kept by BlaBlaCar.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a cancellation occurs before departure and owing to the Passenger, the Seat(s) cancelled by the Passenger shall be automatically made available to other Passengers, who may book them online and they are accordingly subject to the conditions of these T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar appreciates, in its sole discretion, on the basis of the available information, the legitimacy of the refund requests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>7.2.    Right of withdrawal</h3><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>4.2.    Booking a Seat <span style="font-weight: 400;">when carpooling</span></h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar has set up a system for booking Seats online ( “<strong>Booking</strong>”) for Trips offered on the Platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The methods of booking of a Seat depend on the nature of the Trip envisaged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlaBlaCar provides to users on the Platform a search engine based on different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates, number of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are provided on the search engine when the user is connected with his/her Account. BlaBlaCar invites the user, regardless of the booking process used, to carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the offer that is most adapted to his/her needs. The Customer, booking a Bus Trip on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the desk agent to do the search.</span></p>
<p><strong>4.2.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carpooling Trip</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Passenger is interested in a Carpooling Advert benefiting from Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After receipt of the payment by BlaBlaCar and validation of the Booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking confirmation (the “<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any Booking request within the  timeframe specified by the Passenger during the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the Booking request, if any.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time of the Booking Confirmation, BlaBlaCar will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver), if the Member agreed to display his/her phone number. You are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member.</p>

You recognize that the booking of Seats for a given Bus Trip is subject to the GT&amp;Cs of Sale of the relevant Bus  Operator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlaBlaCar draws your attention to the fact that certain Transport Services offered by the Bus Operator and mentioned on the Website may be withdrawn, in particular for climactic reasons, seasonal pic, or in the event of force majeure. </span></p>

The Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to BlaBlaCar and the other Members participating in the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpooling Trip or to the Bus Operator, where applicable</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, BlaBlaCar allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party. In this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the Booking, the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat. It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone for a Carpooling Trip. In the case where you are reserving a seat Carpooling Trip for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals. It is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When using the Platform for cross-border trips or out of the United Kingdom, the Service Fees may be charged by an affiliate company of BlaBlaCar operating the local platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>5.3.    Rounding</h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You recognise and accept that BlaBlaCar may, at its full discretion, round up or down </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to integers or decimals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Service Fees and the Cost Contribution.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>5.4.    Methods of payment and repayment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver or the Price to Bus Operators</h3><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.4.2.</strong>    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Payment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree to use the Services and the Platform only to be put into contact, on a non-business and non-commercial basis, with people wishing to share a Carpooling Trip with you or to book a Seat in the context of a Bus Trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip. You are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs) notably by referring to the applicable tax scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform. You agree to provide to BlaBlaCar, on its simple request, a copy of your car registration certificate and/or any other document showing that you are authorised to use this vehicle on the Platform and are not drawing any profit therefrom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&amp;Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to BlaBlaCar that you are generating a profit on the Platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>7.    Cancellation policy</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>7.1.    Terms of repayment in the case of cancellation</h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Carpooling Trips are the subject of this cancellation policy; BlaBlaCar does not offer any guarantee, of any nature, in the case of a cancellation for any reason. In the context of Bus Trip, the cancellation policy is subject to the GT&amp;Cs of Sale of the Bus Operators. The customer is invited to refer to the relevant GT&amp;Cs of Sale to acknowledge the conditions of exchanges and cancellation of his/her Bus Trip.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cancellation of a Seat on a Carpooling Trip by the Driver or the Passenger after Booking Confirmation is subject to the stipulations hereunder:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of cancellation owing to the Driver, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the sum paid (i.e. the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees). This is notably the case when Driver cancels a Carpooling Trip or has not arrived at the meeting point 15 minutes after the agreed time;</p>
<p>In the case of cancellation owing to the Passenger:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the Passenger cancels more than 24 hours before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, the Passenger shall only be refunded the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and more than thirty minutes after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger shall be refunded half the Cost Contribution paid at the time of Booking, the Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar, and the Driver receives 50% of the Cost Contribution;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time, as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and thirty minutes or less after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by BlaBlaCar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If the Passenger cancels after the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, or if he has not arrived at the meeting place 15 minutes after the agreed time, no refund shall be issued. The Driver shall be compensated with the whole of the Cost Contribution and the Service Fees are kept by BlaBlaCar.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a cancellation occurs before departure and owing to the Passenger, the Seat(s) cancelled by the Passenger shall be automatically made available to other Passengers, who may book them online and they are accordingly subject to the conditions of these T&amp;Cs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BlaBlaCar appreciates, in its sole discretion, on the basis of the available information, the legitimacy of the refund requests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h3>7.2.    Right of withdrawal</h3><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have no right of withdrawal from the time of Booking Confirmation provided the Contract between you and BlaBlaCar consisting of putting you in contact with another Member has been fully executed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to enable the provision of the Services, and in compliance with the purpose of the Platform, you grant BlaBlaCar a non-exclusive licence to use the content and data you provide in the context of your use of the Services (hereinafter referred to as your “<strong>Member Content</strong>”). In order to enable BlaBlaCar to distribute via the digital network and in accordance with any communication protocol (notably internet and mobile network), and to provide the content of the Platform to the public, you authorise BlaBlaCar, for the whole world and throughout the duration of your contractual relations with BlaBlaCar, to reproduce, represent, adapt and translate your Member Content as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>12.    Role of BlaBlaCar</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Platform constitutes an online mobility platform on which the Members can create and post Carpooling Adverts for Carpooling Trips for the purposes of ridesharing. These Carpooling Adverts can notably be viewed by the other Members to find out the terms of the Trip, and where applicable, to directly book a Seat in the vehicle in question with the Member having posted the Advert on the Platform. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform also allows the Booking of Seats for Bus Trips.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In using the Platform and in accepting these T&amp;Cs, you recognise that BlaBlaCar is not party to (i) any agreement entered into between you and the other Members with a view to sharing the costs relating to a Trip <span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) nor to any agreement concluded between you and a Bus Operator</span>.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">(ii)    cancellation or modification of a Trip by a Member <span style="font-weight: 400;">or by a Bus Operator;</span></li>

Any modification to these T&amp;Cs will be published on the Platform with mention of the date of effect, and you will be notified by BlaBlaCar before it takes effect.</p>
