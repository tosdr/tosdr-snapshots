<p id="data-choices"><strong>Choices About Your Data</strong></p>



<p><strong>Profile Access and Data Sharing</strong>. You may access and update your profile information, such as your user name, address, or billing information, and may change some of your data sharing preferences on your account page.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Location and Device Permissions</strong>. You may control location tracking by adjusting your location services options on the “Settings” app on your mobile device.&nbsp; We may continue to approximate your location based on your IP address when you access the services through a computer or device. If you would like to update your device content access permissions, such as permissions to access your camera, you can do so in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; app on your mobile device.</p>



<p><strong>Promotional Messages</strong>. You can stop receiving promotional email communications from us by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in such communications.&nbsp; We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may still receive service-related communications, including account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the services, and technical and security notices.</p>



<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising</strong>. We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. To learn more about our advertising practices and your choices relating to advertising, please see “<a href="#third-party">Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p id="third-party"><strong>Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies&#8221;), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, geolocation, and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an e-mail address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p>



<p>We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) or work with third-party partners who use tracking technologies or statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.</p>



<p>In some of our offerings, including our mobile applications, we provide you with the option of logging in using an account that you may have with a social-media service, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. For this type of log-in, you will be directed to the appropriate social-media log-in page, where you will enter your username and password (or account credentials) for the social-media service. (Through a social-media log-in, the social media service may know when you have used our offering.) The social media-service will then send us a token, which we will use to authenticate you for access. The social-media service may also share your name and email address with us, although we will not have access to your social-media account credentials. We may keep the token and your name and email address for purposes of identifying you, which enables us to maintain your preferences in our offering across different devices. As an example, by identifying you using this information, we can present to you your previous searches and saved properties in our mobile applications, even if you access the applications from different devices.  Keeping this information also makes it possible for us to pre-populate your name and email in certain interfaces, such as log-in fields or contact forms.      </p>



<p><strong>Your Choices</strong> </p>



<p>As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You may be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).&nbsp; Please note that opt-outs are browser specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser, or device. Moreover, if you buy a new device, use a different browser, or clear all your cookies, you will have to opt out all over again. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Note that some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.</p>

<p><em>Retention of Personal Data&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>We strive to retain your personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.

<p>To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.</p>

When you discontinue the use of our services, we will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.</p>



<p>Once retention of your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal data or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.</p>
