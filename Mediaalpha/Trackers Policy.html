                    In response to your request we will also display to you the advertisers’ advertisements (e.g., online ads, products or services information, rates, or other relevant information or content) in our marketplace to you. By clicking on one of these advertisements, you will navigate to that advertiser’s website or app and, we will share the information we collected about you and the advertisement you clicked on as part of your navigation to their website or app. Once you are on the advertiser’s website or app, they may ask you to provide additional information so they may further assist you with your request. To improve your experience and interaction with the advertiser, you may see the information you asked us to share with them pre-populated on the advertiser’s website such as in their webform on their website. For <a class="js-story-modal" href="javascript:void(0);">example</a>, if you complete one of our web forms to connect with advertisers offering health insurance, we will display to you the top matches to your request that we can find from our network of advertisers. When you click on one of the advertisements, you will navigate to that advertiser’s website where they have pre-filled the information you asked us to share in their online form.

            <p>When you use our marketplaces to request rates or quotes for health insurance from our network of advertisers or to learn more about their health insurance products and services, we will, depending on the type of health insurance and coverage you are inquiring about, ask you questions on whether certain health conditions may be applicable to you or your household such as whether you or your spouse is pregnant, has a history of tobacco use, cardiovascular disease, or other health conditions. This is typically in the form of yes or no questions (e.g., Are you or your spouse pregnant? or Do any of the following medical conditions apply to you or your spouse?). We may also ask you questions related to your physical condition such as your height and weight.</p>
            <p>This type of information may reveal a physical or mental health diagnosis or condition and may be considered “sensitive information” (also known as sensitive personal information) under certain privacy laws, rules, and regulations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Process your request to connect you with our network of advertisers to learn more about their products and services that interest you, to receive a quote or rates from them, or to purchase their products and services directly from them.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you, including by phone calls, email, mail, and text messages. For <a data-tcpa-modal="//dhe4oz50378wj.cloudfront.net/img/privacy-policy/contact-information-3.png" href="javascript:void(0);">example</a>, when you provide your contact information to us you are registering to receive communications from us directly or through a third-party which may include using the those communication methods to:
            <ul>
                <li>Share information about our services (including about our marketplaces).</li>
                <li>Share information about an advertiser’s products and services that we think may interest you. For example, if you request to be added to any of our mailing lists, we will periodically send you newsletters and other emails with offers and promotions. Our emails will always identify MediaAlpha or one of our branded sites as the sender. You may unenroll any time by selecting “unsubscribe” in our emails.</li>
                <li>Communicate with you to process your request.</li>
                <li>Respond to your inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remember your settings, choices, and the information you inputted into our marketplaces to provide you with our services and a personalized experience. For example, when you begin completing one of our web forms, we will remember the information you provided as you complete the form to personalize and improve your experience. This way if you need to stop and return later to complete the form you do not need to start over again.</li>
        <li>Provide you with relevant advertisements and content from our network of advertisers based on your request, your activity on our services, and your activity on other sites and services not operated by us (this is based on <a href="#info-recieved-from-other-sources">Information we receive from advertisers, business partners, third parties, and other sources</a>). For example, when you use our web forms to make a request for a quote or rates from our network of advertisers, we will show you the top matches. The matches displayed to you can be based on different factors such as the nature of your request, the type of product and services of the advertiser, and ultimately whether the advertiser bid on and won the right to display their rates, quotes, product and service information, or other content to you. If you select one of the matches you will navigate to their website where you may provide the advertiser with additional information so they can provide a more detailed quote to you or for you to purchase the product or service. The advertiser will communicate some of this information back to us so we can show you their quote or rates and so we are able to understand whether they processed your request and whether your interaction with them was successful.
        </li>
        <li>Advertise, promote, and market our business, our services, and our marketplaces on or by using other third-party websites, apps, and products and services (e.g., social media and other online publishers, messaging, email, radio, television and other multi-media, postal mail, etc.).</li>
        <li>Provide and improve our services (including monitoring, analyzing, and improving the operation, delivery, performance, and usability of our marketplaces), ad placement, ad targeting, and ad campaign success and measurement, including through the use of your location information (e.g., city, state, region, country), both on and off our marketplaces. See <a href="#cookies-and-technologies">Cookies and Other Technologies</a> to learn more about our advertising practices and your choices.</li>
        <li>Develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our services, including our marketplaces.</li>
        <li>Monitor and analyze trends and usage of our services.</li>
        <li>Aggregate information we receive from you and third parties to help us understand individual needs, customize our services and offerings, and provide better service.</li>
        <li>Conduct research and analytics designed to help us understand our customers and improve and grow our business, products, services, and customer experience.</li>
        <li>Enhance our services (including our marketplaces) and your experience with them by using information we collect automatically by <a href="#cookies-and-technologies">Cookies and Other Technologies</a>.</li>
        <li>Enhance the safety and security of our services.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>By submitting your request, you agree that we and our advertisers may contact you by phone (including through automated calling, live operators, or using recorded messages), text messages, email, or postal mail (the methods used to contact you will be based on the information you provide and the consent we receive from you), to process your request or to market products and services that might be of interest to you, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List (administered by the Federal Trade Commission) or any similar mechanism to opt-out of receiving phone calls or email or texts. If you later wish to not to be contacted by any advertiser, then you will need to contact such advertiser directly to make a request (read the advertiser’s privacy policy to learn how to exercise your privacy choices with such advertiser).</li>
                    <li>The categories of information we share with advertisers depends on the marketplaces you are using and the nature of your request, the advertisers products and services you are interested in, and the type of quote and rates you are requesting.

                    <li>The information you ask us to share with advertisers and the information you provide directly to such advertisers is subject to each advertiser’s privacy policy.

We call these our business partners including our third-party vendors, suppliers, service providers, lead aggregators, and other third parties we work with. We share the information we have about you with our business partners under the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To help us advertise, promote, and market our business, our services and our marketplaces on or by using other third-party websites, apps, and products and services (e.g., social media and other online publishers, messaging, email, radio, television and other multi-media, postal mail, etc.).</li>
                <li>To measure and optimize the performance of our business, our services, and marketplaces including ad performance and delivery so we can deliver more relevant ads in our marketplaces and ads we may place on other third-party websites, apps, and products and services.</li>
                <li>To optimize our services and marketplaces so our network of advertisers are able to more easily reach their desired audience and market by sharing aggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified, and aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you).</li>
                <li>To help us and others prevent fraud, which may include sharing device, usage, and other information we have about you.</li>
                <li>For legal, safety, and security reasons. This means we may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:

                        <li>Comply with any valid legal process, governmental or law enforcement request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation (e.g., subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential violations of our <a href="terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw" >Terms of Use</a>.</li>

            Keep in mind, we have agreements with our vendors, suppliers, service providers, contractors, and consultants requiring them to secure any personal information we provide to them, limit how they use such information, and comply with national, state, and other applicable privacy laws, rules, and regulations.

    <h2 id="how-third-party">How do third-party content, links, and integrations in our marketplaces work?</h2>

    <p>Our marketplaces contain various forms of advertisements from our network of advertisers which may be presented to you in different ways including as online ads, text, video, or other interactive content, products and services information, rates, quotes, links, etc. (<a data-tcpa-modal="//dhe4oz50378wj.cloudfront.net/img/privacy-policy/insurer-ads-2.png" href="javascript:void(0);">Example</a>). For example, when you submit information through our marketplaces, in response to your request to connect with our network of advertisers, advertisements will be displayed to you as content and links to websites owned and operated by participating advertisers. By clicking on these links you will navigate to their website or app where you may learn more about their products and services, request a quote or rates from them, purchase products and services from them, or communicate with them. As noted above, when you click on an advertisement displayed to you, you will be providing information to the advertiser and any providers acting on their behalf as well as to us and our business partners. We are not responsible for how an advertiser and any other third parties collects or uses your information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use. To learn more, see <a href="#policy-not-cover">What does this Policy not cover?</a> and <a href="#sharing-information-info">How and when we share the information we collect about you?</a></p>

    <h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-the-info">How long do we keep the information we collect?</h2>

    <p>How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the purpose for which it was provided and the purposes for which the information is used, whether we are able to obtain the business objective by other means, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations, and other similar factors.</p>

    <p>Generally, we retain the information we collect about you only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill each purpose for which it was collected. For example, we keep the information we collect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Through our marketplaces (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.</li>
        <li>For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</li>
        <li>For as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements.</li>
        <li>If it is aggregated, anonymized, and/or de-identified (i.e., no longer or otherwise not capable of identifying you) then indefinitely.</li>
        <li>In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as permitted by applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If necessary, however, we may retain the information we collect about you for longer periods of time after the set retention periods and deadlines expire such as where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority. We may also retain information for longer periods of time as necessary to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.</p>

    <p>Once retention of the information we collect about you is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete, aggregate, anonymize, or de-identify the information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information is stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the information we have collected about you and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.</p>

    <p>If you ever decide to stop using our marketplaces, you may ask us to delete your information (see <a href="#choices-and-control">Your Choices and Controls</a> to learn more).</p>

    <p>Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other <a href="terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw" >Terms of Use</a> violations, or if your use of our marketplaces or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other <a href="terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw" >Terms of Use</a> violations.</p>

    <h2 id="keep-information-secure">How do we keep the information we collect about you secure?</h2>

    <p>The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we aggregate, de-identify, anonymize, or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.</p>

    <p>Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information we collect and you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.</p>

    <p>Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your information, please <a href="privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw#contact-us" >Contact Us</a>.</p>

If you feel that you are subject to GDPR or similar law in the EEA/UK, but we have nonetheless used cookies in connection with your visit without consent (which may be due to a failure of the third party geolocation tools, your use of a proxy server, your location outside of the EEA/UK at the time of your visit, or some other factor beyond our control) please notify us through our <a href="privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw#contact-us" >Privacy Center</a> (select “Contact Us” in the dropdown menu of the submission form) and make sure to include any relevant details so that we can ensure proper treatment of your data.</li>
