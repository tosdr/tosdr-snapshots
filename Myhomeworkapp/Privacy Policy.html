  <h2 class="lb-title">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p class="revision-info">Last changed on <span class="revision-dt">May 14th, 2018</span></p>
  <h3 id="basics">The Basics</h3>
  <p>This document describes the privacy policy for myHomework. By using any of the myHomework applications or services you are agreeing to this policy, which is considered part of the myHomework <a href="/terms">terms of use</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="ssl">Secure Transport</h3>
  <p>When you sign into the myHomework website or sync your application(s) with the web, we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> to ensure your information is encrypted as it travels over the internet. If you're using a modern web browser, look for the green bar!</p>
  <h3 id="signup_info">Information Collected During Signup</h3>
  <p>During the signup process for a myHomework account, we capture a few basic pieces of information about you.  Here is a description of each data element we ask for and why we ask for it:</p>
  <dl class="info-defs">
   <dt>email</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>If you choose not to sign up with Facebook or Google there are a few different reasons we ask for your email address to create an account:</p>
    <ul class="info-list">
     <li>We allow you to sign into myHomework applications with your email address because for most people it's easier to remember than a username.</li>
     <li>Should you forget your password, we can email you a link for resetting your password.</li>
     <li>So you can be notified should any settings on your account be changed.</li>
     <li>To make it easier to get Kiip rewards. Having your email address on your account means claiming a reward is usually as simple as pressing a button.</li>
     <li>We can let you know about updates to the myHomework apps and services and participate in surveys. You can unsubscribe from these types of emails from your <a href="/settings/email">email settings</a>.</li>
    </ul>
   </dd>
   <dt>age / dob</dt>
   <dd><p>You must be at least 13 years old to create a myHomework account.  <a href="/terms_young_users">What about younger students?</a></p></dd>
   <dt>geographic location</dt>
   <dd><p>When possible we attempt to capture your geographic location when you sign up for your account, sync with myhomeworkapp.com or make other interactions with the service. We do this to help filter content appropriate to your location, such as showing schools and teachers nearby. We also use location to help detect any invalid use of the myHomework applications and services.</p></dd>
   <dt>preferred timezone</dt>
   <dd><p>We attempt to capture your timezone when you create your account so that times are displayed in your timezone. When we're unable to determine your preferred timezone, we default to the &quot;US/Eastern&quot; timezone. You can change your timezone preference at any time by visiting your <a href="/settings/">settings page</a>.</p></dd>
   <dt>application</dt>
   <dd><p>The application you use to sign up for an account or to use myHomework services is captured so that we know how to sync data between the application(s) you use and the website.</p></dd>
   <dt>device information</dt>
   <dd><p>Information about the device(s) you use to access the myHomework applications and services is captured to uniquely identify your devices for sync and to detect potential abuse of the system. This includes device identifiers, operating system versions, web browser information, ip addresses, device names and types.</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>We use this information to help improve your myHomework experience. We will <em>not</em> share this information with a 3rd party (such as a myHomework sponsor)or with other users in a way that reveals your identity  unless you tell us to or if we are required to by law. We hate spam as much as you do, so no need to worry about giving us your email address.</p>
  <h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3>
  <p>You can use your Facebook and/or Google account to sign into your myHomework account. For those without Facebook or Google accounts or those opting not to use either of those identities, you can enter a password when you create a myHomework account. Your myHomework password can be changed at any time by visiting your <a href="/settings/">settings page</a>. Keep in mind the following:</p>
  <ul class="info-list">
   <li>It is important to choose a strong password that is not easy for a computer or someone that knows you well to guess.</li>
   <li>The name of your pet, best friend or favorite sports team might not be a good choice.</li>
   <li>Adding non-number/non-letter characters such as @, ?, #, $, % or ^ can help make your password harder to guess, but also harder to remember. Using one or perhaps two of those characters might be a good idea.</li>
   <li>We block some extremely obvious passwords, such as "123456" or "abcdef". That is because computer &quot;hackers&quot; can write simple programs that guess the most common simple passwords and try them on a large list of usernames.</li>
   <li>Do not assume that since we do not block a password you chose that it means you chose a &quot;strong&quot; password.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After you choose your password we store it encrypted in our database(s). We will never email it to you and we discourage you from using any service that does something like that.</p>
  <h3 id="site_analytics">Analytics</h3>
  <p>The myHomework apps currently use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to provide information about its visitors. Each page on the site and apps include a small script that sends basic device information to Google, which is displayed in a dashboard for us to analyze. We use the data to understand things like what type of web browsers or mobile devices our users are using, how often users visit the site, which pages users spend the most time on and what application flows might need to be improved. If you want to learn more, you can read the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Privacy Overview</a>, which includes information about how to opt-out of Google Analytics if you want to.</p>
  <p>Although we have no current plans to, we do reserve the right to use a different analytics solution at some point. Should that day come, we will update this policy with information about the change.</p>
  <h3 id="tiosharing">Teachers.io</h3>
  <p>Teachers.io is also owned and operated by instin, LLC.</p><p><a href="https://teachers.io/" target="_blank">Teachers.io</a> allows teachers to share information about themselves and their classes so myHomework users can join their class and automatically download the information the teacher shares. Currently when you join a class, the only information the teacher sees is to help identify & understand the basic usage of the myHomework users that have joined their class and includes username, email, and names if available.  Additional information regarding your usage of myHomework may be shared with teachers at your school provided that you have granted your school access to the information by either signing up with your school owned account or explicitly granting permission in myHomework.</dd>
  <h3 id="breaches">Data Breaches</h3>
  <p>myHomework complies with relevant laws regarding data breaches. In the event that we become aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party of your user data where that data is being or is likely to be used for an unauthorized purpose, we will promptly notify you so that you can take appropriate steps.</p>
  <h3 id="sharing">3rd Parties & advertisements</h3>
  <p>myHomework does not provide any personally-identifying information to advertisers or 3rd parties.</p>
  <p>myHomework may embed, provide links to and/or refer you to third party tutoring and/or educational websites, mobile applications and/or service providers including, but not limited to, Mentored.com and Kiip. myHomework has no control over such third party websites, mobile applications and/or service providers, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that myHomework is not responsible for the availability of such third party websites, mobile applications and/or service providers. Furthermore, myHomework does not endorse, and is not responsible or liable for, any terms and conditions, privacy policies, content, advertising, services, products and/or other materials at or available from such third party websites, mobile applications and/or service providers, or for any damages and/or losses arising therefrom.</p>
  <p>When other types of advertisements are shown within myHomework apps & services, they are provided by 3rd party advertising networks and myHomework does not have direct control over the advertisements displayed.</p>
  <dl class="info-defs">
    <dt><a href="https://www.kiip.me/" target="_blank">Kiip</a></dt>
    <dd>This service provides myHomework users with rewards for doing things like completing their assignments on time and actively keeping their school work organized. If you have rewards enabled, Kiip may ask for informaiton like your email, gender, and age/dob to filter rewards that are appropriate for you. If you do not want rewards, you can easily disable them from your <a href="/settings/kiip">Kiip settings</a>.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>We may add more 3rd party services over time.</p>
  <h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>
  <p>The current version of the myHomework privacy policy can be found at myhomeworkapp.com/privacy. We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. If we deem the revision is significant (e.g. not a typo fix or trivial clarification), we'll include a summary of the changes on this page.</p>
  <p>If you continue to use a myHomework application or service after a privacy policy change, then you are agreeing to abide by the updated policy.</p>
