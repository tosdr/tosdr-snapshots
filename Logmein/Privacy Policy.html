                                This Privacy Policy covers our online and offline interactions with you where we decide how your personal data is processed. For example, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit a GoTo website or application that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “Sites”), when you interact with our Services, or when you contact our support team, speak to our sales representatives, or otherwise interact with GoTo offline.

Throughout this Policy, we use the term “personal data.” This term generally means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked with an identified or identifiable individual. The laws of some jurisdictions, however, define personal data, or a similar term such as personal information, more broadly than this. Other jurisdictions’ laws may exclude certain information about you, such as your business contact details, from the definition of personal data. We will apply the definition of personal data contained in applicable privacy law.

                                Certain data privacy laws provide individuals with rights with respect to the &ldquo;selling&rdquo; or &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of their personal data. GoTo does not currently provide personal data to others in exchange for monetary compensation. Some of these laws, however, define the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of personal data to include disclosures of personal data for commercial activities such as targeted advertising. Privacy laws may also define &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of personal data as providing it to advertising networks and other companies that facilitate digital advertising for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
<br />
<br />
Under that broader definition, in the past 12 months, we have sold certain categories of personal data to, or shared it with, advertising networks and other companies that facilitate digital advertising for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising. These activities allow us to provide more personalized information about our Services to individuals who may be more interested in learning about them. We do not, however, knowingly sell or share the data of minors under the age of 16.
<br />
<br />
We may sell or share the following categories of personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, or otherwise use them for targeted advertising:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>, such as your IP address or other unique identifier and certain contact details;</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial and Financial Information</strong>, such as Services you have considered or purchased from us, and information obtained during GoTo activities and events information or feedback, interests and internet or other electronic activity information;</li>
    <li><strong>Professional or Employment-Related Information; Education History</strong>, such as your job title and educational level;</li>
    <li><strong>Internet or other Electronic Network Information,</strong> including pages of a Site you may visit and your browsing and search history; and</li>
    <li><strong>Inferences, Preferences</strong> and other information.</li>
</ul>
In certain jurisdictions you have the right to opt out of sales and sharing of personal data. To do so, visit our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/818563f9-8d9c-4029-880a-bc743fb49de5" target="_blank">Individual Rights Management Portal</a>.

<strong><em><span style="white-space:pre;">	</span>Data Privacy Framework</em></strong>
<br />
<br />
GoTo complies with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (&ldquo;EU-US DPF&rdquo;), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF (the UK Extension), and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (&ldquo;Swiss-US DPF&rdquo;) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.
<br />
<br />
GoTo Audio, LLC, GoTo Communications, Inc., GoTo Technologies USA, LLC, GoTo Group, Inc., and Grasshopper Group, LLC have certified to the US Department of Commerce that they adhere to (a) the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-US DPF and the UK Extension, and (b) the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and the UK Extension and/or the Swiss-US DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

For personal data transfers from the EU, the UK, and Switzerland to countries whose laws have not been deemed adequate by applicable EU regulatory authorities to that are not covered by GoTo&rsquo;s Data Privacy Framework certifications, GoTo&rsquo;s practice is to enter into data processing addendums that incorporate the European Commission&rsquo;s standard contractual clauses (the &ldquo;SCCs&rdquo;).

<br />
If you are an individual in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we collect and process your personal data as a controller only where we have a legal basis for doing so. We use the following legal bases to process your personal data:
<ul>

For example, we may obtain consent to send certain communications to you, to use cookies when you visit our Sites, or for other purposes that we communicate to you. When we process your personal data with your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of our processing that occurred before you withdrew your consent;</li>
    <li><strong>To Comply With EU, Member State, UK, or Swiss Law.</strong> We process your personal data to help us comply with applicable EU, Member State, Swiss, and UK laws, including tax, privacy, telecommunications and other laws; to communicate with and respond to requests from applicable judicial authorities and tribunals, law enforcement; and other regulators, and to detect, prevent, investigate, and respond to fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, or illegal activity;</li>

</ul>
<strong>Special Category Data</strong>

We generally do not seek to process special category data, and we ask that you not provide it to us unless we specifically ask for it. When we do process such data, we will do so in accordance with EU, Member State, UK and Swiss law, including with your explicit consent, where you have manifestly made it public, where it is necessary to protect your or others&rsquo; vital interests, to defend or pursue legal claims, and where it is necessary to do so for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of EU, Member State, UK, or Swiss law.

    <li><strong>Right to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision Making.</strong> In certain circumstances, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly impacts you.
