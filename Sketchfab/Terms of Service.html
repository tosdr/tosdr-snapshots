Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to these terms and conditions, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sketchfab shall have the right to commence and prosecute any legal or equitable action or proceeding before any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive or other relief against you in the event that, in the opinion of Sketchfab, such action is necessary or desirable. Also notwithstanding the foregoing, a User may at their option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction. Sketchfab does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in the User’s jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>11.3 Class Action Waiver.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to only bring disputes in an individual capacity and shall not: seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of Sketchfab and all parties to all other actions or arbitrations.</p></article><article id="amendment"><h3>12.
