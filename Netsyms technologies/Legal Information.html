                <p>tl;dr: We respect your privacy and just ask you be nice in return.</p>
                <p>Last updated October 27, 2020 to adjust wording of the “Don’t sue us” section.</p>
                <p><strong>This document applies to all Netsyms Technologies products and services.</strong>
This document should be considered our Terms of Service agreement.
If a product or service specifies extra conditions, those also apply.
If a product or service has conditions that contradict this document in part
or in whole, the product-specific terms take precedence over this document.
If you receive official correspondence from Netsyms Technologies directing you
on additional terms and conditions, consider them part of this document.
We will attempt to notify you via email of any major changes to this document.</p>
                <p><strong>You have to agree to these to have an account with us.</strong>
If you don’t agree, immediately terminate use of all our services and products
and contact us. We may be able to grant you an exception for your
particular scenario. Otherwise, we will assist you in deleting your accounts
and information.</p>
                <p><strong>Some content is banned.</strong>
We don’t have to give you space on our servers if we don’t want to.
If we find objectionable content, it will be removed.
Examples of such content: pornography, hate speech, pro-abortion or pro-gay
“marriage” propaganda, illegal or illicit activities, and questionable drug use.
We may remove such content without warning, although we will usually give you
an opportunity to retrieve it before it is permanently deleted.
If you have doubts about your content falling foul of this clause,
contact us and we will decide. You should also read <a href="/beliefs">our beliefs</a>.
This applies to any content that passes through or resides on any of our servers.</p>
                <p><strong>We only store the information essential to your use of our services.</strong>
We don’t like companies tracking us any more than you do.
We only store data you give us, such as files you upload, data you submit in a
form, pages you visit, and your computer’s IP address. You are allowed to use a
pseudonym if you so choose; we only use your name as a “friendly” alternative
to your username. We only retain data as needed to provide you with
services. We never log historical location data; any such data we receive
overwrites the older data. Under normal conditions, we keep server access logs
no longer than one month. Netsyms services may store short-term or
session cookies on your machine; these cookies allow you to log in and expire
when no longer needed. Longer-term cookies may also be used for
analytical purposes, so we can see how our services are being used. Analytical
data does not move outside Netsyms servers, and you cannot be identified with
it. If you don’t want to be tracked at all, enable Do-Not-Track in your web
browser or <a href="/tracking-opt-out">click here</a> to opt out. If you wish to have
your personal information removed from our systems, you want a copy of your
data, or you want to change your information but can’t find a way to do so,
contact us and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
                <p><strong>Your personal data is safe with us.</strong>
We will never sell your information to anybody.
It belongs to you and you own it.
Sometimes we do take a peek to make sure everything goes smoothly for all our
users, but we never tell anyone what we find (unless we find something very
illegal). We like to think we handle your data better than Google or Facebook.</p>
                <p><strong>Source Code.</strong>
Netsyms &lt;3 open source! Our services are open source unless there’s a very
good reason (for example, something that isn’t ready yet). To browse or
download source code, head over to
<a href="https://source.netsyms.com/explore/repos">our Git server</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Online Services.</strong>
We are not responsible in any way for the activities of
users on our online services. Please contact us if a user is affecting the
well-being of the service or other people. Include all relevant information,
detailing everything you can about the incident. You may also contact us for
other issues regarding conduct. We may or may not reply, but appropriate
action will be performed at our discretion. If you are misusing, abusing,
or putting a large amount of strain on our systems, we will ask you to stop
or to pay a small usage fee. If you disregard our requests, we reserve the
right to terminate your account or otherwise block your access.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Services.</strong>
We do not offer a warranty on physical goods, except
as required by law. We can try to contact the vendor we purchased the goods
from for a refund or exchange. If we physically break your computer because
we screwed up, we will fix that for free. You should always backup your data,
even if there is no problem. Because of that, we offer no guarantee that your
digital data will be intact, especially if we are installing an operating
system or cleaning a virus infection. Again, keep backup copies of your
important files.</p>
                <p><strong>Don’t sue us.</strong>
We are not liable if bad stuff happens, even if it’s our software’s fault.
Bugs happen. Or, in lawyer-speak:
Netsyms Technologies’ digital products and services are provided by Netsyms, the
copyright holders, and contributors “as is” and any express or implied
warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed.
In no event shall Netsyms, the copyright holders, or contributors be liable for any
direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages
(including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services;
loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and
on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
(including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of these
digital products and services, even if advised of the possibility of such
damage.</p>
