This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p><h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2><p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Resistbot, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this Service.

The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.</p><p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p><p>The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States.

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h2><h3>A. Governing Law.</h3><p>This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Schenectady County, New York for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Schenectady County, New York is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><h3>B. Arbitration.</h3><p>Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Resistbot. For any dispute with Resistbot, you agree to first contact us at <a class="" rel="noreferrer" href="mailto:terms@resist.bot">terms@resist.bot</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Resistbot has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Schenectady County, New York, unless you and Resistbot agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Resistbot from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p><h3>C. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</h3><p>With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Resistbot are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.</p><h2>13. General</h2><h3>A. Assignment.</h3><p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Resistbot without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p><h3>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</h3><p>Resistbot may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Resistbot in our sole discretion. Resistbot reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Resistbot is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Resistbot may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page and attempt to notify you that material changes have been made to the Agreement. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the updated Agreement. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p><h3>C. No Waiver.</h3><p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Resistbot’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p><h3>D. California Residents.</h3><p>The provider of services is Resistbot Action Fund,<!-- --> <!-- -->802 E.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p></section></main><footer role="contentinfo" class="bg-stone-50 bg-footer bg-cover bg-center py-10 dark:bg-stone-950 dark:bg-blend-hard-light print:hidden"><div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-lg px-6"><nav class="mb-4 flex flex-wrap gap-x-4"><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/">Home</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/premium">Premium</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/premium/coins">Buy Coins</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/guide">Guide</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/petitions">Petitions</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/letters">Open Letters</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/officials">Officials</a><a class="anchor-subtle" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/resistbot">Shop</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/about">Help</a><a class="anchor-subtle" href="/news">News</a></nav><p class="mb-4 text-sm">Resistbot is a free service, but message and data rates may apply if you use the service over SMS.
