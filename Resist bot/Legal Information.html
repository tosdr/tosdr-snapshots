We are an automated chatbot, managed by a group of over 100 volunteers whose mission is to improve the voter participation rate in the United States by engaging citizens year-round and delivering our will to our officials, helping us to vote, and being an ally in our fight to protect what matters to us. In order to continue to drive our mission, which requires your active participation, we want to ensure we earn and keep your trust. This includes making sure we are transparent about our data processing practices – after all, you should be in control of what happens to your personal information (yes, it is your personal information, and not ours!).</p><p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what personal information we collect about you, and how we may use and share that information. Note that we don’t sell your personal information (and don’t intend to in the future – that’s just not what we are about). This Privacy Notice applies to our website https://resist.bot/ (the “Site”) and the Resistbot SMS service (collectively, our “Service”). We may also provide you with additional privacy notices or disclosures where the processing of your personal information would fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy notice or disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time. Please ensure that you have read this Privacy Notice and understood how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information before accessing or using the Service.</p><h2>1. What personal information do we collect and for what purpose?</h2><p>We may collect information, including personal information, in connection with your visits to and use of the Service. This collection includes information that you provide in connection with the Service, information from third parties, and information that is collected automatically such as through the use of cookies and other technologies.</p><h3>Information That You Provide</h3><p>We may collect personal information from you. The categories of information we collect can include:</p><p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> We may collect personal information, such as your name, phone number, birthday, physical address, and e-mail address when you sign up for our mailing list, make a donation, use our service, or otherwise communicate with us. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We also use this information to communicate directly with you, such as to send SMS messages with your consent and to send you email messages. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).</p><p><strong>Payment Information.</strong> If you make a donation on our Site, we collect payment information and any other information provided in connection with your transaction. We use third-party payment processors to process your donations. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third-party processor. The payment processor’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy notice. To view Stripe’s privacy notice, please visit:<!-- --> <a class="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>.

These organizations may have their own rules, policies, and security measures controlling who has access to messages transmitted through their services. We use this information to administer and facilitate our Service.</p><p><strong>Inquiries and Feedback.</strong> If you contact us, we will collect the information that you provide us, such as your contact information and the contents of your communication with us.

We also receive personal information that you provide to us through third party sites you use to communicate with Resistbot, such as Facebook Messenger, Viber, Slack, and Telegram. The data we receive from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Site or Service. We use this information to administer and facilitate our Service.</p><h3>Information from Other Sources</h3><p>From time to time, we may receive information about you from third parties and other users, such as your publicly available voter registration or voter history, and combine this with information previously collected. In these cases, our Privacy Notice governs the handling of the combined personal information.</p><h2>2.
