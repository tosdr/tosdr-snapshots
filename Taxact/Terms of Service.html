You must describe the nature of the Dispute, the basis for your Dispute and the resolution you are seeking.  </p><p>You agree that the term &quot;<b>Dispute</b>&quot; in these Terms and Conditions will have the broadest meaning possible.

If the parties have more than one Dispute between them, you and we agree to assert all such Disputes in a single arbitration so they may be resolved at the same time or they will be deemed waived. </p><p>We agree to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitrator.  If we are unable to agree on an arbitrator, you or we may petition the state or federal courts sitting in Dallas County, Texas to appoint an arbitrator from the arbitrators that you and we propose.  Regardless of the arbitrator or arbitration provider selected, the arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures or other comparable rules to which you and we agree.  </p><p>WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.  The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>You and TaxAct agree that the terms of this Agreement affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.

As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and TaxAct agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and TaxAct will pay the remaining arbitration provider’s fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by TaxAct, TaxAct will pay all of the arbitration provider’s fees and costs. You and TaxAct agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Texas and the United States sitting in Dallas County, Texas have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p><p>Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following Disputes (i) qualifying individual Disputes in small claims court in the county of your or TaxAct’s billing address. and/or (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction in Texas for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property.</p><p><b>Coordinated Disputes</b></p><p>You and we agree that the following procedures apply for Coordinated Disputes.  If twenty-five (25) or more similar Disputes are asserted against TaxAct at or around the same time by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise consistent or coordinated (&quot;<b>Coordinated Disputes</b>&quot;), and your Dispute is one such Dispute, you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.  Further, you agree that TaxAct, in its sole discretion, may elect to opt the Disputes out of arbitration and require the Disputes to proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas consistent with the remainder of this Agreement, including the class and collective action waiver.  Notwithstanding this option available to TaxAct, should the Disputes proceed in arbitration, batching procedures to reduce the costs and gain efficiencies associated with litigating multiple cases shall be implemented. Twenty-six (26) Disputes shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a first batching process, thirteen (13) of which will be selected by the claimants and their coordinated counsel and thirteen (13) of which will be selected by TaxAct. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration provider fees be assessed in connection with those Disputes until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein.  </p><p>If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes after the conclusion of the initial twenty-six proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes through mediation at this time, then twenty-six (26) Disputes shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second batching process, thirteen (13) of which will be selected by the claimants and thirteen (13) of which will be selected by TaxAct. (If there are fewer than twenty-six (26) Disputes remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration provider’s fees be assessed in connection with those Disputes until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. In any batching process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each proceeding, and only four proceedings may be assigned to each arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes after the conclusion of the second batch of twenty-six (26) proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with no more than twenty-six (26) Disputes proceeding at any time in a staged order that is selected randomly or by the arbitration provider, until all the Coordinated Disputes, including your Dispute, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. At any time during these proceedings, we agree to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining Disputes. </p><p>Any applicable statute of limitations on your Disputes and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for Coordinated Disputes from the time any Coordinated Dispute is selected for the first set of batching proceedings until the time your Dispute is selected to proceed in arbitration, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this section regarding Coordinated Disputes and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against TaxAct. Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these Coordinated Dispute procedures, you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith and with the assistance of a process arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the selected arbitration provider to address reductions in arbitration fees. If this Section regarding Coordinated Disputes is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings in accordance with this Section.</p><p><b>Termination of Rights </b></p><p>ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES OR CONTENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND TAXACT WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.</p><p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by sending an email to <a href="mailto:arbitration@taxact.com">arbitration@taxact.com</a>.
