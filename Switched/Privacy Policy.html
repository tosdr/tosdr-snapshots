                <p>1.1. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy notice sets out the basis on which we process any personal data we collect about users of Switched via <a href="/">https://switchedapp.com</a> (the <strong>Website</strong>) or the Switched mobile application available from the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store or our Website (the <strong>App</strong>), and how that information will be processed by us.</p>
                <p>1.2. This privacy notice applies to: visitors to our Website and users of our App who do not register as well as those who do; any customers that purchase services and/or digital content from us via the Website or the App or otherwise; and all individual contractors and service providers who provide services to our business ( <strong>you</strong> ).</p>
                <p>1.3. We are a <strong>data controller</strong>. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you, and for explaining this clearly to you.</p>
                <p>1.4. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@ed2.digital">contact@ed2.digital</a>.</p>
                <p>1.5. Please read this privacy notice carefully to understand what we do with your personal information and what rights you have in relation to our activities.</p>
                <p>1.6. Our Website and our App are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p>
                <h3 id="2-what-is-personal-data-and-our-lawful-basis-for-processing">2. What is personal data and our lawful basis for processing</h3>
                <p>2.1. Personal data, or personal information, means any information relating to an individual from which that person can be identified. There are special categories of more sensitive personal information which require a higher level of protection (see further at section 3.4, below).</p>
                <p>2.2. We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Our principle lawful basis for processing is set out in the table below. However, some of our grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.</p>
                <p>2.3. We may only rely on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) to process your personal information, if your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Where we rely on legitimate interests for our processing, we have set out the relevant interest, below.</p>
                <p>2.4. Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except that:</p>
                <div class="indent1">
                    <p>2.4.1. if you are a private individual, we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message; and</p>
                    <p>2.4.2. we obtain your consent to our processing of your special category information which you voluntarily provide when you sign up and accept the Switched Terms of Use and Service.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
                </div>
                <p>2.5 We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
                <p>2.6. Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
                <p>2.7. Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with services or digital content). In this case, we may have to cancel a service or digital content you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

                <h3 id="3-data-we-collect-about-you">3. Data we collect about you</h3>
                <p>3.1. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
                <p>3.2. We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, last name, title and date of birth.</p>
                <p><strong>Special Category Data</strong> includes sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and sexual preferences and other details of your sex life.</p>

Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will <strong>not</strong> directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>3.4 You are not required to provide to us any <strong>special categories of personal data</strong> about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data) or information about criminal convictions and offences, and we do not seek to collect such information about you from other sources. However you may choose to provide to us special category personal information about your sex life and sexual orientation and your race or ethnicity and you consent to our processing this information when you agree to the Switched Terms of Use and Service.</p>
                <p>3.5 We also may process personal information (including special category information):</p>

                <div class="indent1">
                    <p>5.1.1. Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention.</p>
                    <p>5.1.2. Switched uses an automated artificial intelligence based abuse prevention system to detect and prevent identity fraud, spam, scams and content that breaches our acceptable use policy. The system may make decisions which impact on you including removal of content that you have posted or temporarily or permanently disabling your account.</p>
                    <div class="indent1">
                        <p>a. In detecting spam, scams and content that breaches our acceptable use policy, this automated system only process information about content and your basic account details, and does not use any of your special category personal information.</p>
                        <p>b. In detecting identity fraud, for example to ensure that banned users do not re-register under different account details, this automated system does process your personal information including special category information.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>5.1.3. If the Switched abuse prevention system makes a decision to temporarily or permanently remove any of your content or disable your Switched account, we will inform you in writing by email, and if you object to the decision then you may contact us to request human intervention to review the decision.</p>
                    <p>5.1.4. Switched also uses automated artificial intelligence models for matchmaking, recommendations and customisation. This automated system will process your personal information including Profile Data and Special Category Data to suggest other Switched users you may want to connect with or content that you might be interested in. However, this system will not make any legal or similarly significant decisions, or any decisions that affect your rights or ability to use Switched.</p>
                    <p>5.1.5. We will notify you in writing if we make any further use of automated decision making.</p>

                    <p>5.2.2. We may use your Identity, Special Category, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.</p>
                    <p>5.2.3. You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased products from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
                    <p>5.2.4. We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
