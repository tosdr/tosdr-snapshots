<h2 id="general">How we gather and use information</h2>

<h3>How and what information we gather</h3>

<p>We only collect personal information that you voluntarily give us via email,
web-based fill-in forms and other direct contact from you.</p>

<p>When you use Blumentals Software web site or services, our servers automatically
record information that your browser sends to every website you visit,
such as time of day, browser type, referring Web site address and your
IP address.</p>

<p>When you register for Blumentals Software services, we may ask for information such as
your name, company name and email address. When you place an order online with us,
we may also ask for extra information such as billing address.</p>

<p>When you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, you will be required to provide
your e-mail address and to confirm your subscription by clicking a web link
in your subscription confirmation e-mail.</p>

<p>When you place an order online with us, you may be redirected to an SSL-secured
website operated by our trusted billing merchant (Avangate or Digital River) and
there you will be required to provide personal information (including your credit card details) to our
billing merchant. Information you provide to our billing merchant will
be processed in accordance with its privacy policy (available at the bottom of
billing pages) and you are therefore advised to review such policy prior to purchase.
Blumentals Software will have access to your full name, company name, address
and contact info, but not to your credit card or payment account access data.</p>

<p>We do not collect or store any credit or debit card information.</p>

<h3>How we may use gathered information</h3>

<p>We may use collected personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to provide products and services that you have requested;</li>
    <li>to process your orders, perform billing and notify you of the status of your order;</li>
    <li>to facilitate the renewal of subscriptions for products or services;</li>
    <li>to provide you with an effective customer service;</li>
    <li>for security, anti-piracy, and fraud prevention purposes;</li>
    <li>to provide you with information related to changes in products and services that you are using;</li>
    <li>to provide you with newsletters, special offers and other information where you have consented to receive it;</li>
    <li>to undertake any other promotional activities where you have consented to such promotional activities;</li>
    <li>to comply with or verify compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;</li>
    <li>to re-engage with you on Facebook using Facebook's Custom Audiences feature.</li>
</ul>

<p id="email">If you do not want to receive newsletters, special offers and other information
that is not essential to the use of products and services that you have purchased or subscribed
to <b>you can easily opt-out from future communication</b> at anytime by clicking a link at the
bottom of a message from us or by sending an explicit unsubscribe request to <script>noSpam('support', 'blumentals.net');</script>.</p>

<p>We may use collected non-personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to personalize and support your use of Blumentals Software website, products and services;</li>
    <li>to improve our products, services, customer experience and advertising strategy;</li>
    <li>for security, anti-piracy, and fraud prevention purposes;</li>

    <li>for statistical or research and analysis purposes..</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we may “de-identify” personal information by removing any information that
identifies you specifically, and use the rest for the purposes set forth above.</p>

<p>We may share your information with third-parties in following cases:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>To provide services delivered by our partners.</b>
We may use other companies, which may include but not limited to present or future
corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or
on our behalf and help us to operate our business. In cases where it is necessary
to deliver a service that is carried out by our third-party partner your
information may be transmitted or made available to the partner which provides the
service that you requested.</li>

<li><b>In connection with corporate events.</b>
If a third party has acquired our business or specific assets through which you have provided
information to us, for example, as the result
of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation,
your personal information may become owned by that company in compliance with applicable law.
In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject
to this privacy policy, any applicable supplemental privacy notices, and the privacy preferences
you have expressed to us.</li>

<li><b>To comply with legal requirements, cooperate with law enforcement, prevent crime, and
protect legal rights or Blumentals Software, you and others.</b> To the extent not expressly prohibited
by applicable law, we may disclose the personal information we collect without notifying you
when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) to cooperate with law enforcement
or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement
or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena);
(c) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible crime; (d) to enforce a contract;
to protect and defend the rights or property of Blumentals Software, its corporate affiliates,
and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or
the public in general; or (e) act in situations involving potential threats
to the personal safety of any person.</li>

</ul>

it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented), and as
permitted or required by applicable law.</p>
