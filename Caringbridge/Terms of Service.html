<h2>Individual CaringBridge Sites</h2>

<p>When you use our Service, you may be creating and maintaining, on behalf of yourself or another person, an individual site (“Individual Site”). In order to create an Individual Site on behalf of someone else, you need to have their express permission. If they are not able to provide permission due to their age (e.g., minor child) or circumstances (e.g., illness), you must be authorized to act on behalf of the person for whom the Individual Site is created or have the permission of a person authorized to act on that person's behalf. Access to each Individual Site is controlled by the privacy settings selected by the creator of the Individual Site; more details may be found in our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy and Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<p><em>Deactivation or Deletion of Individual Sites.</em> CaringBridge may, without prior notice, deactivate or delete your Individual Site. Cause for deactivation includes without limitation: (a) breaches or violations of these Terms of Use or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (c) a request by the subject of an Individual Site or a person authorized to represent that person, (d) discontinuance or material modification to the Individual Site (or any part thereof), (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, and (f) extended periods (more than six months) of inactivity. Further, you agree that all terminations for cause will be made in CaringBridge's sole discretion and that CaringBridge will not be liable to you or any third-party for deactivation of an Individual Site.</p>

<p><em>Preservation of Your Individual Site.</em> We recommend that, from time to time, you take steps to preserve your Individual Site so that you will have an archival copy.</p>

<p><a name="security"></a></p>

<h2>Security, Privacy and Cookie Policy</h2>

<p>You may increase the privacy of the Individual Site by making it accessible “By Invitation Only.” This privacy setting can be changed at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to “Site Settings.”</p>

<p><a href="/privacy-policy">Our Privacy and Cookie Policy</a> describes the personal information we collect when you and others use our Service. It also describes how we use the personal information you share with us and some of the steps we take to protect your privacy. Our Privacy and Cookie Policy are part of these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Discoverability: How People Find Your Site</h2>

<p>CaringBridge also offers a public search listing feature that allows you to publish portions of your Individual Site to the public Internet. The publicly visible information may include: (1) the first and last name the subject of the Individual Site; (2) the title of the Individual Site; (3) the profile picture of the Individual Site; (3) the date and time of the first journal post to the Individual Site; and (4) the date and time of the most recent journal post to the Individual Site. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You have the option to activate the public profile feature when you initially create an Individual Site or at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to “Site Settings.”</p>

<p>CaringBridge has no way of knowing and will not be responsible or liable if the individual accessing an Individual Site obtained the website address through improper means. In addition, individuals using our Service must understand that the Internet is inherently insecure, and no website operator can guarantee that a website is secure. CaringBridge does not warrant that our Service, Site, or Individual Site is secure or "hackerproof." You use our Service solely at your own risk.</p>

However, to the extent we have already exercised any of the foregoing license rights with respect to the removed Submissions, such licenses shall not be deemed revoked as to the prior uses. In addition, such licenses shall not be deemed revoked as to any Submissions that have been transmitted to other websites, persons or media. For example, if you have asked us to forward your postings to your Facebook page as soon as we receive them, and we have done so, we have no way to remove them from your Facebook page. Termination of this license does not terminate the license you have granted in any Ideas contained in your Submissions.

In addition, we reserve the right to alter, edit or remove any Submissions, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion. Your Use of Submissions Posted by Others.

<p>Under no circumstances shall CaringBridge or its sponsors be liable in any way for any submissions posted on or made available through an individual site by you or any other user. We do not control, have no obligation to monitor, and are not responsible for what users post on or through our Service and are not responsible for any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, infringing or otherwise objectionable or illegal Submissions you may encounter on our Service or in connection with your use of our Service.</p>

<h2>Copyright and DMCA Take-Down</h2>

<p><em>In General.</em> If you would like us to remove any Submissions from our Service for any reason, please notify us at Customercare@caringbridge.org. While we do not have any obligation to remove Submissions merely because of a removal request, CaringBridge will review all such requests and will remove Submissions that we determine should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use (including our Privacy and Cookie Policy) and applicable law. If you are requesting removal of submissions due to a violation of your copyrights, please follow the procedure described in the "Copyright and DMCA Take-Down" paragraph below.</p>

<p><em>Violation of Copyrights/Copyright Agent.</em> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you are the copyright owner (or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner), please notify our Copyright Agent immediately of any copyright infringement. As soon as we receive your notice of claimed infringement, in the form described below, we will promptly remove or disable access to materials that are claimed to be infringing (or the subject of infringing activity).

<li>A description of the material you believe is infringing or the subject of infringing activity, together with enough information to permit us to locate the material;</li>
<li>Enough information to permit us to contact you, such as, your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address;</li>

<li>A statement that all of the information you have provided is accurate; and</li>
<li>A statement made under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>

<pre><code>Tia Newcomer, CEO

2750 Blue Water Road, Suite 275
Eagan, MN 55121
</code></pre>

<p>Any notification by a copyright owner or a person Authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon CaringBridge actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.</p>

<p><a name="righttomodify"></a></p>

<h2>Right to Modify or Discontinue Service and Sites</h2>

<p>CaringBridge reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service, the Site or Individual Sites (or any part thereof) with or without notice. CaringBridge shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service or Individual Sites.</p>

<p><a name="specialterms"></a></p>

<h2>Special Terms for Special Features of the Service</h2>

<p>When you sign up to use specific functionality or a special feature of our Service, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of that functionality or special feature. In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked "I agree." This type of agreement is known as a "click-through" agreement. If any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of these Terms of Use, the terms of the click-through agreement shall supplement or amend these Terms of Use, but only with respect to the matters governed by the click-through agreement.</p>

<p><a name="linkedsites"></a></p>

<h2>Linked Sites and Social Media</h2>

<p>The Service and Sites may provide links to other websites or resources that are neither controlled nor endorsed by CaringBridge. The Site may also include widgets or buttons that allow you to share, post, retweet or otherwise use content from the Site to interact with other social media platforms (“Social Media Features”). The privacy policy and terms of use for utilizing Social Media Features are governed by the social media platform utilized. CaringBridge is not responsible in any manner for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available on linked sites or through Social Media Features.</p>

<p><a name="fundraising"></a></p>

<h2>Fundraising</h2>

<p>As a charitable 501(c)(3) organization, CaringBridge may invite users to provide charitable donations to CaringBridge. Donations ensure families can use CaringBridge free of charge. CaringBridge will inform users of the opportunity to donate through the Service, within email communications and within direct mail letters. Users can opt-out of email and direct mail letter communications.</p>

<p>From time to time, users will post information on an Individual Site to let other users know how they can contribute money to help someone in need. Our concern is that some of these requests for help may be fraudulent, and our users may be deceived. We cannot review every posting on every Individual Site and have no way of policing these requests or determining their authenticity. Accordingly, we urge you not to respond to any such fundraising requests that may be posted on an Individual Site unless you are absolutely certain, from firsthand knowledge, that the request is legitimate and that your donation will be used in the manner you intend. CaringBridge will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any losses or damages caused or alleged to be caused in connection with your response to any solicitation contained on any individual site. We also want to remind you that contributions made in response to such solicitations posted on Individual Sites are not contributions to CaringBridge and may not be tax deductible.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>

<p>Under no circumstances, shall CaringBridge, or its sponsors, licensors, or service providers, or any of its or their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively, the “released parties”), be liable to you or any third party claiming through you for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with this service, its content (including user submissions), any products or services made available through this service, or your use of or inability to use this service, including any loss or damage due to viruses that may affect your computer equipment, software, data or other property on account of your use of this service or your downloading of any material from this service.</p>

<p>This is a comprehensive limitation of liability that applies to all losses and damages of any kind (whether direct, indirect, general, special, consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise, including, without limitation, loss of data, income, or profits), whether the claim is based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or any other legal theory, even if an authorized representative of CaringBridge or another released party has been advised of or should have known of the possibility of such damages, and without regard to the success or effectiveness of other remedies.</p>

<p>If any part of this limitation of liability is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, then the aggregate liability of CaringBridge, its sponsors, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents, under such circumstances to you or any person or entity claiming through you for liabilities that otherwise would have been limited shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of these limitations of liability may not apply to you.
