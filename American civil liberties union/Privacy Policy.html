	  <p>Effective July 1, 2024</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Inc. (“ACLU, Inc.” or “Union”), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, Inc. (“ACLUF” or “Foundation”), and the ACLU Voter Education Fund (“VEF”) (collectively, “ACLU,” “National,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) work to expand the right to privacy, increase the control individuals have over their personal information, and ensure civil liberties are enhanced rather than compromised by technological innovation. Read more about our ongoing privacy and technology work on <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology">ACLU’s Privacy and Technology issue page</a>.</p>
<p>ACLU is committed to living our values by describing, in plain language, how we collect and use your personal information and by providing clear choices for how we collect and use your personal information. We continually evaluate and improve our privacy and data governance practices to responsibly handle personal information entrusted to us. This may include information about you, whether you are an ACLU supporter or not. We collect information from and about you when you interact with us and we may obtain information about you as an individual member of the public from other sources whether you are an ACLU supporter or not (e.g., you are a registered voter and we have information about you in voter files we use to conduct voter outreach; research on civil liberties issues, such as, voting rights discrimination; or to identify and better understand potential ACLU supporters). In this statement “you” refers to both ACLU supporters and individuals with whom we may not currently have a direct relationship.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes how ACLU collects, uses, shares, or otherwise processes personal information in its day-to-day operations. Certain ACLU programs, as well as ACLU state/local/territory affiliated organizations (“Affiliates”) throughout the United States, have separate privacy statements. Those statements are available here <a href="https://www.aclu.org/about/privacy/aclu-organizations-privacy-statements">ACLU Organizations Privacy Statements</a>. National and Affiliates may be referred to individually and collectively as “ACLU Organizations.” To learn more about the scope of this Statement, applicable regulations, and key definitions, read <a href="#about-this-statement">About This Statement</a>.</p>

<p>We share personal information with your consent, when you direct us to share it with others, as necessary to complete your transactions, or to provide the services you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide credit card information to donate, we will share that data with payment card processors and other entities as necessary to process your payment and to prevent or detect fraud.</p>
<p>We also share personal information with the following types of other parties:</p>

					<h3 id="" class="wp-heading-h3 with-standard">Affiliates</h3>
		
			</div>
  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p>To maximize our impact nationwide, ACLU works together with and shares your personal information with our state/local/territory Affiliates around the United States to create a coherent experience for our supporters, members, and the public. For example, when you become a member of the National Union Organization, you will typically also become a member of the ACLU Organization of the Affiliate in the U.S. state where you reside (based on the mailing address you provide with your donation). We also may co-collect or share your personal information with any affiliated ACLU Organizations.</p>
<p>While the ACLU Organizations adhere to a common set of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/about/privacy/data-privacy-principles">privacy principles</a> and standards for handling personal information that we share with one another, each ACLU Organization may have its own unique data practices that are not contained in this Statement. When we share your personal information with our Affiliates, they are bound to use that information in accordance with their privacy statement and with regard to their own operations. To view the list of all ACLU Organizations’ privacy statements, read <a href="https://www.aclu.org/about/privacy/aclu-organizations-privacy-statements">ACLU Organizations privacy statements</a>.</p>

					<h3 id="" class="wp-heading-h3 with-standard">Service Providers </h3>
		
			</div>
  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p>We work with a variety of service providers who help us process your personal information as outlined in <a href="#why-we-use-your-information">Why We Use Your Information</a> above, such as to facilitate the operation of our sites; support our fundraising, marketing, communications, and advocacy programs; and deliver messages to you on other platforms.</p>
<p>We require these service providers to agree to take reasonable security measures in the handling and storage of that information. When we share personal information about you with a service provider, we take steps to: (1) transmit it in a secure manner and (2) require the service provider to promise to keep that information confidential and use it only for the purpose of carrying out the activities we have directed them to perform.</p>
<p>We allow some service providers to compile and use certain information related to ACLU and/or its supporters’ use of the services for internal purposes, like improving the functionality or security of the services ACLU receives from the service provider. In some instances, this may include training the service providers’ artificial intelligence tools or features for the services they provide the ACLU*. In addition, we may also permit service providers to create and use data that has been de-identified for broader business purposes, including sharing aggregated benchmarking data with their business partners, other customers, or other third parties. We will not agree to that unless the service provider has sufficiently committed to not recombine the data with other information to identify you, and will not share or sell or use any identifiable data about you for the benefit of third parties outside the ACLU-service provider business relationship.</p>
<p>*ACLU takes your agency over the use of your personal information seriously. As the artificial intelligence landscape continues to evolve, we are committed to monitoring our service providers' artificial intelligence tooling for disproportionate privacy risks and other potential threats to civil liberties</p>

					<h3 id="" class="wp-heading-h3 with-standard">Business Partners  </h3>
		
			</div>
  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p>In some cases, we may disclose personal information to our vendors and other business partners for their own business purposes. In exchange, we may receive money or something else of value to ACLU (e.g., a list of donors or supporters from like-minded organizations whose donors and supporters may also be interested in donating to and supporting ACLU). We may also share your information with third party business partners at your request. For example, we may share information with another nonprofit advocacy organization with whom we are co-hosting an event or working in broader coalition on important civil liberties issues.</p>
<p>These “Business Partners” include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Coalition Partners</b>. To enable more effective advocacy, organizing, and litigation, we often partner with other organizations to further the reach of our work. We may share your personal information with our coalition partners to further those efforts and bolster our respective capacities to pursue our missions. We, however, will only share your personal information if you have requested or consented to have it shared.</li>
<li><b>Co-counsel.</b> As needed, ACLU may share personal information with third parties during litigation, including with co-counsel, referral partners, expert witnesses, and other parties engaged in prospective and pending litigation. Personal Information we share in this context may be related to you or other individuals who are not direct clients depending on the legal matter. For example, we may use modeled voter data that is relevant to a voting rights case against a state government entity. When ACLU lawyers share personal information, particularly client information, they do so in compliance with applicable professional responsibility rules.</li>
<li><b>Data Cooperatives for Nonprofits. </b>To grow our base of donors, ACLU participates in nonprofit data cooperatives. Data cooperatives are membership-based services offered by vendors that enable cooperative members to pool personal information about their respective supporters to model and identify new prospective supporters and/or to deepen engagement with existing supporters. When we participate in data cooperatives, we may share your personal information, including contact and interaction information — for example, donation history — with data-cooperative vendors in exchange for the ability to contact individuals who are prospective ACLU supporters and/or modeled information about existing ACLU supporters who also support other cooperative member nonprofits (e.g., modeled information may include likelihood to become a monthly donor to ACLU). This practice of sharing supporter personal information with and through a data cooperative is a longstanding nonprofit practice that enables nonprofits to maintain a stronger supporter base — while lowering costs — by targeting communications to individuals who are most likely to be interested in hearing from them.ACLU will join a data cooperative only if the cooperative exclusively serves nonprofit entities; does not receive any information from the ACLU about supporters whose information is not already included in the cooperative’s database; does not provide cooperative members direct access to ACLU-provided information; does not share information derived from ACLU-provided information to partisan organizations; will not disclose an individual’s ACLU association to cooperative members; and agrees to remove from the cooperative’s data pool and destroy ACLU-provided information when we leave the data cooperative.</li>
<li><b>Nonpartisan Organizations (List Rental or Exchange). </b>To grow our donor base, ACLU may share your contact information with other nonpartisan organizations, either on a rental basis (i.e., for a monetary fee) and/or in exchange for a similar supporter list from the other nonpartisan organization that ACLU can contact. This information sharing allows each organization to contact the supporters of the other organization to further its mission. This collaboration is critical to maintaining a strong donor base by lowering costs while reaching the widest possible audience. Data shared with nonpartisan organizations is done on a one-time use basis. In order to protect your privacy, list-sharing agreements with other nonpartisan organizations are conducted through secure and confidential arrangements in which the external organization does not directly receive information about you unless you choose to engage. Communications generated from list sharing agreements are carried out by each nonpartisan organization’s service provider(s), e.g., a vendor who prepares and sends out a mailer, who keeps your information confidential and secure. The other organization learns information about your relationship with the ACLU only if you choose to respond to their third-party communication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Third-party Advertisers</b>. ACLU may display targeted advertisements to you on non-ACLU platforms, third-party websites, and social media sites, such as Facebook and Instagram, to fundraise and build support for our advocacy, organizing, and litigation priorities. We target our advertisements to effectively and efficiently reach people who are most likely to take action, including people impacted by government policies. In doing so, we may share your personal information with third-party advertisers to serve targeted advertisements to specific individuals (i.e., one-to-one matching), including you, or to display ads to people who are similar to specific individuals (i.e., “look-alikes”) who have engaged with ACLU. These practices help us engage in effective fundraising and advocacy operations and enable our teams to communicate more effectively with known and prospective supporters. Personal information shared with these third-party advertisers are hashed to improve privacy. Hashing data refers to the practice of scrambling data in a pre-defined manner to make it more difficult to recognize. We only share hashed data with third-party advertisers that promise to hold ACLU-provided information confidentially and securely, and promise not to use ACLU-provided information for other purposes. For additional information on with whom we may have shared your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, please see <a href="https://www.aclu.org/about/privacy/third-party-advertisers">Third-party Advertisers</a>.</li>

					<h3 id="" class="wp-heading-h3 with-standard">Other Third Parties</h3>
		
			</div>
  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p>We may also share certain personal information with other third parties, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocacy Targets. </strong>To enable more effective advocacy, organizing, and litigation, we may use petitions and other message actions to demonstrate our collective size and strength as ACLU advocates and organizers to spur change. When collecting signatures for a petition or facilitating other message actions, we may share personal information with advocacy targets (such as messages to your member of Congress).</li>
<li><strong>Where Requested or Consented to by You (including Public Disclosures) or Necessary to Fulfill Your Request. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Where Required by Law or Necessary to Protect ACLU or Others</strong>. We may disclose personal information from or about you to third parties in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;</li>
<li>To conduct litigation, including by disclosing information to co-counsel or ACLU advisors or other parties involved in the litigation process of claims by or against the ACLU;</li>
<li>In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of ACLU personnel, users of our Digital Services or other ACLU services, our visitors, or the public;</li>
<li>To detect, investigate, prevent or otherwise address fraud or privacy issues;</li>
<li>To operate and maintain the security of our services, including to detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or remediate an attack on our computer systems or networks; or</li>
<li>To protect the rights or property of ourselves, our Affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ACLU considers individual privacy and government overreach to be serious civil liberties issues. If we are required by law or legal process to share your information with government agencies, law enforcement, or other third parties (e.g., plaintiffs or defendants in a legal action), we will object to legal demands for third-party access to your information that we believe to be improper. In those situations, if it is determined that we are required by law to disclose your data, we will attempt to do so under cover of confidentiality and, as long as we are legally permitted to do so, will also attempt to provide you with notice of the request by whatever method is reasonably practical prior to making the disclosure to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will not provide such notice, however, if the disclosure is pursuant to our regular government reporting obligations, such as financial disclosures required for tax law compliance.</p>

					<h3 id="" class="wp-heading-h3 with-standard">Data Choices  </h3>
		
			</div>
  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p><b>Your Data Choices</b></p>
<p>The ACLU offers you several choices in relation to your personal information. These choices may be offered to you as data subject rights required by applicable law. Data subject rights established by law can differ depending on the state or U.S. territory in which you reside and may be subject to legal limitations. The choices that ACLU offers include:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Opting out: </b>You have the choice to opt out of certain types of data processing activities.
<ul>
<li><strong>Targeted Advertising. </strong>You have the choice to opt out of targeted advertising. In the ACLU context, targeted advertising refers to our practice of sharing your personal information with third-party advertisers to direct advertisements to you.</li>
<li><strong>Sales of Data.</strong> You have the choice to opt out of sales of data. In the ACLU context, we exchange donor personal information with other nonpartisan organizations and nonprofit data cooperative vendors. When you opt out of sales of data, you will be removed from both practices.</li>
<li>Note: Some consumer privacy laws also afford residents the right to opt out of profiling or automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant impacts. ACLU does not conduct these activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reviewing and correcting what we have: </strong>You have the choice to review and correct the personal information we have about you, and to review a list of the third parties to whom we may have transferred your personal information. We must consider the interests of others, so this is not an absolute right. If permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. If we determine your request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
<ul>
<li><strong>Request your data report. </strong>You have the choice to request access to your personal information. This includes personal information we have collected and stewarded.</li>
<li><strong>Request your data export. </strong>You have the choice to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly-used, and machine-readable format, and you may have the right to transmit that data to another entity.</li>
<li><strong>Request to correct. </strong>You have the choice to request that we rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you.</li>
<li><strong>Request a third party data transfer report. </strong>You have the choice to request access to a list of third parties — which do not include ACLU Affiliates and service providers — to whom the ACLU has transferred personal information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deleting what we have: </strong>You have the choice to request that we delete the personal information we have about you, except information that is required or permitted to be kept in compliance with applicable law and obligations. If any personal information cannot be deleted, we will notify you when your request is complete.
<ul>
<li>Note: If you choose to delete your personal information from our systems, your membership, donation, advocacy, and volunteer history with the ACLU Organizations will be irreversibly deleted. This will also unsubscribe you from all ACLU Organizations Communications and cancel any recurring donations. You may re-subscribe to ACLU communications at any time, but doing so will not restore your past history with ACLU Organizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Submit a Data Choice Request</b></p>
<p>You may submit a data choice request to us using the mechanisms below. To make submitting Data Choice Requests as easy as possible, we have provided the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recommended: Your Data Choices web form</strong>. We recommend submitting your data choice request(s) via our dynamic <a href="https://action.aclu.org/webform/your-data-choices">Your Data Choices web form</a> to expedite processing.</li>
<li><b>Email.</b> You may also submit an opt-out request for targeted advertising or sales of data by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@aclu.org">privacy@aclu.org</a>.</li>
<li><b>Phone</b>. You may request your data report, request your data export, request to correct, request a data transfer report, or request to delete your data by calling our toll-free number (888) 597-4269. Please be sure to clearly articulate your name, email address, phone number, and request type. If our transcription service has not captured your request accurately, we may need to follow up with you to confirm the request type before we can begin processing your request.</li>
<li><strong>Opt-Out Preference Signals</strong>. The ACLU recognizes and honors opt-out preference signals that meet certain legal requirements, such as the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Privacy Control (GPC)</a>, as a user opt-out request for targeted advertising and sales of data when we can link the opt-out signal to an individual. For example, if you visit our website with GPC enabled and donate, the ACLU can detect and honor your opt-out request for targeted advertising and sales of data alongside your donation. The ACLU does not use information we automatically collect about your browser, device, or interaction with our Digital Services for targeted advertising or sales of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also authorize another party to submit an opt-out request for targeted advertising and/or sales of data or a deletion request on your behalf by having them email <a href="mailto:Privacy@aclu.org">Privacy@aclu.org</a>.</p>
<p>Further notes on making Data Choice Requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Identity Verification.</b> When you or an authorized agent on your behalf make a request, we will confirm your identity. We may contact you for more information to verify your identity beyond what is included in your initial request. Information collected to verify your identity will never be used for any other purpose than to verify your identity to fulfill your request. To preserve privacy and further equity, we are committed to not using biometrics, social security numbers, or commercial credit bureau information as part of our identity verification process.</li>
<li><b>Children. </b>If you are under 13, we do not want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your child’s information removed.</li>
<li><b>Appeals.</b>If you would like to make an appeal related to a Data Choice Request, you may do so by emailing Privacy@aclu.org.</li>

  <div class="wp-text mb-8 is-rich-text">
	  <p>The internet is not a private place.
