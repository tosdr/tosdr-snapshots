        address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender.</p>

        <p><strong>Publisher Partners</strong></p>

        <p>When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf, the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company. This information may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and payment information; information about your background, interests, health, education, career goals, and shopping preferences; and any other information you provide to our website publisher partner.</p>

        <p><strong>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers</strong></p>

        <p>We may automatically receive and store certain types of information about you
        through the data sources listed above.</p>

        <p>You may be familiar with the term &#147;cookies,&#148; which are unique alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your computer. A cookie is placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use cookies for tracking transactions and the user characteristics explained in detail throughout this Privacy Policy. If you choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>

        <p>We may also add third party cookies. Cookies contain anonymous, segmented data
        about a user&#146;s demographics (like age, gender, and location), interests,
        lifestyle, household details, social media memberships, and online influences.
        The data in the cookies may also contain individual-specific information relating to web browsing and app activity.</p>

        <p>We also collect information through our web server applications. This
        information includes your Internet Protocol or &#147;IP&#148; address,
        date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of
        transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those
        transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring
        URL.</p>

        <p><strong>Government Forms</strong></p>

        <p>The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="link3" id="link3">HOW DO WE USE THIS
        INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>

        <p>We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose
        in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.</p>

        <p><strong>Ad Serving</strong></p>

        <p>We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your IP address, the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process, and other socio-economic information, psychographic information, Internet behavior (i.e., browsing, search, shopping, purchase, and ad response behavior), and lifestyle information about you that we obtain from other Company entities and from third parties.</p>

        <p>We also use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our websites. These companies may use and optimize information (not including your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers</strong></p>

        <p>Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on
        the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during
        the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some
        or all of the offers&#146; data fields with the information you submitted during
        the website registration process in order to prevent you from having to re-enter
        this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Upsell</strong></p>

        <p>We utilize customized post transactional or "upsell" technology to help advertisers generate sales, while providing you with a series of great offers we think may be of interest to you. The way it works is simple: once you purchase a product or service from one of our reward advertisers, you will be offered additional products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you elect to purchase products or services from a third party advertiser in the post transactional channel, please input all necessary information on the subsequent advertiser form, including, but not limited to, your credit card information. You need to complete this information because we do not pass this information to the third party advertiser.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer Service and Fulfillment</strong></p>

        <p>We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through Company websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed account status and, where we consider appropriate, investigate your compliance with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. We do retain customer service correspondence.</p>

        <p><strong>Credit Card Preauthorization</strong></p>

        <p>By submitting your credit card information to us or to one of our advertisers, you are authorizing the Company or its agent to periodically verify that your credit card account is valid and has credit available by charging, and thereafter crediting, a small sum to the card.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>

        <p>We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. With respect to telemarketing in particular, you authorize us and our third-party marketing partners to call your landline telephone and/or cell phone (if provided) by providing "prior express consent". You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates may apply to any calls to your cell phone. If you would like to be removed from these programs, <a href="#" onclick="window.open('https://www.Retailer-Savings.com/contact.cgi?config=9597&showme=unsub','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=402'); return false;">click here</a> and follow the opt-out instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>SMS</strong></p>

        <p>SMS, Wireless and Other Mobile Offerings: Some of the services that we provide
        will result in sending an SMS, wireless or other mobile offering to your cell
        phone. These should be obvious in the context of the offering at the time you
        sign up. By signing up, you are agreeing to receive these mobile offerings. You
        understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages.
        To unsubscribe or discontinue SMS messages, send "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS
        text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of
        the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each
        offering. This will not affect offerings sent on behalf of third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>IVR</strong></p>

        <p>Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this website constitutes your
        express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party
        marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice
        dialing. Your consent will be effective regardless of whether the number you have
        provided: (a) is a home, business, or cell phone line; and/or (b) is or will be
        registered on any state or federal Do-Not-Call (DNC) list, and shall remain in
        effect until you revoke your consent by contacting us.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="link4" id="link4">HOW DO WE SHARE
        INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>

        <p>We may share the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose
        in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.</p>

        <p><strong>Within the Company</strong></p>

        <p>We may share information we collect with affiliated companies, including our parent company and other subsidiaries of our parent company, for use in their ad serving and marketing programs. This Privacy Policy does not apply to affiliated companies and their collection, use and sharing of information. With respect to online behavioral advertising, certain affiliated companies may use non-personally identifiable information (which may or may not include click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target=
        "_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Vendors</strong></p>

        <p>We may share your information with various third party vendors that are not part of the Company, including but not limited to vendors that provide us with technology to deploy commercial e-mail, vendors that sell the products or services for which you have qualified through one of our websites, and shipping companies that we utilize to ship products to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Advertisers</strong></p>

        <p>When you participate in an offer by completing a form, we will transfer the information you submitted on the form to the applicable advertiser.</p>

        <p>When you answer &#147;yes&#148; or &#147;no&#148; to a survey question,
        some or all of the information that you submitted during the website registration
        process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be of interest to
        you without providing you with another opportunity to review the information.</p>

<p>If you sign up for email job alerts, we will send you job alerts via email.  You can unsubscribe from these job alerts at any time. We will share your email address and job-related preferences with the vendor that we use to send you email job alerts.</p>

        <p>When you select &#147;yes&#148; next to an offer, we will transfer some or
        all of the information that you submitted during the website registration process
        to the applicable advertiser without providing you with another opportunity to
        review the information.</p>
