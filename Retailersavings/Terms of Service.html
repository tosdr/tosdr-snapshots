        for an offer. We reserve the right to refuse crediting your account for a variety

        have: (1) satisfied all of the requirements stipulated by the advertiser; and (2)

        advertiser offer on your behalf, refund any charges you have incurred or service

        <p><strong>IV.</strong> <strong>REFERRALS</strong></p>

        <p class="t1"><span style="color:black;">A. How it Works</span></p>

        <p class="t2"><span style="color:black;">(1.) As stated above, in order to
        qualify for the reward on this website you must refer</span>
        0 <span style="color:black;">unique household(s) that
        also complete the program requirements.</span></p>

        <p class="t2"><span style="color:black;">(2.) In order to connect these referrals
        to your account, we will provide you with a unique link to this website, which
        you must then distribute to the intended parties. Your referral link will be
        provided on your custom account page. Any referral that does not click this URL
        or type it into their web browser accurately cannot be tracked and thus cannot be
        connected to your account. Note that some applications can remove the tracking
        part of this URL. You assume the risk of this link breaking when using our
        website.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><span style=
        "color:black;">(3.) You are responsible for distributing the referral
        link.</span> USA Interactive, Inc. <span style="color:black;">will not send out any
        communications on your behalf to encourage such sign-ups to occur.</span></p>

        <p class="t2"><span style="color:black;">(4.) You may complete more than the
        required number of reward offers and may refer more than the required number of
        unique households; however, you are limited to earning only one reward per
        household. Additional referrals or offer completions will not result in
        additional rewards.</span></p>

        <p class="t1">B. Referral Fraud</p>

        <p class="t2">(1.) USA Interactive, Inc. reserves the right to screen all referrals for
        suspicious activity. We reserve the right to determine, in our sole discretion,
        which referrals are fraudulent or in violation of these Terms &amp; Conditions,
        and to place on hold or disqualify all accounts associated with an improper
        referral.</p>

        <p class="t2">(2.) Participation in a &#147;conga line&#148; or any other
        organized system of individuals trying to obtain enough referrals to qualify for
        the reward is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification of your
        account, as well as the account belonging to the person(s) that referred you to
        the website and the person(s) that you referred<span style=
        "text-transform:uppercase;">.</span></p>

        <p><strong>V.</strong> <strong>REWARDS</strong></p>

        "window.open('https://www.Retailer-Savings.com/account.cgi?config=9597','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=402'); return false;">Check
        Gift Status</a> and entering the email address that you used to register on the
        website.</p>

        <p class="t2">(2.) Log in to your account when your offer and referral status is
        &#147;Approved,&#148; and a confirmation email will be sent to you with
        instructions for verifying your information. You must follow the instructions in
        the &#147;Approval&#148; email to enter the Redemption Center. In the
        alternative, once your offer and referral status is approved, you can access the
        Redemption Center by logging in to your account and clicking &#147;Click here to
        redeem your gift.&#148;</p>

        <p class="t2">(3.) After verifying your information in the Redemption Center,
        click &#147;Click here to get your gift&#148; to generate a Redemption
        Certificate. Print out this certificate and mail it to the address provided in
        the Redemption Center instructions. Certificates sent to any other address may
        not be processed.</p>

        <p class="t2">(4.) Your Redemption Certificate must be postmarked within 15 days
        of your final required offer being &#147;Approved&#148; or your account will be

        must be received at the mailing address provided in the Redemption Center
        instructions <u>prior</u> to the shipment of the reward. If you fail to return
        the form within 30 days of USA Interactive, Inc.'s request, or if you provide false
        information on the form, your account will be disqualified. To learn more about
        IRS Form W-9, go to http://www.irs.gov.</p>

        <p class="t2">(6.) You must provide a valid current photo ID for USA Interactive, Inc. to redeem your reward.  ID will be used to verify truthful registration.</p>

		<p class="t1">H. <u>Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver</u>.  You and USA Interactive, Inc. each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and USA Interactive, Inc. shall be resolved on an individual basis and resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>

<p class="t2">(1.)	Notice of Dispute.  In the event of a dispute, you or USA Interactive, Inc. must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which shall be a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving such Notice, the facts relied upon for raising the dispute, and the relief requested.  If you are sending a Notice of Dispute to USA Interactive, Inc., you must send such Notice to Attn: Legal Department, 2207 Concord Pike PMB 530, Wilmington, DE 19803.  Any Notice sent by USA Interactive, Inc. will be sent to you by U.S. mail to your address or email address, depending on the contact information we have for you.  You and USA Interactive, Inc. will attempt to resolve any dispute through information negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute was sent.  After 60 days, you or USA Interactive, Inc. may commence arbitration in the manner described below.</p>  

<p class="t2">(2.)	You may also litigate in small claims court in your county of residence or Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court.  You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p>

<p class="t2">(3.)	Class Action Waiver.  YOU AND USA INTERACTIVE, INC. AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  NEITHER YOU NOR USA INTERACTIVE, INC. WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.  NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>

<p class="t2">(4.)	Opt-Out Procedure.  You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (&#147;opt-out&#148;) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (&#147;Opt-Out Notice&#148;).  For new USA Interactive, Inc. users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept the User Agreement for the first time.  If you are already a current USA Interactive, Inc. user and previously accepted the terms &amp; Conditions prior to the introduction of this Agreement to Arbitrate, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the effective date of these Terms &amp; Conditions, which is the date indicated at the end of these Terms &amp; Conditions.  You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Attn: Legal Department, 2207 Concord Pike PMB 530, Wilmington, DE 19803. </p> 

<p class="t2">The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the USA Interactive, Inc. account(s) to which the opt-out applies.  You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.  This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.  If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms &amp; Conditions, including all other provisions of Article VIII will continue to apply and the most recent Sections VIII(G) and VIII(H) before the change you rejected will apply.  Consequently, any dispute will be adjudicated in a state or federal court, as applicable, situated in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction of such courts for that purpose.  Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>

<p class="t2">(5.)	Binding Arbitration and Arbitration Procedures.  If you and USA Interactive, Inc. do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration.  YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.  The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&#147;AAA&#148;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#146;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.  The AAA&#146;s rules are available at http://www.adr.org.  A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#146;s website at http://www.adr.org.  The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or USA Interactive, Inc.., unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  The arbitrator&#146;s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

<p class="t2">(6.)	Costs of Arbitration.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#146;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. </p> 

<p class="t2">(7.)	Severability.  With the exception of any of the terms in subsection VIII(H)(3.) of this Agreement to Arbitrate (Section (H)), if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate (Section VIII(H)) shall still apply.  If a court decides that any of the provisions in subsection VIII(H)(3.) of this Agreement to Arbitrate (Section VIII(H)) are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate (Section VIII(H)) shall be null and void.  In that event, the remainder of the Terms &amp; Conditions, including all other provisions of Article VIII will continue to apply and, any dispute will be adjudicated in a state or federal court, as applicable, situated in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  You hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction of such courts for that purpose. </p>
