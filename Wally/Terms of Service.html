Wally’s failure to insist upon, or enforce, strict performance of any right or provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions shall not constitute or be construed or deemed to be a waiver of such right or provision in the future or a waiver of any other right or provision under these Terms &amp; Conditions. You agree that these Terms &amp; Conditions, Wally’s Privacy Policy and other notices posted through the Services have been drawn up in English. Although translations in other languages of any of the foregoing documents may be available, such translations may not be up to date or complete.

All rights and remedies, whether conferred by this agreement, by any other instrument or by law, shall be cumulative, and may be exercised singly or concurrently.
