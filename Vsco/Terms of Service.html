ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h4><p><strong>Please read the following arbitration agreement (&quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;) carefully. This section provides that you and VSCO agree to resolve all disputes between us through binding arbitration and includes a class action and jury waiver. This agreement supersedes all prior versions.</strong></p><p><strong>Arbitration Notice and Agreement. </strong>This Arbitration Agreement requires you to arbitrate disputes between you and VSCO, which means you will only be able to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis through arbitration. You are also waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial. This Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply even if you delete, or we suspend or terminate, your Account. </p><p><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong>. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of our Services, to any products sold or distributed through our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with us, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you and VSCO can seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents), any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the security of our Services, and/or any illegal or intentional act against your interests or VSCO&#x27;s general business interests. <strong>This Arbitration Agreement applies, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that originated before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement</strong>. You agree to this Arbitration Agreement as a condition of your use (or continued use) of our Services every time it is changed or updated.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) (“<strong>FAA</strong>”), including its procedural provisions, in all respects, applies to the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after complying with the informal dispute resolutions provided above, you must send a Demand for Arbitration, including a copy of these Terms and a description of your dispute to New Era ADR at <a href="https://app.neweraadr.com/">app.neweraadr.com</a>, with copies to (1) VSCO at disputes@vsco.co, and (2) our registered agent at CT Corp, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801. </p><p>The following rules and procedures shall apply to any arbitration proceeding brought under these Terms:</p><ul role="list"><li>Arbitrations will be administrated by New Era ADR in accordance with their Virtual Expedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures as well as any applicable General Rules and Procedures, except as modified by these Terms. New Era ADR&#x27;s Virtual Expedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures and General Rules and Procedures are both available at <a href="http://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures">www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures.</a></li><li>The arbitration will be conducted by a professional arbitrator(s) with substantial experience in resolving commercial disputes. The arbitrator will be selected pursuant to New Era ADR’s standard rank and strike process as described in New Era ADR’s General Rules and Procedures. <br/></li><li>If a claim seeks equitable relief (including injunctive relief), the arbitrator will bifurcate the proceeding and rule on liability first, before conducting any proceedings (including discovery) related to the appropriate relief.</li><li>Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the arbitration proceeding and all records pertaining to it, including but not limited to any documents prepared or produced in connection with the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and/or the arbitration award, will be confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party, except to obtain court confirmation of any arbitration award as needed.</li><li>Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li></ul><p><strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>. If VSCO is initiating an arbitration against you, VSCO will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are initiating an arbitration against VSCO, you will be responsible for the nonrefundable initial filing fee. If, however, the amount of the initial filing fee is more than you would have to pay to file a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (or, for cases where that court would lack original jurisdiction, the California Superior Court, County of San Francisco), VSCO will pay the difference between the initial filing fee and the amount you would have to pay to file a complaint in Court. VSCO will pay both parties’ administrative fee. Otherwise, New Era ADR sets forth fees for its services, which are available at <a href="https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/">https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/</a>. </p><p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong>. The New Era ADR arbitrator(s) assigned to or chosen for your dispute will have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration proceeding will decide each of your and VSCO’s rights and liabilities, if any. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated or joined with any other matters or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions resolving any claim, to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement, including injunctive relief. The arbitrator will issue a written award and decision describing the essential findings and conclusions underlying any award, including the calculation of any damages. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon both you and VSCO.</p><p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>. You and VSCO both waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, with the exceptions stated in this Arbitration Agreement. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and VSCO each waive any right to a jury trial. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court and must follow our Arbitration Agreement as a court would.</p><p><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong>. All disputes, claims, and requests for relief within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class or collective basis. Only individual relief is available. Claims of more than one Creator cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of another Creator.
