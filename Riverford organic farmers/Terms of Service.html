<li id="ordering-and-purchasing">
<h2>Ordering and purchasing</h2>
<ol>
<li>You must be over the age of eighteen to purchase alcohol from Riverford. If you have ordered alcohol from us and cannot be at home to take receipt of your delivery, it is your responsibility to ensure that a suitable person aged eighteen or older is there to receive the order. Anyone who appears to be under the age of 21 may be asked for proof of age and where such proof cannot be provided at the point of delivery Riverford reserves the right to refuse delivery of alcohol. Such refusals will be credited in full, however, we will bear no liability for such refusal.</li>
<li>Orders placed with Riverford may be subject to acceptance based upon a minimum spend, which are published on our website (here). Riverford reserves the right to alter the existing, or introduce new minimum spend conditions which will be published our website.</li>
<li>Any orders you make on the website will be automatically submitted to us at the order cut off times published in the ‘<a href="/about/faqs">frequently asked questions</a>’ on our website (making your account work for you, placing orders). You have the ability to alter, amend and cancel your order up until this cut off time and by allowing an order to be submitted to us you confirm that you have made any such corrections and cancellations and enter into a contract to buy the products from us. You cannot then cancel or withdraw your order, or any part of it except as per 4.10 & 6.3 below.</li>
<li>Where the removal of a product reduces your spend in a particular product category below a given minimum spend threshold (as per 4.2) then we reserve the right not to deliver all products within that product category. Where the minimum order value is not met we reserve the right not to deliver your entire order. Such refusals will be credited in full, however, we will bear no liability for such refusals.</li>
<li>No order placed online is accepted from us until our website displays an order confirmation message. You will receive an ‘order alteration’ email and this email should be kept for reference until your order has been delivered and accepted as correct.</li>
<li>While we will endeavour to deliver all accepted orders, our products are subject to availability and we do not always know if a product is, or will be, available for delivery at the time of accepting an order. If we are unable to deliver an item you have ordered we may offer a reasonable substitute. You may reject this substitute and you will not be charged for it, or where payment has already been taken you will be refunded any amount paid for that item. Where we do not offer a substitute product the item will be removed from your order and again you will not be charged for it, or where payment has already been taken you will be refunded any amount paid for that item. We will bear no liability for the unavailability of our products.</li>
<li>All of the products that we offer are subject to variations in seasonal availability and supply price. Hence, if you set up a regular (repeat) order for a product or products the price of those items will change over time from when you first ordered them. You accept that the price to be paid for all items in your order will be that stated on the website at the time of the order submission as per 4.3.</li>
<li>Where an item has been displayed on our website with an incorrect, erroneous price we reserve the right to remove that item from your order, amend the price to one that is correct or to not deliver the item and refund the price paid.</li>
<li>All prices displayed on the website are inclusive of any applicable taxes and duty (including VAT).</li>
<li>Some of our products are priced by weight (for example, some meat products). We show the prices for weights on the website. The guide weight is for guidance only; the weight you receive may vary from this guide. You will be charged the price for the maximum guide weight and then credited the difference based on the weight of the product that is delivered.</li>
<li>You are entitled to cancel payment for products where there has been fraudulent use of your payment card (despite the above provisions). Where a fraudulent payment has already been made then you should contact your card issuer for credit back to your card.</li>
<li>We only sell to consumers and you must not resell any products ordered from us.</li>
<li>Calls to and from customer services and our payment team will be recorded for training purposes.</li>

<li id="delivery-and-delivery-instructions">
<h2>Delivery and delivery instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>We will deliver to the address stated in your Riverford account (herein also
referred to as “home”).</li>
<li>We reserve the right not to deliver to all locations, or not to deliver all products to all locations. You will be notified during the account creation process if we are unable to deliver to your address. Where we are unable to deliver certain products to your address we will make them unavailable for you to order (both on the website or via the telephone).</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to make suitable arrangements to receive your delivery. The delivery details section of your account is important as it allows you to leave instructions of a suitable location where your delivery can be left if you are not at home to take receipt of the goods, which forms part of our contract under these terms and conditions. It is important that you provide a suitable means (at your own cost) to keep any goods we deliver that need to be refrigerated at a temperature below 8oC until such a time as you are able to refrigerate them.</li>
<li>Once your delivery instructions have been followed and completed by us, you will accept that you are in possession of the delivered goods. Where the delivery instructions have been followed; we will not accept any liability for damage to, or theft of your goods, nor will we accept any liability for any incidents which may arise as a result of the theft or damage to such goods (including alcohol).</li>
<li>In order to maximise efficiency and reduce food miles your order will be delivered on a set day of the week. We will aim to keep this day fixed, however, we reserve the right to change it (either temporarily or permanently) and we will notify you of any such changes.</li>
<li>The time that your order is delivered on that day will vary week on week depending on traffic, weather and the number of deliveries to be made that day. If ordering regularly, you may notice that your delivery occurs at a similar time each week, however, we make no guarantee of this time and accept no liability for inconvenience or loss as a result of a deviation from it.</li>
<li>We cannot accept liability for any inconvenience or loss where we are unable to deliver to you, or deliver to you late, for reasons beyond our control (e.g. adverse weather, vehicle breakdown, traffic congestion, strike actions, supplier failures). We will of course refund you for any part of your order which is not delivered, or which has been compromised as a result of the delay.</li>
<li>To minimise our carbon footprint Riverford reserves the right not to provide a printed receipt with your delivery. Your delivered goods and their value can be viewed online via your Riverford account.</li>
<li>You must inspect your goods as swiftly as possible after delivery and notify us promptly of any errors. We will refund you for any products you receive that were not ordered, are faulty, have been substituted with a product that is unacceptable to you or that were delivered without us following these terms and conditions. However, such liability will be limited to the value of the erroneous and / or undelivered goods.</li>
<li>
<p>Where we agree to hold keys to your delivery address in order to gain access and comply with your delivery instructions (as per 2.3) the following terms will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will use reasonable endeavour to ensure the keys are held securely.</li>
<li>We shall not be liable for any losses, damage or costs arising from us holding and using your keys, except where such losses, damages and costs have arisen from our negligence in holding your keys.</li>

<li id="cancellation">
<h2>Cancellation</h2>
<ol>

<li>Riverford may cancel your account and or any accepted orders at our reasonable discretion or if you breach any of your obligations under these terms and conditions.</li>

This can be done by notifying us by telephone, email or post. We may request the return or collection of these goods and refund you the price paid for them less our reasonable costs in collecting the goods.</li>
<li>
<p>You can cancel your order either online or by phone or email. Cancellations made online by 11.45pm, or by 5pm by phone or email, two days before your delivery are free. In exceptional circumstances and at our discretion, we can cancel orders until 1pm the day before your delivery but will charge a one-off sum. This is to go towards the cost of preparing your order at the farm, which happens on the day before delivery. Charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>£5 for orders up to £25 in value</li>
<li>£10 for orders £25-100 in value</li>

<li>Once the referred friend has received their first order, £15 credit will automatically be added to the account balances of both the referrer and the referred friend, and a donation will be made to Riverford's FareShare fund.</li>
<li>There is no restriction on the number of referrals a customer can make. However, the maximum amount of credit anyone can receive is £150 every 28 days.</li>
<li>Credit is non-redeemable and cannot be transferred between accounts.</li>
<li>We can’t award credit unless the referred friend has signed up via a valid referral link (unique to each customer’s Your Account page).</li>
<li>Riverford reserve the right to remove or withhold credit if the spirit of the programme is being abused.</li>
<li>Riverford reserve the right to withdraw this promotion without any prior notice, and to vary elements of the offer at any time without notice.</li>

<h2>Gift vouchers</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Gift vouchers issued by Riverford Organic Farmers have an expiration period of 5 years from the date of purchase.
</li>
<li>
Gift vouchers can be purchased in denominations of £15, £25, and £50 and will be delivered electronically to the
registered email on the purchaser’s account.
</li>
<li>
To redeem a gift voucher, the customer must have an account with Riverford, either signing in to an existing account or
creating a new account.
</li>
<li>
Upon redemption, the value of the voucher will be added as credit to the customer's account and will automatically apply
to the cost of any future order. Unspent credit will remain in the customer’s account to be used on future purchases
until the full balance is redeemed.
</li>
<li>
Gift vouchers may be used to purchase any item on the Riverford website, with the exception of further gift vouchers.
They are not valid for purchases at The Riverford Field Kitchen or Ben’s Farm Shops.
</li>
<li>
Gift vouchers are non-refundable. Once purchased, the value cannot be redeemed for cash or refunded.
</li>
<li>
When a gift voucher is purchased, it may be transferred to any other person; however, once it is redeemed as credit on
an account, it is no longer transferable.
</li>
<li>
A customer can apply multiple vouchers to a single account, and they may be used in a single purchase. There is no limit
to the number of vouchers that can be used together.
</li>
<li>
Customers should contact customer service if their voucher is lost. We will make best efforts to assist customers in
such situations; however, we cannot guarantee reclamation of the voucher value.
</li>
<li>
By purchasing and redeeming a gift voucher at Riverford Organic Farmers, customers acknowledge and accept these terms
and conditions.
</li>
<li>
Riverford reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or cancel orders if we suspect abuse of the gift
vouchers and their redemption.
