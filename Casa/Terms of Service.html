If you do not have an Account on the Services and purchase Products, we either use the Payment Processor to bill you through a payment method accepted by the Payment Processor at the time of your purchase or bill you directly using BTCPay, again depending on your chosen payment method. You acknowledge that your payments will be subject to the terms and conditions (including without limitation exchange and conversion rates) and privacy policies of the financial institution, credit card or debit card issuer, Exchange, or other provider of your chosen payment method, as applicable, in addition to these Terms of Service.

You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. <br/></li><li class="list-item-33"><strong class="tos-bold-item">Payment Method.</strong> The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, Exchange or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.<br/></li><li class="list-item-33"><strong class="tos-bold-item">Recurring Billing</strong>.

WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY OR YEARLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.

Your non-termination or continued use of a Membership, or other Paid Service that is offered on a subscription basis, reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.<br/></li><li class="list-item-33"><strong class="tos-bold-item">Free Trials and Other Promotions</strong>.
