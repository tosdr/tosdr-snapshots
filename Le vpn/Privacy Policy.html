When registering, Clients shall not use any methods to bypass our security filters or risk estimation mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We may suspend or close the account you have with us and block your use of our Le VPN Service and Site, if (in our opinion) you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who use your account with us are aware of these Terms of Use, and that they comply with them. You are responsible for all use of your security details and your account. You must treat your username and password, and any other security details, as confidential, and not disclose them to any other person. You must also prevent unauthorised access to your account.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>2. Subscription Plans</strong> <strong>&amp; Payment Terms</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our Le VPN Service is available on subscription plans of various durations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You may download our Software to an unlimited number of devices; however, each subscription only entitles you to the number of simultaneous connections as allowed by us in your subscription. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your subscription is for your own personal use only and you may not rent, lend, hire out or otherwise share your connection with another person.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The plans we offer, and the prices, are as shown on our Site. You can select the subscription plan that best suits your needs. We can change our prices at any time, but changes will not affect any subscription that you have already paid for.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All fees are charged and payable in full in advance unless we agree otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You must pay us in one of the currencies stated on our Site. Payment can be made by debit or credit cards, by Bitcoin or through one of the payment methods, shown on our Site. If you setup a recurring payment, you authorise us to take payment in this way on an ongoing basis using the payment details you provide until you tell us to change your method of payment. If you wish to change your method or payment, or change your payment details, please tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to implement the change before subscription expires. If we are unable to take a recurring payment, your subscription will not be renewed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you purchase a subscription to our Le VPN Service via one of our authorised resellers, your agreement is with the reseller you have used, but you shall expressly accept our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy which will thus apply to you as if you were our direct customer as we are the supplier of the Le VPN Service.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We do not provide our Le VPN Service to clients residing in Hong Kong and do not accept payments from Hong Kong credit cards, Hong Kong Paypal accounts or any other means of payment coming from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>3. Refunds</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clients are eligible for refund only for 30 days as of the date of first activation (which excludes any refund in case of renewals or new accounts if the user has already tried our Le VPN Service) of the Le VPN Service. Indeed, we offer a 30-day money back guarantee for new subscriptions, except for subscriptions purchased by mobile payment methods (for instance through App Store or iTunes) or by other alternative payment methods (for instance Qiwi, CashU, Openbucks, and other cash-based and alternative payment methods) which cannot be refunded (Refunds of iOS or iTunes in-app purchases (if user subscribes to the Le VPN Service from our app) should be processed directly with App Store or iTunes). If we cancel or suspend your account with us due to a breach by you of these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy we will not refund any fees to you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All refund requests are processed by our support team during the standard working hours from Monday to Friday, and the delay of the refund processing depends on the payment method used by each user and does not depend on LE VPN. Any refund request initiated through PayPal or any other payment dispute/claim system will lead to immediate account termination without a refund.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund. We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your subscription.</span></p>
