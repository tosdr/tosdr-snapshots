You are not required to create an account to make a request; more information on each of these rights is set out below. </li><li>Authorized Agent. If you are an agent submitting a request on a consumer’s behalf, please have them<strong> </strong>complete, date, and sign the Verification of Identity and Designation of Authorized Agent form at <a href="https://cdn.cameo.com/static/legal/Cameo+-+Verification+of+Identity+and+Designation+of+Authorized+Agent.pdf">this link</a> and send a copy, by email to <a href="mailto:dataprotection@cameo.com">dataprotection@cameo.com</a>. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm to us that they gave you permission to submit the request.
