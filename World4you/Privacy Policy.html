<h4 id="H2.2.Legalbasisfortheprocessingofpersonaldata" class="wikigeneratedid">
<span>
<strong>2.2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>
</span>
</h4>
<p>Insofar as we obtain consent from the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 Para. 1 Item a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.</p>

<p>The following data is collected in doing so:</p>
<p>(1) Information on the browser type and the version used<br />(2) The user’s operating system<br />(3) The user’s internet service provider<br />(4) The user’s IP address<br />(5) Date and time of access<br />(6) Websites from which the user’s system accesses our website<br />(7) Subpages and functions that the user calls up<br />(8) Websites that are called up by the user’s system from our website</p>
<p>This data is also stored in our system’s log files. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.</p>
<h4 id="H3.2.Legalbasisforthedataprocessing" class="wikigeneratedid">
<span>
<strong>3.2. Legal basis for the data processing</strong>
</span>
</h4>
<p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and log files is Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR.</p>
<h4 id="H3.3.Purposeofthedataprocessing" class="wikigeneratedid">
<span>
<strong>3.3. Purpose of the data processing</strong>
</span>
</h4>
<p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to enable the provision of the website to the user’s computer. To this end, the IP address of the user must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>
<p>The storage and analysis in log files takes place so as to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, this data helps us to optimise the website and ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>
<p>These purposes also form the basis of our legitimate interest in the data processing according to Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR.</p>
<h4 id="H3.4.Durationofthestorage" class="wikigeneratedid">
<span>
<strong>3.4. Duration of the storage</strong>
</span>
</h4>
<p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the achievement of the purpose for which it was collected. In the event that the data is recorded for the provision of the website, this is the case once the respective session is ended. In the event that the data is stored in log files, this is the case at the latest after fourteen days. Storage beyond this point is not possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or distorted such that association with the inquiring client is no longer possible.</p>

</h4>
<p>The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Consequently, the user has no option to object.</p>
<p>There is an option to object with regard to the evaluation of the subpages and functions that the user calls up in the customer area, webmail or PHPMyAdmin tool, for the purpose of optimising the website (improvement of usability). A settings option in the customer area enables you to declare your objection in this respect:</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, from which website users are usually not affected, Wordfence uses cookies. Below, we explain what each cookie does, which users the cookie is set for and how the cookie helps protect the site.</p>
<p>(1) wfwaf-authcookie- (Hash): This cookie is used by the Wordfence firewall to carry out a capability check on the current user before WordPress loads. It’s only set for users who can log into WordPress. The Wordfence firewall uses this cookie to recognise logged-in users and allow them increased access. Wordfence can also detect users who are not logged in and restrict their access to secure areas. The cookie informs the firewall what level of access a visitor has, so that the firewall can make informed decisions about who should be allowed and who should be blocked.</p>
<p>(2) wf_loginalerted_ (Hash): This cookie is used to notify the Wordfence administrator when an administrator logs in from a new device or location. This cookie is set for administrators only and is used to help site operators know if an admin has logged in from a new device or location.</p>
<p>(3) wfCBLBypass: Wordfence offers a site visitor the option of bypassing country blocking by accessing a hidden URL. This cookie can be used to track who can bypass country blocking. When a hidden URL defined by the site administrator is accessed, this cookie is used to check whether the user can access the site from a country restricted by country blocking. This is set for anyone who knows the URL that enables the default country blocking to be bypassed. This cookie is not set for anyone who does not know the hidden URL to bypass country blocking. This cookie gives site owners the ability to allow certain users of blocked countries even though their country has been blocked.</p>

We would like to point out that we have no influence on the scope of the transmitted data and its further use by Reddit and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of Reddit conversion pixels, Reddit receives the information that you have called up the corresponding web page of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Reddit service, Reddit can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Reddit or have not logged in, it is possible that the provider will find out and store your IP address and other identifying features.</p>
<p>The processing of your data is based on your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future. </p>

<strong>17. TikTok Pixel</strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>On our website, we use the so-called TikTok pixel of the social network TikTok, which is operated by TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland (&#34;TikTok&#34;). The parent company of TikTok is based in China.</p>
<p>
<strong>ATTENTION: Within the scope of this service, data transfer to China takes place or cannot be ruled out.</strong>
</p>
<p>With the help of the TikTok pixel, it is possible for TikTok, on the one hand, to determine you as a visitor to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called &#34;TikTok ads&#34;). Accordingly, we use the TikTok pixel to display the TikTok ads placed by us only to those TikTok users who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of the websites visited) that we transmit to TikTok (so-called &#34;Custom Audiences&#34;).</p>
<p>With the help of the TikTok pixel, we also want to ensure that our TikTok ads correspond to the potential interest of users and are not harassing. The TikTok pixel also allows us to track the effectiveness of the TikTok ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a TikTok ad (so-called &#34;conversion&#34;).</p>
<p>The processing of the data by TikTok takes place within the framework of the data use policy at <span class="wikiexternallink">

<p>The use of the TikTok pixel as well as the storage of &#34;conversion cookies&#34; is based on your consent according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time.</p>
<p>For the processing of data for which TikTok acts as a data processor, we have concluded a data processing agreement with TikTok in which we oblige TikTok to protect our customers&#039; data and not to pass it on to third parties.</p>
