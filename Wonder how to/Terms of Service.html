                    that sends more request messages to the WonderHowTo servers in a given period of

                    purposes (other than any revenue sharing or similar opportunities we may offer from

                    The provisions of Sections 3A, 4C, 4D, 4E, 5 - 11, and 13 – 17 shall survive any

                </p>

                <h3>17. Assignment</h3>

                <p class="mgb mgt-smaller">
                    This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, shall not be transferred
                    or assigned by you, but may be assigned by WonderHowTo without restriction.
                </p>

                <h3>18. General</h3>

                <p class="mgb mgt-smaller">
                    A. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in
                    California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive that does not give rise
                    to personal jurisdiction over WonderHowTo, either specific or general, in jurisdictions
                    other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
                    of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or
                    dispute between you and WonderHowTo that arises in whole or in part from the Service
                    shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Los
                    Angeles County, California.
                </p>

                <p class="mgb mgt-smaller">
                    B. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement as updated, together with any other
                    agreements you enter into in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire
                    agreement between you and WonderHowTo concerning the Service. If any provision of
                    this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
                    of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
                    Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <p class="mgb mgt-smaller">
                    C. No agency, joint venture, partnership or employment relationship is created as
                    a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority to bind WonderHowTo
                    in any way. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or
                    continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and WonderHowTo's failure to assert
                    any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision. WonderHowTo reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any
                    time and without notice effective upon posting of any amendments on the Service,
                    and it is your responsibility to review this Agreement for any changes, provided
                    that if in our sole discretion the revision is material, we will post such amendments
                    at least seven days before they become effective. Your use of the Service following
                    any amendment of this Agreement will signify your assent to and acceptance of its
                    revised terms and conditions.
                </p>
