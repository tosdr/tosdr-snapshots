        display some of your information. We collect the following types of information from our
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information You Provide to Us:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as images
        of written homework questions and queries submitted to the Services. All content submitted
        by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely unless you request that we delete
        it. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties as described in this Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We automatically receive and record information from you when you interact with the
        Services, including your IP address, device installation ID, cookie information, and what
        actions you take in the Services. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and
        also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g.,
        what links you have clicked on). This information is not made public. However, we do at
        times share this information, including your Personal Information, with our partners,
        affiliates, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business to process
        this information on our behalf and at our instruction, and as otherwise specified below in
        this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and
        frequency of visitors to the Services as well as location (at the city and state level). We
        may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information Collected Using Cookies:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser
        when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each
        website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and
        tell us how and when you visit the Services and otherwise use the Services through the
        Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the
        general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who
        you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed
        aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your
        browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
        browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of
        ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take
        advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by
        third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer.
        For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Legacy Socratic Website:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Website previously permitted the creation of user accounts tied to a user’s email
        address and the public exchange of content among users on the Website. For example, a user
        could post a homework question and other users would provide an answer. While the Website no
        longer has logged in functionality, if you previously used the Services through a username,
        we may continue to display your public-facing user profile and posts on the Website unless
        you ask us to delete it. We also store the email address you provided for your account for
        purposes of responding to any questions or concerns you might have regarding the activity
        under your username. Additionally, you may occasionally receive email and other
        communications from us for purposes important to the Services. We will not directly reveal
        user email addresses to other users.

      </p>
      <p>
        You may share your information with third parties by accessing Third Party Services through
        the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the
        Site or Applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of
        these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those
        Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information
        collected by us or our Agents on the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you previously used the Services through a logged-in account, you may have shared
        information, including Personal Information, publicly by posting on the Site or using other
        public features of the Services, such as creating a user account profile. Individuals
        reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our
        control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. If you
        have any questions or concerns regarding information you may deem private in content that
        you posted through the Services please contact us at <a
          href="mailto:socratic-feedback@google.com">socratic-feedback@google.com</a>.

      <p>
        <i>Information We Share with Third Parties:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our
        behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may share your information,
        including your Personal Information, with our Agents in order to provide products or
        services to you, including the Services. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not
        have any right to use your Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary
        to assist us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also share aggregated information and other de-identified information with our partners,
        affiliates, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. In addition,
        these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal
        Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user
        information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or
        substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter
        bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
        third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or
        our assets may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy, including for
        the improvement and development of their services and products.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we
        reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process
        or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Service, which includes this Privacy
        Policy, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or
        otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support
        requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
        includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
        and spam/malware prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Additional Information Sharing:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared
        with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

      <p>
