You acknowledge and agree that AlzForum has the right to share User Content with third party developers and licensees using the application programming interface (API) provided and licensed in connection with the Platform, however, that this will only occur if you authorize access to any of User Content by any other licensees or other users of the Platform.

		&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p class="centered">Attention: Privacy &amp; Security</p>
<p class="centered">AlzForum Foundation Inc.<br />

<p>Please note that Section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act may impose liability for damages on any person who knowingly sends meritless notices of infringement. Please do not make false claims. Any information or correspondence that you provide may be shared with third parties, including the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.

<ul>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work that was removed, and the location on the Platform where it would have been found prior to its removal;<br />
