  <h2>SoftCafe iMenuPro</h2>
  <p>Last updated August 4, 2024</p>
  <h3>Terms of Service</h3>

     
  <h4>General</h4>
  <p>Please read this entire page carefully, as signing up for (subscribing) and using iMenuPro means accepting these terms. If you do not consent to these terms, you cannot use iMenuPro. These terms may have changed since your last visit to this website and/or your last use of iMenuPro. By using iMenuPro you indicate acceptance of any updates to these terms and conditions.</p>
  

  <p>iMenuPro, a service of SoftCafe, LLC is provided to you at a recurring fee of either $16/month or $129/year, both in US dollars. We expect this product and the services offered by this product will change over time. In particular, we will make feature changes and/or add advanced or premium user services or add-ons that may only be available for additional one-time or recurring fees on an opt-in basis. Your right to use this product is limited in scope, revocable, personal, non-transferable except as expressly permitted by the service through its account transfer policy, and non-exclusive</p>


  <h4>Breach of Terms</h4>
  <p>If you violate any of these terms your account will be terminated.  We may immediately deactivate your account and prevent access to all of your data without prior notice or liability to you.</p>
  

  <h4>Signup, Privacy, and Registration Data Rights</h4>
  <p>To access iMenuPro you will be required to sign up for an account and provide a password to secure the account.  For payment, you must provide a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the sign up process including the full legal name of the credit card holder. SoftCafe does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal signup data or any other personally identifiable information or data, with the exception of when we believe the release is necessary to comply with the law. We may occasionally contact you via email with product updates that we feel will improve your experience with iMenuPro. These emails will always include a prominent, and effective, unsubscribe link.</p>

  <h4>Credit Card Information</h4>
  <p>No one at SoftCafe can see the credit card information associated with your account. We use Stripe for payment processing. Stripe encrypts your credit card information in their database and is PCI and GDPR compliant, so you can feel good about how they secure your information. Stripe provides to us the last 4 digits of your credit card only so you can later identify which credit card you are using within our service.</p>

  <h4>Security and Password</h2>
  <p>SoftCafe encrypts your password in our database for security. It is your sole responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password and account. If you forget your password we will send a secure link to your email address so you can reset it.</p>


  <h4>Account Ownership and Responsibility</h4>
  <p>The individual who signs up for an account with their email address (the 'Account Holder') is considered the owner of the account. The Account Holder is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials and for all activities that occur under their account. While payment information may be provided by a different individual, such provision does not confer account ownership rights. The Account Holder retains full control over the account, including the ability to manage the subscription, change settings, and close the account.</p>

  <h4>Account Transfer Policy</h4>
  <p>You may transfer your account to another individual, while your account is active, by changing the email address associated with the account and updating the payment information to reflect the new subscriber. The new account holder must accept the terms of service as well. Please note that the original Account Holder remains responsible for any activity on the account until the transfer is fully completed and confirmed by SoftCafe via confirmation emails.

  <h4>Data Content Usage and Ownership</h4>
  <p>While you are an active subscriber to iMenuPro, you have the right to input, use, and access your data, including menus and other content you create (collectively, 'User Content'). By entering User Content into iMenuPro, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to display, host, copy, store, and use your User Content solely to the extent necessary to provide the iMenuPro service to you. To the extent you include User Content that is published, such as a printed or online menu or other design, that is shared with others, you grant SoftCafe a perpetual, royalty-free, license to display, host, copy, store and use your User Content to the extent necessary to continue to make that menu or other design available. If your subscription is canceled for any reason, you acknowledge and agree that all rights to access, use, or retain User Content within the iMenuPro service are forfeited. Additionally, upon cancellation or expiration of your subscription, you forfeit any ownership rights to User Content within iMenuPro's ecosystem. We may delete your User Content from our servers without liability if the terms of this agreement are violated or other unforeseen reasons. We strongly recommend exporting your User Content before cancellation if you wish to retain it, and after exporting it we recommend that you delete it from the iMenuPro service if you wish to permanently remove it from our servers.</p>


  <h4>Your Content and Code of Conduct</h4>
  <p>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. This means that you need to ensure that all of the content posted using iMenuPro complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including (but not limited to) U.S. copyright law. SoftCafe does not pre-screen content to ensure compliance, but we do have the right (but not the obligation) to refuse or remove any content that is available via the iMenuPro service, at our sole discretion.</p>

  <p>If you upload images or fonts to be used with the iMenuPro service, you must either own the font(s) or image(s) or have the rights to use them for your intended purpose.</p>

  <p>You may not impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, or make available any material that contains software viruses, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware equipment or interfere with or disrupt the iMenuPro service.</p>

  <p>You may not redistribute or post any graphic image from this site or service on any electronic bulletin board, put these images in a down-loadable or retrievable format, or resell these images. Using a graphic image from this site in such a manner is a violation of Federal copyright law.</p>


  <h4>Subscription Service</h4>
  <p>You will receive access to iMenuPro on a monthly or yearly subscription fee basis. The term will renew automatically and continuously until canceled. SoftCafe reserves the right to raise or lower the price of the iMenuPro service at any time. However, changes to pricing will not apply to you until (90) days after notice. We may also offer you the option to continue using the service on legacy pricing. For new subscribers, we may also offer a 14-day free trial period at our discretion. Following the trial period, if you have not canceled the service, you will automatically be charged the normal monthly or yearly subscription fee and will receive access to iMenuPro on a monthly or yearly subscription basis. You agree that SoftCafe may contact you at any time by email, or other method with information relevant to your subscription, billing, and use of the Service.</p>

  
  <h4>Sales Tax Collection</h4>
  <p>In accordance with applicable state and local laws, we collect sales tax in US jurisdictions where we have an obligation to do so. The tax rate applied will be the combined state and local rate for the address information you provide when entering your credit card details. Sales tax is calculated based on the total subscription fees and one-time fees for additional opt-in, add-on products, as required by law. The sales tax amount displayed during the signup process or add-on purchase process is an estimate and may differ from the final amount charged. If you have questions about the sales tax on your invoice, please contact customer support.</p>

 
 <h4>Currency Conversion</h4>
  <p>You will be charged in US currency. If your bank is not in the United States, it may then add up to two types of additional charges:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A conversion fee to exchange the payment from US currency to your local currency.</li>
      <li>A “foreign transaction” fee because your bank is located in a country other than where SoftCafe is located.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>This is up to your bank, so the exact behavior might vary.</p>
  <p>Subscription fees and one-time fees for additional opt-in, add-on products are listed in the United States Dollar. Any other currency rates that may be displayed are for information purposes only and are subject to change without notice. SoftCafe cannot guarantee the accuracy of other currency rates displayed.</p>

 
   <h4>Free Demo</h4>
   <p>Access to an iMenuPro demo, that you may freely use without signing up for the iMenuPro service, may be available from this website at no charge. But since the demo does not collect signup or payment information, we cannot guarantee under all circumstances that data entered or menus created during use of the demo will be transferred to your account if you sign up for the iMenuPro service. In most cases however, if you sign up for the iMenuPro service directly from the demo page, your data entered and menu created during use of the demo will be transferred to your account at signup.</p>

  
  <h4>Warranties and Disclaimers</h4>
  <p>The iMenuPro service is provided by SoftCafe, LLC on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee and are not liable for any failure to access or store your data on iMenuPro at any time. Like all cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.<p>

  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, we make no warranty that:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The service will meet your specific requirements</li>
    <li>The service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free, or data-loss free</li>
    <li>The results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be effective, accurate, or reliable</li>
    <li>The quality of the service or materials purchased by you will meet your expectations or be free from mistakes, errors, or defects</li>
    <li>The menus created with iMenuPro will be 100% screen readable, UA compliant, or fully compliant with any other accessibility compliance format</li>
    <li>Any errors or defects in the service will be corrected</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The iMenuPro service could include technical or other mistakes, inaccuracies, or typographical errors. We may make changes to the materials and services, at any time without notice. The iMenuPro service and SoftCafe materials may be out of date, and we make no commitment to update such materials or services.</p>

  </p>The use of the iMenuPro service, SoftCafe materials, or any other materials through this site is done at your own discretion and risk and you agree that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from such activities.</p>

  <p>Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

  
  <h4>Cancellation and Termination</h4>
  <p>You are solely responsible for canceling your subscription. An email or phone request to cancel your subscription is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your subscription at any time by logging in and clicking on Your Account at the top-right of the screen. Once in your Account Settings, click the Cancel Subscription link and follow the instructions.</p>

  <p>Additionally, if your payment method is declined over several days of repeated attempts, your subscription will be automatically canceled.</p>

  <p>Once your subscription is canceled, you will no longer be able to log in to the iMenuPro service and you will lose access rights within iMenuPro to your User Content including published menus or designs, such as QR menus, which may become automatically unpublished. Your personal signup data will be retained within iMenuPro with the intent of enabling you to reinstate your subscription to access your prior user content, if it still exists, at a later date. If you wish to forgo this option and want to have your personal data permanently removed from our database, you should notify us at our <a href="https://imenupro.com/company.htm">company contact page</a> and request that we do so.</p>
  
  <p>If you reinstate your subscription by re-subscribing with the same personal signup information (email address and password), your prior menu content data will be accessible, unless it was removed due to violations of these terms or other reasons.</p>

  <p>If you cancel before the end of your current paid up billing period (month or year), you are charged for the current billing period (month or year), but you will not be charged again.</p>
  
  <p>SoftCafe may, at our sole discretion, terminate or suspend your access to all or part of iMenuPro without prior notice or liability to you.</p>


  <h4>Refunds</h4>
  <p>Since we offer a free demo, SoftCafe does not offer refunds for the iMenuPro service, including refunds for partially used terms. If not satisfied for any reason, you may cancel your subscription to avoid charges for the next billing period (month or year).</p>


  <h4>Term</h4>
  <p>This Agreement shall commence on the date you first use the iMenuPro service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SoftCafe may stop, temporarily or permanently, providing the iMenuPro service or any features within iMenuPro, to you or users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We retain the right to create limits on access and expiry of our service at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice.</p>


  <h4>Children and Minors</h4>
  <p>The iMenuPro service is not intended for use by minors under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit any information from such minors. If you are a parent or legal guardian who discovers that your child has provided us with information without your consent, you may notify us at our <a href="https://imenupro.com/company.htm">company contact page</a> and request that we permanently remove such information from our database.</p>


  <h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

  <p>The iMenuPro service is controlled by us from our offices within the state of Maryland, United States of America. It can be accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the world. As each of these places has laws that may differ from those of Maryland, by accessing iMenuPro you agree that all matters related to the use of iMenuPro shall be governed by the statutes and laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.</p>

  <p>You also agree and hereby submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue any court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Maryland with respect to such matters.</p>


  <h4>International Users</h4>
  <p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the iMenuPro service is hosted in the United States. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in the United States. As a result, United States federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the United States. Your use of this service or your submission of any personal information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your home country, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.</p>


  <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

  <p>These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and SoftCafe with respect to your access and use of iMenuPro, superseding any prior agreements between us (including any prior versions of these terms). The failure of SoftCafe to enforce or exercise any right or provision of these terms of service shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.<p>
