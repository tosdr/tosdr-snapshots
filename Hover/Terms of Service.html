			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			<p>This is an Agreement between You and Tucows.com Co. ("Tucows"), the company that provides domain registration and other services via the website at <a href="https://www.hover.com/">https://www.hover.com</a>. We've tried really hard to keep this Agreement as readable and straightforward as possible. If you have suggestions that can help us improve it, please let us know.</p>
			<p>Hover is a service provided by Tucows.</p>
			<p>You are our valued customer. We expect you to be of sufficient legal age to be able to enter into binding contracts and provide consent to the collection and processing of any personal data we need to provide services to you.</p>
			<p>This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us. Combined with the Third-Party Terms identified below, this Agreement is the entire Agreement between us.</p>

			<h2 id="general_terms">General Terms</h2>
			<p>Tucows will update this Agreement from time to time, usually to reflect new obligations and policies arising from the introduction of new services. It might also be updated to modify or clarify existing obligations and policies.</p>
			<p>You should visit this page from time to time to review any changes. We may notify you if this Agreement changes, or we may not. Any notification of any changes would be purely a courtesy and is not required by this Agreement.</p>

			<h2 id="hover_privacy_policy">Hover Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Your agreement with us concerning the treatment of information we collect about you under this Agreement is detailed in the terms of <a href="https://www.hover.com/privacy">our Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="email_acceptable_use_policy">Email Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
			<p>If you use our email services, you agree to abide by our <a href="https://www.hover.com/aup">Email Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="term_of_agreement_and_renewals">Term of Agreement and Renewals</h2>
			<p>The Term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months. When you renew your services with us, this Agreement will be renewed for additional 12 month periods, coincident with the term of your services.</p>
			<p>On the day prior to the renewal date of your domain name or email services (or both), we will attempt to renew your services for an additional year. If our renewal is successful, this Agreement will be extended for an additional 12 months.</p>
			<p>Note that the renewal date of some domains (including, but not necessarily limited to: .ac, .co.nz, .org.nz, .net.nz, .sh, .at, .io, .la, .gd) may be different than the expiry date shown due to the specific policies of the various domain name registries.</p>
			<p>If you do not wish to continue service for a domain name or email address beyond its current period, you should disable the automatic renewal of those services. <a href="https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/222421328">Click here for easy instructions</a> for disabling autorenewal for a domain name or email service.</p>
			<p>Renewal fees and Premium Domain purchases are non-refundable.</p>
			<p>ICANN requires that we send notices, via email, about 30 days prior to expiry, and again within about seven days prior to expiry. An additional email must be sent within seven days after expiry of the domain (if applicable). The terms of our Registrar Agreement with ICANN dictate that we are required to send these emails to you, regardless of whether you wish to receive them or not.</p>
			<p>Hover also sends additional reminders about your domains and services that you can opt in or out of receiving. You can choose how often to receive these emails at <a href="https://www.hover.com/settings">https://www.hover.com/settings</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="billing_contact_information">Billing & Contact Information</h2>
			<p>Hover bills for services in USD. All prices listed on our site are shown in USD.</p>
			<p>Hover accepts a variety of payment methods, including all major credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and account funding.</p>
			<p>You may pre-fund your account (minimum of $10, maximum of $2500) using any accepted payment method. We may hold funds for up to 72 hours to review for fraud. We will draw from the pre-funded balance before using your stored payment method for any excess not covered by the current fund balance. There are no fees for depositing or using your funded amount and the funded amount will not bear interest.</p>
			<p>If your billing information is not current and, we cannot renew your services, and this Agreement will terminate on the last day of the then current term.</p>
			<p>Your right to use your domain name also allows you to transfer your domain name to someone else or hold the registration in the name of a third party.</p>
			<p>Tucows needs to be able to contact you easily and quickly. You are responsible for ensuring that Tucows has accurate and current contact and billing information for you, including your complete real name, an accurate postal address, an accurate and checked email address, and at least one voice telephone number; you may also provide us with an accurate facsimile telephone number. You also must provide accurate and current contact information for all contacts in each field of your domain name registration record.</p>

			<h2 id="timely_payment">Timely Payment</h2>
			<p>Your right to use your domain name is for a finite period of time, measured by the term of your registration. If you do not pay your fees within thirty (30) days of the due date, we will close your account and terminate this Agreement.</p>
			<p>If your account is closed for non-payment, any right to any domain name previously in your account will transfer to Tucows and a cancellation surcharge of $175 per domain name cancelled plus applicable renewal fees may be levied on your account.</p>
			<p>You agree that Tucows may charge the credit card you have on file with Hover to recover any amounts outstanding on your account.</p>

			<h2 id="recovering_a_domain_name_after_expiry">Recovering a Domain Name After Expiry</h2>
			<p>It may be possible to recover a domain name after it has expired. Renewal of a domain name after its expiration is subject to a Redemption Recovery fee of $175 plus any applicable renewal fees and taxes. It may not always be possible to renew a domain name after it has expired and Tucows has the sole and final word in determining when a domain name can be renewed post-expiration and what fees will be applicable.</p>
			<p>If you fail to pay for a domain name, it is forfeit and Tucows will have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) register and use the domain name for its own purposes; (b) sell or transfer the domain name to a third-party; or (c) delete the domain name and allow any new registrant anywhere in the world to register the domain name.</p>

			<h2 id="cancelling_termination">Cancelling & Termination</h2>	
			<p>You may end this Agreement at any time and for any reason by cancelling your Hover services. You may cancel your account by cancelling all of your services, which will cause this Agreement to terminate and Tucows will delete your account.</p>
			<p>Tucows can also end this Agreement at any time and for any reason.</p>
			<p>If you terminate this Agreement, you will not receive a refund for any fees already paid. If Tucows terminates this Agreement, Tucows will provide you with written notice, either via postal service, or email.</p>
			<p>Tucows may, in its sole discretion, refund any unused portion of your subscription fee and, if applicable, assist you in transferring your domain name to another registrar.</p>

			<h2 id="third_party_terms_icann-specific_information">Third Party Terms and ICANN-specific Information</h2>
			<p>Tucows is permitted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") and many domain name registries to register domain names on your behalf only on the condition that Tucows requires you to agree to certain additional terms, conditions and fees.</p>
			<p>These additional terms, conditions, and fees are listed in the "<a href="http://www.opensrs.com/docs/contracts/exhibita.htm">Tucows Registrant Agreement - Exhibit A</a>" ("Third-Party Terms").</p>		
			<p>ICANN also provides some information about your Rights and Responsibilities as a Registrant of a generic top-level domain (gTLD). You should review their site to ensure you understand those <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/responsibilities-2014-03-14-en" rel=”nofollow”>Registrant Rights and Responsibilities</a>. Additionally, ICANN provides some <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en" rel=”nofollow”>Registrant Educational</a> Materials that you may find helpful.</p>
			<p>The Third-Party terms are part of this Agreement, and you are bound by them just as if they were included here. In the event that this Agreement is inconsistent with any provision of the Third-Party Terms, the Third-Party Terms shall prevail.</p>

			<h2 id="compliants_legal_challenges">Complaints & Legal Challenges</h2>
			<p>Sometimes domain name registrations become the subject of a legal challenge. If Tucows is made a party to any legal action by virtue of one of your domain name registrations, you agree to be responsible for all of Tucows' costs and legal fees and to indemnify and hold Tucows harmless from any action.</p>
			<p>If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, (a) suspend your ability to use, make modifications to, or transfer your registration records and/or (b) deposit control of your registration record with the appropriate judicial entity.</p>

			<h2 id="right_to_limit_quantities_purchased">Right to Limit Quantities Purchased</h2>
			<p>We reserve the right to limit quantities purchased to normal retail purchases. From time to time we may limit the number of domain names, email addresses, and other services you may purchase from us at the published price. You agree that we may do so in our sole discretion and that our decision concerning any limitations is solely ours.</p>

			<h2 id="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</h2>
			<p>This Agreement is governed by and will be enforced in accord with the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada and the federal laws of Canada.</p>
			<p>Any action brought against Tucows arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be brought in the courts of Toronto, Ontario, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

			<h2 id="limitation_of_liability">Limitation of Liability</h2>
			<p>You agree that our entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any services provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amounts you have paid us over the last twelve months.</p>
			<p>Tucows and its directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and third party providers, ICANN, and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the services or for the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>
			<p>We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access interruptions; (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3) loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier or password; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability resulting from the interruption of your service.</p>
			<p>You agree that we will not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your domain name, or for interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

			<h2 id="disclaimer_of_warranties">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
			<p>You agree that your use of our services is solely at your own risk. You agree that such services are provided on an "as is," "as available" basis.</p>
			<p>We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement</p>
			<p>We make no warranty that the services will meet your requirements or that the services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free; nor do we make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the service or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the service or that defects in the service will be corrected.</p>
			<p>You understand and agree that any material and/or data downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of service is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of such material and/or data.</p>
			<p>We make no warranty regarding any goods or services purchased or obtained through the service or any transactions entered into through the service. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the service shall create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>
