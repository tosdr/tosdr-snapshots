If you are accepting on behalf of your employer, your company, or another entity, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms; (ii) you have read and understand these Terms; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party you represent.</p><p>By using our Platform in any manner, You are expressly agreeing to, and give Your consent to be governed by, these Terms. If You do not agree with these Terms or You do not wish to be bound by these Terms, You must not use or access the Platform in any manner.</p><h5><strong>1. The Services Provided by Teachable</strong></h5><p><strong>1.1. The Teachable Platform and Teachable Services</strong></p><p>Teachable provides an open online content creation platform designed to allow content creators (“Creators”) to build, design, publish, and sell courses, coaching offerings (“Coaching”) and other services to their end users (“Students”). Teachable provides each Creator with a dedicated Teachable environment (“school”) to host and offer their services. Teachable offers this content creation platform along with a number of additional services and tools (e.g. payment gateways, author and affiliate payouts) and the entire selection of tools and services offered via the Platform will be referred to in these Terms as &quot;Teachable Services&quot;.</p><p><strong>1.2. Relationship between Teachable and Users</strong></p><p>Teachable is neither a content provider nor an educational institution. Creators and Students are not employees of Teachable.</p><p>Teachable is not responsible for interactions between Creators and Students, with the exception of providing the technological means through which Creators may broadcast and otherwise make their courses, digital downloads, and other content (collectively, “Creator Content”) available and, at each Creator&#x27;s election, for processing payments through Teachable&#x27;s payment gateway(s). Teachable is not liable for any disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that may arise out of the Creator/Student relationship, including but not limited to, any Student&#x27;s reliance upon any information provided by a Creator or Creator Content at any time.</p><p>As stated in our Privacy Policy, Teachable only provides Creators with limited information about Students enrolled in their services, including name, email address, IP address, and the Creator offering in which the Student has enrolled. This information is only available to the Creator upon the purchase or enrollment of a Student in the Creator&#x27;s school. Teachable does not provide, sell, rent, release, disclose, or otherwise transfer Student data to Creators for monetary or other valuable consideration. Students assume full responsibility for the disclosure and use of any other personal information the Student chooses to disclose to any Creator on the Platform.</p><p><strong>1.3. The Discover Platform</strong></p><p>The Teachable Platform encompasses the Teachable Discover (&quot;Discover&quot;) platform, a marketplace that allows Users to search, find, and sign up for select Creator offerings. Discover is an overall part of the Teachable Platform, and these Terms apply in full force to the use of Discover. However, to the extent that You are a Creator being featured on Discover, the terms of the Teachable Discover Platform Agreement shall govern and take precedence in the event of any conflicts with these Terms.</p><h5><strong>2. Eligibility and Account Terms</strong></h5><p><strong>2.1 Age of Access</strong></p><p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Platform, or, if You are between the ages of 13 and 18, You must have your parent or guardian&#x27;s permission to use the Platform. By using our Platform, You are telling us by your actions that You have obtained that permission (You are &#x27;representing&#x27; and &#x27;warranting&#x27; that You have obtained the appropriate permissions to use our Platform). IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13 YOU MAY NOT USE OUR PLATFORM IN ANY MANNER NOR MAY YOU REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT.</p><p><strong>2.2 OFAC Restrictions</strong></p><p>As an express condition of being permitted to access and use the Platform, You represent and warrant that You (i) are not on a list of persons that bars You from receiving services under U.S. laws (including, without limitation, the Denied Persons List and the Entity List issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security) or other applicable jurisdiction and (iii) are not a resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela or Crimea.</p><p><strong>2.3 User Accounts</strong></p><p>To access or use certain features of the Platform, You may be required to register for an account (“Account”). For example, to enroll in a Creator’s course or other service, You will be required to create a Student Account associated with the Creator’s school. When You register for an account, You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information and to keep Your account up to date.</p><p><strong>2.4 Creator Accounts</strong></p><p>To sign up for the Platform as a Creator, you will need to open a Creator account. Creators are deemed the contracting party (“Primary Owner”) for the purposes of our Terms.</p><p>If you are signing up as a Creator on behalf of your employer, your employer shall be the Primary Owner of the account and any associated school(s). If you are signing up on behalf of your employer, then you must use your employer-issued email address and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms. When You register for a Creator Account, You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information and to keep Your account up to date.</p><p><strong>2.5 Admin User Accounts</strong></p><p>Depending on the Teachable subscription plan, a Creator may allow one or more persons (“Non-Primary Owner”) to establish an administrative account associated with a Primary Owner’s school. The Primary Owner is responsible for setting the level of access and permissions for Non-Primary Owners.</p><p>A Primary Owner is responsible and liable for the acts, omissions and defaults arising from the use of Non-Primary Owner accounts associated with their schools as if they were the Primary Owner’s own acts, omissions, or default.</p><p><strong>2.6. Account Ownership Disputes</strong></p><p>In the unlikely event that there is a dispute over the ownership of an account, Teachable has the right to request additional information from You to determine ownership and settle the dispute. The information that We may request to assist in resolving ownership disputes includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>a copy of Your photo ID;</li><li>Your business documents, including a Charter, Certificate of Incorporation, LLC</li><li>Agreement, business license, or other documentation showing ownership of Your entity;</li><li>Your billing information and details;</li><li>Certified copies of your tax forms; and</li><li>Other documentation as we deem necessary to settle the dispute</li></ul><p>Should a dispute arise, Teachable reserves the right determine the account ownership in its sole judgment, and the ability to transfer the account to the rightful owner, unless otherwise prohibited by law.</p><h5><strong>3. Code of Conduct</strong></h5><p>We have to set up some ground rules. Honestly, most of what we cover here should go without saying. However, it&#x27;s better to be upfront about things, rather than just assume everyone knows how they are expected to conduct themselves on our Platform. If You violate this Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to remove You and any of Your User Content from the Teachable Platform. Whether conduct violates our Code of Conduct will be determined in Teachable&#x27;s sole discretion.</p><p><strong>3.1 No Illegal Activity:</strong></p><p>This is about as simple as it gets. Do not use the Teachable Platform for any illegal activity. Period.

Each Creator agrees that Teachable may refund the Student in accordance with the Terms. Each Creator understands that Teachable&#x27;s obligation to pay the Creator is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Students. Teachable guarantees payments to Creators only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Teachable from Students in accordance with these Terms. In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent of the Creator, Teachable assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Creator.<br/>b) Each Student acknowledges and agrees that Teachable acts as the Creator&#x27;s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Creator. Upon payment of the funds to Teachable, the Student&#x27;s payment obligation to the Creator for the agreed amount is extinguished, and Teachable is responsible for remitting the funds to the Creator in the manner described in these Terms, which constitute Teachable&#x27;s agreement with the Student. In the event that Teachable does not remit any such amounts once successfully received from the Student, the Creator will have recourse only against Teachable and not the Student directly.</li><li><strong>Teachable Payments: </strong>The Teachable Payments gateway allows Creators to process credit or debit card transactions and facilitates faster payout processes. Teachable Payments is available to some Creators, based on location. For a list of eligible locations, please see the Teachable website.<br/>a) Creators have the option to set up Teachable Payments from their school&#x27;s Admin page. By setting up Teachable Payments, You agree to the terms that appear in these Terms and/or on the Teachable Platform regarding the Teachable Payments Gateway.<br/>b) Third Party Agreement: In setting up Teachable Payments, You may be instructed to agree to terms of service offered by Stripe.

MPG is offered wherever PayPal accounts are available and the availability of MPG is subject to any limitations by PayPal. Teachable Payments users will only be able to utilize MPG for PayPal transactions and will not be able to utilize MPG for credit card processing.<br/>a) Third Party Agreement: In setting up MPG, You may need to agree to terms of service offered by Stripe or PayPal. Stripe and PayPal are independent parties from Teachable and Teachable is not responsible for the contents of their terms of service. Should their terms of service differ from these Terms, such differences shall not modify these Terms in any manner.<br/>b) Funds paid out to Creators via MPG are paid on the first of the month (or first available business day) no earlier than thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which a sale was made. This hold period is to account for any potential losses, chargebacks, refunds, etc. For the avoidance of doubt, this hold may result in funds being paid out more than thirty (30) days after the sale to a Student. The current hold period can be located on our <a href="https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001365311-Setting-Up-the-Monthly-Payment-Gateway?irclickid=yoEUP53ZQxyPTQYxHoQTI2p2UkFV3bWCS2D0Ts0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-link&amp;utm_content=3676706&amp;utm_term=self-serve&amp;utm_campaign=933427">Knowledge Base </a>page regarding MPG.

Custom Payments Gateway:</strong> Creators on the Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans may choose to set up a Custom Payment Gateway (CPG) to process Student transactions. These transactions, which are made through a third-party payment gateway, are outside of the scope of your relationship with Teachable. You agree that Your CPG service is a third-party payment service and is not a part of the Teachable Services. Payouts are distributed according to the third-party payment service&#x27;s policies and procedures, and are not subject to any of Teachable’s policies and procedures related to payments, including the 14-day refund policy or payment hold. Furthermore, You acknowledge that:</p><ol role="list"><li>Teachable does not control any payment processing fees that may be assessed through CPG. Additionally, while Teachable may record the amounts that you owe to authors and affiliates in the transaction report, Teachable does not have the access or ability to make deductions from transaction fees processed through third-party payment gateways to pay your authors or affiliates. Creators using CPG are responsible for making payments to authors and affiliates on their own.</li><li>Teachable is not a marketplace facilitator with respect to any transactions that occur through CPG. By using CPG, You further acknowledge that Teachable does not have any responsibility to pay, remit, or otherwise collect or send to any relevant tax authorities any taxes owed, including sales taxes, on Creator Content you sell through CPG.</li></ol><p><strong>10.3 Chargebacks</strong></p><p>Creators may be charged a fee for any chargeback on credit card, debit card, or PayPal transaction that is processed through the Teachable Native Gateways. This fee is deducted from Your school&#x27;s payout but is returned to You if You win the dispute. Current fees may be found on the <a href="https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003951011?irclickid=yoEUP53ZQxyPTQYxHoQTI2p2UkFV3bWCS2D0Ts0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-link&amp;utm_content=3676706&amp;utm_term=self-serve&amp;utm_campaign=933427">Teachable Knowledge Base</a>. Fees are subject to change.</p><p><strong>10.4 Negative Balance Collections</strong></p><p>Under certain circumstances including, without limitation, refunds and chargebacks, You may incur negative balances on Your Account. In the event that You are unable to resolve such negative balances directly with Teachable within a time period determined solely by Teachable in adherence with the Federal Debt Collections Practice Act and other applicable laws, You hereby permit Teachable to appoint a collections agency solely for the limited purpose of collecting such negative balances on Your Account. You agree to pay all costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, legal expenses, collections agency fees, and other collections fees, incurred by or on behalf of Teachable in connection with the collection of any amounts due to Teachable under these Terms that are unpaid by You. Teachable will send the debt out for collection to a collection agency no sooner than payment 90 days due.  </p><h5><strong>11. Taxes</strong></h5><p>Laws governing the collection, reporting and remittance of sales and use taxes, value-added taxes and other similar state, local and foreign taxes are complex. This section of the Terms summarizes Teachable’s practices regarding these tax requirements. Please be advised that Teachable’s position on these tax matters is subject to change, without notice, and possibly with retroactive effect.</p><p>Depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdictions, Creator Content sold by Creators to Students through the Teachable platform for purchases of courses and other services and transmitted to locations inside and outside of the United States may be subject to tax.</p><p>The rate and amount of tax imposed depends on a number of factors which Teachable considers, including (without limitation):</p><ul role="list"><li>The identity of the Creator and/or Student;</li><li>The type of course or service that was purchased, and whether or not is it taxable;</li><li>The payment gateway used by the Creator (Teachable Native Gateways vs. Custom Payments Gateways); and</li><li>The shipment or delivery address of the Creator or Student, as applicable.</li></ul><p>Teachable may request additional information from its customers, which will require You to provide certain information, such as Your legal name, tax identification number, address, phone number, e-mail address, and account information for Your bank account, as necessary to fulfill its tax obligations.</p><p><strong>11.1 General Application of Sales Taxes in the United States</strong></p><p>Teachable will determine whether a transaction on the Teachable Platform is subject to tax based on the applicable laws in each state. Teachable will calculate, collect, report and remit any sales taxes collected directly to the state on whose behalf the tax is imposed. Certain states may also require the Creator to submit their own tax filings or information returns.</p><p>The tax rate applied to Your transaction will be equal to the combined applicable state and local tax rate which shall be determined by Teachable based on the information provided by the Creator and/or Student, as applicable.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Fees from Teachable Subscription Plans<br/></strong>Where applicable, Teachable will collect from the Creator sales tax that may arise in connection with Teachable subscription fees.<br/>Creators who believe that they should not be charged tax in connection to Teachable subscription fees must provide Teachable with a valid tax/identification number, a valid tax ID/tax certificate or other documentary proof issued by an appropriate taxing authority confirming that Teachable should not charge tax to the Creator in accordance with the applicable tax laws.<br/>Please note that in some situations, tax laws may require the Creator to report and remit tax itself to its tax authority with regard to subscription fees paid to Teachable (these situations are commonly referred to as &#x27;reverse charge&#x27;).</li><li><strong>Fees from the sale of Creator Content<br/></strong>For United States sales tax purposes, Teachable may be deemed to be a “marketplace facilitator” for third-party sales transacted through Teachable’s Native Payment Gateways. A “marketplace facilitator” is generally defined as the entity that owns or operates the marketplace (platform), and directly or indirectly processes transactions (including the sof physical property, digital goods and services) on behalf of third-party sellers (“marketplace sellers”).<br/>In the United States, marketplace facilitator laws and regulations shift the sales tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations from marketplace sellers to the marketplace facilitator. Therefore, where Teachable is deemed a marketplace facilitator, Teachable is responsible for calculating, collecting, remitting and refunding sales taxes on taxable products and services that are sold over Teachable’s Native Payment Gateways (i.e. Teachable Payments and Monthly Payment Gateway).<br/>Please note that where a Creator is using the Custom Payment Gateway (CPG), the Creator is solely responsible for calculating, collecting, reporting and remitting sales tax regardless of the Student’s state of residence.<br/>Creators are able to download sales reports detailing the purchase amount and the amount of tax collected on each sale through their account dashboard.<br/>It is possible that certain states will require additional marketplace facilitator collection (“Marketplace Facilitator Collection”) under new or existing laws. At its sole discretion, Teachable shall determine when it will undertake Marketplace Facilitator Collection with respect to a jurisdiction and You authorize Teachable to take all actions necessary to undertake such Marketplace Facilitator Collection. You agree to reasonably cooperate with Teachable and timely provide all information necessary for Teachable to accurately calculate, collect, report and remit such taxes including, but not limiting to, complying with the other provisions of this section. Teachable shall have sole discretion to specify the rate and taxability applied to the products and services sold. You also understand and agree that Teachable may undertake Marketplace Facilitator Collection for transactions in jurisdictions in which you do not otherwise have a substantial nexus. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, You understand and agree that Teachable will not remit to You any taxes collected as part of Marketplace Facilitator Collection. Without limiting Your obligations or liability under any other provision of these Terms, You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Teachable for any taxes, penalties, or interest on Your transactions asserted against Teachable by a jurisdiction with respect to Marketplace Facilitator Collection.<br/>Please refer to Teachable’s Knowledge Base article on United States Sales Tax and Teachable for a list of jurisdictions where Teachable collects tax as a marketplace facilitator.</li><li><strong>Exceptions<br/></strong>Teachable will not collect sales taxes in the following circumstances:<br/><strong>Creator sales over Custom Payment Gateway (CPG): </strong>Creators must calculate, collect, report and remit taxes themselves<br/><strong>Creator sales off Platform: </strong>Creators must calculate, collect, report and remit taxes themselves<br/><strong>Tax Exempt Organization: </strong>Creators or Students from tax-exempt organizations who purchase products or services on the Teachable platform will be required to pay sales taxes on the initial purchase. Thereafter, the Creator or Student should submit a refund request to tax@teachable.com. The refund request should include a copy of the purchase receipt showing the sales tax paid and the Order ID, as well as a copy of the Creator or Student’s valid tax/identification number, a valid tax ID/tax certificate or other documentary proof issued by an appropriate taxing authority confirming that Teachable should not charge tax to the Creator in accordance with the applicable tax laws. Teachable will issue a refund once the documentation has been reviewed and approved.<br/><strong>Resellers: </strong>Creator will need to provide Teachable with a tax exemption certificate issued by the state in which they are located.</li><li><strong>Additional Sales Tax Considerations<br/></strong>Teachable’s failure to collect, report and remit taxes to any governmental authority, may not relieve the Creator or Student from its sales tax obligations or liabilities within a state where applicable products and services are taxable. In certain states, a marketplace seller is still responsible for collecting and remitting sales and use taxes on sales not made on the marketplace facilitator platform. Additionally, the marketplace seller may remain liable for the sales tax if the marketplace facilitator can demonstrate that: (i) it has made a reasonable effort to obtain accurate and complete information from an unrelated marketplace seller about a retail sale, and (ii) the failure to remit the correct amount of tax was due to incorrect or incomplete information provided to the marketplace facilitator by the unrelated marketplace seller. WE ADVISE EACH CREATOR AND/OR STUDENT TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE RULES TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</li></ol><p><strong>11.2 General Application of Taxes Outside of the United States</strong></p><p>Creator and Student expressly acknowledge that an agreement is formed directly between Creator and Student for the sale of Creator Content by the Creator to the Student. Teachable is not a party to that agreement nor sets any of the terms for Creator Content sold by the Creator to the Student.</p><p>The Creator is the supplier of the Creator Content, Teachable is not responsible for interactions between Creators and Students and only provides technical means through which Creators may make their Creator Content available to Students.</p><p>As the Creator sells its Creator Content directly to the Student under its agreement with the Student, except as expressly provided in these Terms, the Creator will be solely and fully responsible to collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax (if any) to tax authorities for charges to the Students for the purchase of Creator Content. Teachable recommends Creators consult a tax advisor to assist with determining the tax requirements relating to the sale of their Creator Content.</p><p>Some countries provide for special tax laws making Teachable instead of the Creator responsible for the tax obligations pertaining to Creator Content sold by Creators while using the Teachable Native Gateways (Teachable Payments and Monthly Payment Gateway). In this regard, please note that the tax laws of the countries where Students reside generally dictate whether such a special tax law applies making Teachable instead of the Creator responsible for tax.</p><p>Therefore, in the event a Creator sells Creator Content to Students in multiple countries, different tax obligations may apply for the Creator, depending on the countries where the individual Students reside.</p><p>Please note that where a Creator is using the Custom Payment Gateway (CPG), the Creator is always solely responsible for tax, regardless of the country of residence of the Student.</p><p>The Country-Specific Guidance section contains an overview of jurisdictions where tax laws apply that shift the tax obligations for Creator Content from the Creator to Teachable in the Teachable Native Gateways model due to a deemed (by way of legal fiction) resale of Creator Content by Teachable that applies for tax purposes only.</p><p>Teachable determines the country where a Student resides for tax purposes on the basis of information the Student enters at checkout. Where needed, Teachable makes such data available to the Creator to enable the Creator to determine the amount of tax on the sale of Creator Content to a Student for which the Creator is responsible.</p><p>For information around requesting refunds and exemptions, please refer to Section 2 of the Terms of Use - <a href="https://teachable.com/terms-of-use-annex?irclickid=yoEUP53ZQxyPTQYxHoQTI2p2UkFV3bWCS2D0Ts0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-link&amp;utm_content=3676706&amp;utm_term=self-serve&amp;utm_campaign=933427">Annex</a></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Country Specific Guidance<br/></strong>Please note that Teachable is handling tax on Creator Content sold to students only in specific situations, summarized below by country.
