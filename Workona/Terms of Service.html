of Service</h1><em>Last updated: Jan 20, 2022</em><p>The following terms and conditions (the “Terms”) form a binding agreement between you, in your individual capacity or on behalf of the Organization you represent, as applicable, and Workona Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Workona”), and govern your use of the internet-based applications, software, services and websites offered by Workona (the “Services”).</p><h3>1. Customers and Authorized Users</h3><p>These Terms apply to both Customers and Authorized Users, as applicable and as set forth below.</p><p>A “Customer” is you or the Organization that you represent in agreeing to these Terms and creating an account on the Service, as indicated by you at the time of your creation of an account. If you create an account but do not have the necessary organizational authority to enter into the Terms on behalf of such Organization, then you as an individual are the Customer. For example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but haven’t formed a company yet, you are the Customer. However if you sign up using a primary email address with a domain owned by your company, and you have the necessary authority to bind your company to these Terms, then your company is the Customer.</p><p>An “Authorized User” is a person who a Customer, or a person with admin access on a Customer’s account, has invited to participate in a Customer account.</p><p>An “Organization” is a corporation, limited liability company, company or other legal entity other than a natural person.</p><h3>2. Acceptance of the Terms</h3><p>By creating an account, or by entering into an agreement to purchase a Subscription (as defined below), you agree, as an individual or on behalf of the Organization that you represent, as applicable, to be bound by these Terms as Customer.</p><p>By accepting an invitation to join an account created by a Customer or otherwise indicating your assent to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms as an Authorized User of a Customer’s Subscription.</p><p>In either case, you represent and warrant that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms, (2) you are at least 13 years of age, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the Terms (on behalf of yourself or, if applicable, the Organization that you represent). If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. Our Services are not designed for users under the age of 13, and if you are younger than 13 you may not use the Service.</p><p>These terms incorporate by reference the Workona Privacy Policy available at<!-- --> <a class="style_link__Dqewf" href="https://workona.com/policies/privacy">https://workona.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p><h3>3. Changes to the Terms</h3><p>These Terms are subject to occasional revision. We will notify you of any changes to our Terms by posting the new Terms on the Services and updating the “Last Updated” date below. We will also notify you of material changes by sending an email to the email address you have provided to us. For existing Customers and Authorized Users, any changes to these Terms will be effective thirty calendar days following notification of such change, and for new Customers and Authorized Users entering into these Terms after the new “Last Updated” date, these changes will be effective immediately. Continued use of the Services following such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the updated version of these Terms.</p><h3>4. Access to the Service</h3><p>A Customer may enter into an agreement with Workona to purchase a subscription to access and use the Service, subject to these Terms (a “Subscription”). Workona may, in its sole discretion, also offer Customers the ability to access and use the Service without payment, subject to these Terms (an “Unpaid Subscription”).</p><p>Workona may terminate any Unpaid Subscription at any time, in its sole discretion, without liability to the applicable Customer or any Authorized User. In the case of a Subscription, Customer and its Authorized Users will be permitted to access and use the Service for the period set forth in such Subscription. In all events, Workona reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service with or without notice and without liability to any Customer or Authorized User. If you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to cease access to the Services.</p><h3>5. Use of the Services</h3><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">a.  In order to access the Service, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details). It is your responsibility to ensure that such information is accurate and up to date.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">b.  You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are (a) permitted by the Terms and (b) in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">c.  You agree not to access (or attempt to access) the Service through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">d.  You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">e.  You agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, attempt to create a substitute or similar service through use of or access to, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">f.  You agree that you will not (and you will not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Services or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">g.  You agree that you will not transmit to Workona any: (i) “personal data” (as defined by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation), (ii) “protected health information” (as defined by the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), or (iii) any other data that is subject to regulation, without first entering into a separate agreement with Workona regarding such transmission and processing of such data, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws. You acknowledge and agree that Workona does not screen the content that you submit to Workona, and as such relies on your compliance with this paragraph.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">h.  You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and Content while using the Services and for any consequences thereof.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">i.  You agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of your password and any other account information. You agree to notify Workona immediately at<!-- --> <a class="style_link__Dqewf" href="mailto:support@workona.com">support@workona.com</a> <!-- -->it you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">j.  You agree that for each Customer account, certain users assigned by Customer (“Admin Users”) may have administrative privileges which can access and modify your Content on the Service, and may remove your ability to access the Customer account and such Content. You agree that Workona will have no liability to you for actions taken by Admin Users.</p><h3>6. Organization Accounts</h3><p>If the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is determined by Workona to be owned by an Organization (for example by Workona’s detection of the account as a Google Workspace account or by reference to websites published by Organizations), then some of your account information (such as your username) will automatically be visible to other users who have registered with email addresses with the same domain.</p><p>If an authorized representative of the Organization that owns the domain of the primary email address associated with your account wishes to purchase a Subscription and add you to its account, then certain information concerning your existing account will become accessible to that Organization’s Admin Users, including your name and email address, and your account and related Content will be added to the Organization’s account without your prior consent.</p><p>If you do not intend to share such information and Content as described in this Section 6, then you must create your account using a personal email address instead of an email address owned by an Organization. If you believe Workona has incorrectly identified your email address as being owned by an Organization, please notify us in writing at support@workona.com.</p><h3>7. Billing and Payment</h3><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">a.  For each Subscription, Workona will bill the Customer in advance for use of the Services in the amount and on the frequency indicated in the Subscription. Workona reserves the right to modify pricing at any time, subject to compliance with the terms of any existing Subscriptions for the term thereof, in which case price increases during such term will go into effect upon renewal of the Subscription. If a Customer upgrades to a higher pricing level or tier, Workona will credit any remaining balance from previous Subscription payment to your new level or tier. All fees paid for a Subscription are non-refundable.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">b.  Each Customer agrees to maintain valid and up-to-date credit-card billing information on file with Workona. Customer may update this billing information at any time in the settings on its account with Workona. Workona may permit, in its sole discretion, payment by invoice, if agreed upon in writing by Workona.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">c.  All payments due are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise agreed in writing by Workona. Payments by credit card are due upon commencement of the Subscription and each renewal thereafter. Payments by invoice are due 10 days after invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Late payments will be charged interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by law). Customer will pay all reasonable expenses incurred by Workona in collecting late payments, including attorneys fees. Workona may suspend or downgrade Customer’s account if fees are not paid when due.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">d.  At the end of each Subscription, such Subscription will automatically renew for successive terms equal to the original Subscription term, unless Customer terminates the Subscription prior to such renewal.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">e.  Customer is responsible for any taxes, duties, and customs fees associated with its Subscription (other than Workona’s income tax) (collectively “Taxes”), and Customer will pay Workona all amounts due under its Subscription without any reduction for Taxes. If Workona is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide Workona with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to Workona, you must provide Workona with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</p><h3>8. Content in the Services</h3><p>You understand that all information and web content which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services (the “Content”) is the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. By using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk. Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who own such Content.

You agree that you are solely responsible for any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Workona may suffer) by doing so.</p><h3>9. Proprietary rights</h3><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">a.  You acknowledge and agree that Workona owns and retains all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights related thereto (whether registered or unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by Workona and that you shall not disclose such information without Workona’s prior written consent.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">b.  Workona hereby grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, and non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Services in compliance with these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that you obtain no intellectual property rights under these Terms, except for the limited license explicitly contained herein.</p><p class="style_indent__MrTp9">c.  You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, share, upload, post or display on or through the Services.

You agree that you will not submit, share, upload, post or display Content on or through the Service that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to submit, share, upload, post or display the Content and to grant Workona all of the license rights granted herein.</p><h3>10.
