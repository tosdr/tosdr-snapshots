You may exercise these rights as described in the “Your Choices and Rights” section above, or by emailing us at<!-- --> <a class="style_link__SsNOs" href="mailto:privacy@workona.com">privacy@workona.com</a>. California residents also have the right to request additional details about our information practices and to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights. After submitting a request to access or delete your personal data, please monitor your email address associated with your Workona account for correspondence from Workona aimed at verifying your identity before we process your request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with written authority to submit requests on your behalf. We may also require that you confirm your request and your identity directly with Workona.</li><li>Workona does not sell the personal information of its users in the traditional sense (i.e., in exchange for payment). However, the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly, including in such a way that transfers of information relating to advertising cookies could be considered a sale. As described above and in our<!-- --> <a class="style_link__SsNOs" href="/policies/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>, we may share your personal data with advertising partners so that they can show ads promoting Workona on other properties. If you are a California resident, and to the extent that any of these services are considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, then you have the right to opt-out of the sale. You may opt out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising purposes as described in the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above.</li></ul><h3>European Economic Area and United Kingdom Disclosure</h3><p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), please review this additional information.</p><p><strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong></p><p>When we process your personal data, we will only do so in the following situations:</p><ul><li>We have your consent to do so. For example, we may ask your consent to send you marketing communications.</li><li>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the Services you have requested).</li><li>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data to communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.</li></ul><p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p><ul><li>You have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data, including the right to access, review, modify, and delete your personal data. You may exercise your rights by following the instructions under “Your Choices” above, or by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Policy. Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain personal information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In addition, certain choices may make it impossible to provide the Services. For instance, if you ask us to delete all your personal information and no exception applies, we will no longer be able to provide the Services since certain personal information, such as an email address, are needed to provide the Services. We will inform you when you will need to permanently delete your account in order to satisfy a request you have made.</li></ul><p><strong>Questions or Complaints</strong></p><ul><li>If you are located
