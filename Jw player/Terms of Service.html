<p>Enterprise Edition Publishers under the Standard JW7 Terms of Service may elect and shall be deemed to upgrade to the then-current JW Player version 8.x and shall be subject to these Terms of Service by Using such version 8.x, provided, (a) Publisher&#8217;s Use of JW Player version 7.x is not pursuant to any mutually agreed document that materially alters the terms of the Standard JW 7 Terms of Service; and (b) Publisher is not in breach of any of its obligations to Company. By electing such upgrade, Publisher acknowledges that its Order Form (including any Plays or volumes set forth therein) remains operative throughout the remainder of the Term and such upgrade does not create any duplicative right.</p>
<h2>Publisher License</h2>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Publisher&#8217;s observance thereof, Company hereby grants to Publisher and Publisher hereby accepts a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license, solely for the Purpose, to (a) Use, access and install the Products, (b) Use, access, integrate and install the SDKs, (c) make and distribute Documentation internally, (d) publicly Distribute SDK Applications for the Operating Systems, (e) Use JW Showcase, and (f) operate and allow End Users of SDK Applications and JW Showcase Implementations to operate JW Player incorporated into such SDK Applications and JW Showcase Implementations.</p>

<h2>OEM License</h2>
<p>Upon explicit written approval by the Company to act as an OEM and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Publisher&#8217;s observance thereof, the Company grants, in object code form, to Publisher, a non-exclusive, limited subscription license, solely for the Purpose, to (a) incorporate the object code version of the applicable Products in the Application Package, (b) reproduce and distribute the applicable Products as incorporated into the Application Package, (c) modify and enhance the applicable Products as incorporated into the Application Package, and (d) reproduce and distribute any such modifications or enhancements, subject to the License Scope listed above. The foregoing rights may be sublicensed through multiple tiers of distribution, including resellers, provided each reseller or other distributor is contractually required to abide by the requirements of this Section. Publisher shall ensure that any Application Package incorporating the applicable Products shall be governed by a license agreement that is at least as protective to the Company as are the Company&#8217;s Terms of Service in the Application Package. Unless explicit written approval is given by Company to Publisher to act as an OEM, any references to OEM terms, such as an OEM License, OEM Support, or other OEM provisions, shall be inapplicable.</p>
<p>An OEM License may be authorized only in connection with the Enterprise Edition. Publishers with any Edition other than Enterprise Edition and Publishers with an Enterprise Edition without an OEM License authorized on an applicable Order Form are strictly prohibited from incorporating a Product into any Application Package or incorporating a Product into any goods or services, other than those authorized under subsections (i) – (iii) of the Purpose. Publisher is strictly prohibited from incorporating a Product into any goods or services, other than with respect to the authorized Application Package and those authorized under subsections (i) – (iii) of the Purpose.</p>
<p>Publisher shall be responsible for all OEM Support under the OEM License. OEM may assign up to five (5) designated support contacts from OEM&#8217;s company to contact the Company by providing notice to the Company. OEM&#8217;s customers may not contact the Company directly for OEM Support. OEM further agrees, at its own expense, to be adequately trained on providing Product support to OEM&#8217;s customers.</p>
<h2>License Scope</h2>
<p>The License Scope varies by Edition and the licenses granted hereunder are limited accordingly. Unless otherwise provided, licenses are personal to Publisher for its own Use. If you would like more information about upgrading to the Enterprise Edition, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/?hsLang=en">www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/</a>&nbsp;or sales@jwplayer.com.</p>
<p>Editions have the following License Scope (volume per month where applicable)**:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://jwplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/license-scope.jpg" alt="" width="1820" height="626"></p>
<p>+&#8221;Free&#8221; license edition was previously referred to as &#8220;Developer.&#8221;</p>
<p>* License Scope for the Enterprise Edition shall be as explicitly provided on an applicable Order Form or checkout page, and where License Scope items are provided on the applicable Order Form but limits are not explicitly set, Content Plays shall be limited to 200,000, Websites shall be limited to 1, Hosting shall be limited to 150 GB, and Streaming shall be limited to 500 GB. Except as explicitly provided on an applicable Order Form, Ad Plays for Editions with ads enabled shall be limited to the applicable number of Content Plays, and Overage Rates for Ad Plays shall be equal to that for Content Plays. Except as explicitly agreed to otherwise, Overage Rates for Content Plays for all Editions other than Enterprise and Enterprise Trial shall be $2.50 per thousand.</p>
<p>^Content hosted using our Services utilizes more GBs than the uploaded Content because the Services creates multiple versions of the Content at various resolutions.</p>

<p>In order to ensure maximum performance and protect the experience of all users, requests to the JW Platform API (presently accessed via api.jwplatform.com) may not exceed sixty (60) per minute, or any other limit set forth in the applicable technical documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not limit Publisher&#8217;s Plays per minute and reflects a number of requests unlikely to be reached through normal Use, the excess of which would be abusive. In addition to any other remedies provided by these Terms of Service, the Company reserves the right to immediately suspend accounts that exceed the maximum API requests set forth herein and to terminate, block and/or blacklist such accounts if Company believes in its reasonable discretion that such excess is due to Publisher&#8217;s abusive behavior.</p>
<p>Publishers using the Free Edition or Developer Edition may not modify or customize the menu that appears when an End User right-clicks (or other equivalent action) on a video.</p>
<p>Live Streaming Usage shall also count against the Streaming limits.</p>
<h2>Advertisements</h2>
<p>Publishers who have not purchased the Platinum Edition, Business Edition, Enterprise Trial Edition or ads-enabled Enterprise Edition are strictly prohibited from using the Products in any manner to display advertisements. Such prohibition includes actions such as (i) the making or use of any Adaptation that enables any type of advertisement to be shown in, on or around the Products (e.g., a skin), (ii) interoperation of the Products with any software that serves advertisements and (iii) adding advertisements to a playlist.</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Publisher is strictly prohibited from providing false or misleading sign-up information, including using a name, address or email address owned or controlled by another person without appropriate authorization. Company reserves the right to refuse registration or cancel any account that it reasonably believes is in violation of the foregoing. Publisher shall be responsible for maintaining the secrecy of its password and is liable for all activities that occur on its account. Publisher agrees to immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized use of Publisher&#8217;s username, password or other breach of account security.</p>
<h2>Adaptations</h2>
<p>Publisher is authorized to make Adaptations reasonably necessary to exercise its rights under these Terms of Service. All Adaptations created by Publisher are strictly for Use in connection with the Purpose. Publisher is solely responsible to ensure that its Adaptations (except the Products incorporated therein) comply with all applicable laws and regulations and do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.

<p>For the purposes of these Terms of Service, &#8220;Beta Products&#8221; means products, features, programs or services identified by Company as beta products, or which are made available by Company to Beta Participant and which are not yet generally available. If Publisher Uses any Beta Products, Publisher&#8217;s Use of any such Beta Product(s) constitutes unconditional agreement to be bound by, and such Use shall be subject to, the JW Player&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/beta-program-agreement?hsLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beta Program Agreement</a>&nbsp;with respect to such Beta Product(s).</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Except pursuant to the Purpose or as otherwise specifically set forth herein, Publisher shall not Distribute, re-license, sell, lease, transfer, encumber, assign or make available for public use the Products or any Adaptation thereof. Any attempt to take any such actions is void and constitutes a material breach of these Terms of Service.</p>
<h2>Term</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service shall become effective on the Effective Date. For all Editions other than the (i) Enterprise Trial Edition or (ii) Enterprise Edition if otherwise set forth on an applicable Order Form, these Terms of Service shall remain effective for a period of one (1) year (the &#8220;Initial Term&#8221;). Upon the conclusion of the Initial Term, these Terms of Service shall automatically renew for additional successive one (1) year terms, except in the case of the Enterprise Edition which shall renew for additional successive terms for the same period as the Initial Term (each a &#8220;Renewal Term&#8221; and together with the Initial Term and any Negotiation Period(s), the &#8220;Term&#8221;). Such renewal shall be at the then-current non-promotional rate, unless Publisher opts out of auto-renewal by electing to not renew these Terms of Service as set forth in the following paragraph. The Enterprise Trial Edition&#8217;s Term shall be 30 days unless otherwise mutually agreed by Publisher and Company and set forth on an applicable Order Form.</p>
<p>Either party may elect to not renew these Terms of Service by notifying the other prior to the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term. Such notice may be provided by Publisher either via email to customer support or through the Publisher dashboard. Notice for the Enterprise Edition must be provided in writing no later than thirty (30) days prior to such expiration. If Publisher terminates these Terms of Service, Publisher may use Publisher&#8217;s subscription until the end of Publisher&#8217;s then-current term and Publisher&#8217;s subscription will not be renewed after Publisher&#8217;s then-current term expires. However, Publisher won&#8217;t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF PUBLISHER DOES NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS, PUBLISHER MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TERMS OF SERVICE BY NOTIFYING COMPANY BEFORE THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT INITIAL TERM OR RENEWAL TERM, WHICH FOR ENTERPRISE EDITION SHALL BE NO LATER THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT INITIAL TERM OR RENEWAL TERM. THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, COMPANY WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID.</p>
<p>Publisher&#8217;s non-termination or continued use of Products or Editions reaffirms that Company is authorized to charge Publisher&#8217;s designated payment form for such Products or Editions. Company may submit those charges for payment and Publisher will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Company&#8217;s right to seek payment directly from Publisher. Publisher&#8217;s charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when Publisher initially selected to use the Products or Editions. Publisher hereby acknowledges that it will not receive notice of a renewal cancellation date or automatic renewal and expressly waives the application of New York General Obligations Law Section 5-903, and any similar laws, to the renewal of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>If Company has provided notice of non-renewal to an Enterprise Edition Publisher in accordance with the above mechanism, and the parties are negotiating in good faith to agree a new Order Form, and Publisher continues to Use the products beyond the effective date of expiration without such new Order Form having been executed by a duly authorized representative of each party, Publisher will be deemed to have renewed for a one (1) month term (a &#8220;Negotiation Period&#8221;); provided that Company may in its sole discretion notify Publisher that such Negotiation Period will not occur, in which case these Terms of Service will expire as provided herein. Publisher will for the Negotiation Period be invoiced, and will pay in accordance with the payment terms herein, one-twelfth of the annual Fees provided on the applicable Order Form, and the License Scope for Content Plays, Hosting and Streaming will be one-twelfth of the annual limits provided on such Order Form. The Negotiation Period will not renew without the written consent (email sufficing) of Company. The foregoing shall not affect either party&#8217;s rights to terminate these Terms of Service as provided herein.</p>
<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service are subject to termination by Company immediately and/or Publisher&#8217;s account may be suspended if (a) Publisher fails to timely pay a Fee or Overages, (b) Publisher violates any term of these Terms of Service, including the provisions regarding Prohibited Content or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos-content-guidelines?hsLang=en">Content Guidelines</a>&nbsp;(c) Publisher becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy or a receiver or trustee is appointed for Publisher, (d) Publisher is or becomes engaged in a business that is competitive with the Company&#8217;s business, or (e) Publisher exceeds the License Scope permitted for its Edition and Publisher fails to cure any of the foregoing within seven (7) days of notice thereof.</p>
<p>Enterprise Edition Terms of Service shall not be terminable for convenience by either party. Company may terminate Free Edition, Developer Edition, Starter Edition, Business Edition, Premium Edition, Platinum Edition and Enterprise Trial Edition Terms of Service for its convenience on seven (7) days&#8217; notice.</p>
<p>In the event of any termination by the Company pursuant to (a) – (e) above, the Company is under no obligation to provide a refund for the Fees received from Publisher or apply such fees to future services. In the event of the Company&#8217;s termination for convenience, Publisher shall, on its request, be given a pro rata refund of unused pre-paid Fees. In the event Publisher switches to a different Edition, any pre-paid Fee balance shall be applied towards the Fees due for such Edition until exhausted; no refund shall be available for Publishers switching to a Free Edition or a Developer Edition.</p>
<h2>Effects of Termination</h2>
<p>Upon expiration or termination of these Terms of Service for any reason, Publisher shall immediately cease Use the Products and uninstall, delete and destroy any copies of the Licensed Programs under its control. In the event any Products are no longer under Publisher&#8217;s control (such as SDK Applications already in the marketplace), Publisher shall use its best efforts to cause use of such Products to promptly cease, including updating SDK Applications and other OEM uses.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, if Publisher fails to cease Use of the Products or Services following expiration or termination, Publisher will continue to pay the Fees and Overages. To the extent that such continued use is due to Products no longer under Publisher&#8217;s control, such Fees shall be pro rata based on the volume of ongoing Use, until such Use ceases.</p>
<p>Upon expiration or termination, Company may delete any Content, information, files or materials in or related to Publisher&#8217;s account, and Company will have no obligation whatsoever to save or make any such Content, information, files or materials available to Publisher or any other party. Publisher agrees that Company will have no liability whatsoever to Publisher or any other party related to termination of access to Publisher&#8217;s account or as a result of the deletion or loss of any Content, information, files or materials in or related to Publisher&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>Upon expiration or termination, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease, except that all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of expiration or termination and remedies for breach of these Terms of Service shall survive. The provisions of the Sections titled Effects of Termination, Intellectual Property, Privacy, Fees and Payment, Content, Representations and Warranties, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Basis of the Bargain, Indemnity, Audit, Confidential Information, Severability, Choice of Law and Jurisdiction, Injunctive Relief, Complete Agreement and Waiver of Breach shall also survive.</p>

Publisher&#8217;s sole remedy for any disruption (as determined by checking the response of a Product&#8217;s HTTP API) or failure to provide support shall be a pro rata refund of the Fee paid by Publisher for the relevant period.

Publisher will pay all amounts agreed to in a monetary settlement of the Claims and all Losses that result or arise from the Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Publisher shall have no duty to indemnify or defend the Company from Claims which primarily allege that Products, as provided to Publisher by the Company and used in accordance with the terms hereof, infringe the copyright, patent or trademark rights of a third party.</p>
<h2>DMCA</h2>
<p>Hosting and Streaming Services shall be subject to the Company&#8217;s published DMCA policy, which is incorporated by reference herein and available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/dmca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.jwplayer.com/dmca</a>. If you believe that any materials distributed through the Company&#8217;s Hosting and Streaming Services violate a copyright that you hold, please follow the steps set forth in that DMCA policy.</p>
<h2>Audit</h2>
<p>Enterprise Edition and Platinum Edition Publishers whose Fees are based in whole or in part on Publisher-hosted Licensed Programs shall keep complete and accurate records of all Use during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter. Company may periodically conduct audits of such Publishers to confirm the accuracy of Fees paid and compliance with the applicable License Scope. Such audits shall be conducted no more than one (1) time per year, by an independent certified public accountant, at the place of business where Publisher customarily keeps such records, during normal business hours, and upon fifteen (15) days&#8217; advance written notice. Company shall bear the full cost of all audits, provided, if an audit reveals that Fees or Overages have been underpaid or the License Scope has been exceeded by at least five percent (5%), Publisher shall, in addition to payment of any underpaid Fees and Overages and any other remedies due under these Terms of Service, reimburse Company for its professional fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in conducting such audit.</p>
<h2>Confidential Information</h2>
<p>Publisher acknowledges that it may have access to certain confidential information of the Company, such as information concerning its business, plans, customers, technology and products (&#8220;Confidential Information&#8221;). Confidential Information will include all information in tangible or intangible form that is marked or designated as confidential or that, under the circumstances of its disclosure, should reasonably be considered confidential. &#8220;Confidential Information&#8221; shall not include (a) information that becomes known to the general public without breach of the nondisclosure obligations of these Terms of Service; (b) information that is already known to Publisher at the time that it is disclosed to the receiving party; (c) information that is obtained from a third party without breach of a nondisclosure obligation and without restriction on disclosure; and (d) information that has been independently developed by Publisher without reference to any of the disclosing party&#8217;s Confidential Information.</p>
<p>Publisher agrees that it will not use Confidential Information in any way for its own account or the account of any third party, except as expressly permitted by, or required to achieve the purposes of, these Terms of Service, nor will it disclose to any third party (except as required by law or its attorneys, accountants and other advisors as reasonably necessary) any of the Confidential Information and it will take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of such information, at least as stringent as it takes to protect its own Confidential Information. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms of Service for any reason or at Company&#8217;s request at any time, Publisher will return or destroy, at the Company&#8217;s request, all Confidential Information and all documents or media containing any such Confidential Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof.</p>
<h2>Publicity</h2>
<p>Company shall be permitted to publicly identify Publisher as a user of the Products, including on Company&#8217;s websites and marketing materials. Publisher hereby grants Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license during the Term to use Publisher&#8217;s name and marks for this purpose. Company agrees to state on all materials using Publisher&#8217;s marks that such marks are property of Publisher and to include the trademark registration symbol if applicable. All goodwill arising out of any use of any of the Publisher&#8217;s marks by Company will inure solely to the benefit of Publisher.</p>
<p>Company may display the words &#8220;Powered by JW Player&#8221; and the JW Player version number in the menu that appears when an End User right clicks (or other equivalent action) on a video. Publisher is prohibited from disabling this feature unless otherwise provided on an applicable Order Form.</p>
<h2>Independent Contractors</h2>
<p>The parties hereto are independent contractors and nothing herein constitutes or creates an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or representative relationship between the parties.</p>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>Publisher agrees and certifies that it will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Products contrary to the laws of the United States or any other country from or to which such export or re-export may occur.</p>
<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Terms of Service shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effectuate the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<h2>Choice of Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except that body of law controlling conflict of laws) and specifically excluding from application to this Agreement that law known as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the parties or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to these Terms of Service or the subject matter thereof.</p>
<h2>Injunctive Relief</h2>
<p>Publisher acknowledges and agrees that unauthorized Use of the Products or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause the Company irreparable harm for which its remedies at law may be inadequate. Publisher hereby agrees that the Company will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to obtain immediate injunctive relief to prevent such unauthorized actions.</p>
<h2>Complete Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the Company and Publisher with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. ANY PURCHASE ORDER OR OTHER SIMILAR DOCUMENT PROVIDED BY OR RECEIVED FROM A PARTY SHALL NOT MODIFY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR GOVERN PUBLISHER&#8217;S USE OF THE PRODUCTS UNLESS EXECUTED BY BOTH PARTIES&#8217; DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES. EACH PARTY REJECTS ANY TERMS CONTAINED IN PURCHASE ORDERS OR SIMILAR DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE OTHER PARTY, AND ANY SUCH TERMS SHALL BE VOID AND HAVE NO LEGAL EFFECT. RESTRICTIVE ENDORSEMENTS OR OTHER STATEMENTS ON CHECKS ACCEPTED BY COMPANY SHALL NOT BE ENFORCEABLE.</p>
<h2>Modification</h2>
<p>The Company may modify the terms of these Terms of Service in its sole discretion and such modifications shall take effect and be binding on Publisher on the earliest date on which they are posted to the Company&#8217;s publicly available website or delivered to Publisher via electronic or physical delivery to the last known physical or email address provided to the Company. No one other than the Company has the right to modify these Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification or amendment to a mutually ratified Addendum or Order Form shall be effective unless in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of each party.</p>
<h2>No Assignment</h2>
<p>Publisher may not assign or transfer this agreement to any third party without the Company&#8217;s express written consent. Any other assignment or transfer shall be void and in the event of such unauthorized assignment or transfer the Company may immediately terminate these Terms of Service.</p>
<h2>Waiver of Breach</h2>
<p>No term or provision of these Terms of Service shall be deemed waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the Company. Any consent by the Company to, or waiver of, a breach by Publisher whether expressed or implied, shall not constitute consent to, waiver of, or excuse for, any other breach or any subsequent breach, except as may be expressly provided by the Company.</p>
