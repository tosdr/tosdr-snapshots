			Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
		</p>
		<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Protemos LLC cancels it. You may cancel
			your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Protemos LLC customer support team.</p>
		<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Protemos LLC with accurate and complete
			billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
			automatically authorize Protemos LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
		<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Protemos LLC will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date,
			with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
		<p>You can cancel your subscription any time. Refund is possible within 14 days after the date of license payment.</p>

		<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
