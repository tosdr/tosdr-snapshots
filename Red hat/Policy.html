Named Participants will be asked to acknowledge and agree to the taking of video recordings of their face, image, desk, workspace and possible audio recordings during the exam for Red Hat’s legitimate interests in processing such data for the purposes of exam quality, security and the integrity of the exam process. In order to proceed with taking a Red Hat exam, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge and agree to being continuously by video and audio in real time by a combination of a human proctor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine while taking the exam (more details on the use of AI are immediately above under "Individual Exam Monitoring"), the processing of such personal data by Red Hat and its third party data processors, and the transfer of such data to Red Hat and its authorized third party data processors in the United States or other countries where they are located. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge that they have no expectation of privacy as regards their face, image, audio or actions during the exam, and agree to waive any and all claims asserting a violation of their right to privacy during the exam insofar as such claims pertain to the recording of their face, image, audio or actions during the exam. If Named Participants do not agree to be recorded by video or audio for the purposes as described, they will not be allowed to proceed with the exam.</li><li><p><strong>Maintenance of Exam Data and Digital Artifacts:</strong> Red Hat saves and stores various digital artifacts associated with Individual Exams, including disk images for the virtual machines used during an exam, the video recording of the exam session, and chat logs, among other elements. Except where required by applicable law, Red Hat is not responsible for the loss of digital artifacts due to causes beyond Red Hat’s reasonable control, including, but not necessarily limited to, hosting facility error or negligence, fire, theft, vandalism, war, acts of foreign governments, or other force majeure events.<br>Individual Exams are subject to the Red Hat Exam Privacy and Confidentiality Agreement. Violation of these policies or other behavior that suggests misconduct may result in the remote monitor pausing or terminating an exam.</p><p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exams</strong><br>Red Hat Remote Exams provide an individual online testing option that is both convenient and flexible. A Named Participant is responsible for providing their own device and connectivity. Red Hat Remote Exams are certification exams delivered through a configured and restricted live environment for the sole purpose of delivering the Red Hat Remote Exam. Nothing is installed on Named Participants’ systems during the exam session and Red Hat does not save any information or hold any information on the devices after Named Participants log out from their exam session.</p><p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam-Specific Compatibility Test:</strong> Named Participants are required to run a compatibility test from within the Remote Exam live environment in advance of their scheduled exam date preferably at the same time of day as the scheduled exam. This allows Named Participants to check the compatibility of the hardware and network that they plan on using to take the exam. Named Participants can only proceed with their scheduled Red Hat Remote Exam if their compatibility test is successful. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the compatibility test is completed in advance of the scheduled exam. Named Participants are advised to cancel the scheduled exam and not to reschedule until they have resolved the issues raised by the compatibility test. A successful run of the compatibility tool does not guarantee the absence of issues when the exam is delivered. Because Named Participants will use their personally provided device, location and network, Red Hat cannot troubleshoot these for any of the Named Participants. In the event there are problems that significantly impede Named Participants’ ability to take the exam, Red Hat at its sole discretion will allow the Named Participant to discontinue and reschedule the exam at a later date.</p></li><li><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam System and Hardware Requirements:</strong><ul><li>Named Participants electing to take a Remote Exam must meet certain system and hardware requirements as published by Red Hat under <a href="https://learn.redhat.com/t5/Certification-Resources/Getting-Ready-for-your-Red-Hat-Remote-Exam/ba-p/12690">Getting Ready for your Red Hat Remote Exam</a> and provided to Named Participants.

If a Named Participant’s workspace does not pass a room scan, they will not be permitted to proceed with the exam. Suitability of the exam workspace is entirely at Red Hat’s discretion and an exam may be cancelled or rescheduled for any of the aforementioned reasons or for reasons other than those mentioned herein.</li><li>Only one physical display will be allowed for the exam. Named Participants must turn off and unplug any additional laptops, computers, monitors, displays or any other personal equipment or hardware in their workspace other than the computer or laptop used for the exam.
