Since that time, as we’ve continued to improve and support the Gradescope product you know and love, we’ve also been settling into our new home. This has included improving our policies and practices, including but not limited to those around privacy and security. As a result, we are adopting a new, <a href="https://go.turnitin.com/privacy">companywide privacy policy</a>, which you can find below. If you have any questions or concerns about the changes, as always please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:help@gradescope.com">help@gradescope.com</a>.</p>

<p>Turnitin respects your privacy and vigorously protects your personal data. We work hard to achieve extremely high levels of security through the use of appropriate technical and organisational measures which are described below. Turnitin complies with the relevant security standards of the US, EU and Switzerland. The Privacy Policy below is reviewed regularly in line with changes in global legislation. For the purposes of this policy, ‘personal data’ shall have the meaning ascribed to it under the definition of ‘personal data’ under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR).

<h2 id="privacy-pledge">Privacy Pledge</h2>

<div class="quote">
  <p>Integrity is at the heart of all we do; it defines us.</p>

  <p>- Chris Caren, CEO of Turnitin</p>
</div>

<p>The Privacy Policy below covers the kind of personal data we collect (and how), what we do with it, and how we protect any personal data you provide. Protecting your personal data is our top priority.
We are fully committed to transparency and using technology responsibly, no matter what changes emerge from our rapidly evolving digital world;
As we strive to create new possibilities in education, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards. We strive to adhere to the strictest privacy practices so that your trust is well-deserved; and
Because your peace of mind is important to us, we guard your personal data with the utmost care. We use it only for lawful reasons.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><strong>Last Updated: 12th October 2022</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all businesses and group companies of Turnitin. This policy describes how Turnitin collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal data you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and changes to your personal data. Data collected through our service will be limited solely to the purpose of providing the service for which you (the Client) have engaged Turnitin. If and when a third-party company provides a related service to support our service, such as language translation, we make sure that when personal data is processed by them, we require that those third-party companies meet our security standards and those of the applicable legislation that applies from time to time. We refer to the collective sites run by Turnitin as the “Site.”</p>

<h3>Why we collect personal data</h3>

<p>When you create an account with us, or when a student has their work processed by Turnitin, we process personal data (such as name, email address, job title, and school) so that we can correctly administer your account and provide you with the best customer service. All personal data we process is directly linked to a specific purpose, such as requesting access to our academic content database, sending grading data to your LMS or requesting web content (i.e. a newsletter, case study, video, etc.).
At any time, you can access, update, rectify or erase any personal data by logging into your account and clicking “User Info” (“Edit Account” on Gradescope) or contacting Customer Support. Please see our Privacy Policy for more detailed information about how we protect your personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Protecting your data</h3>

<p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times. Depending on the Turnitin solution used, personal data is processed either:</p>

<p>1) both in Europe and in the United States, in the case of most products</p>

<p>2) entirely within Europe, Canada, Australia, or the United States depending on the institution’s preference, except for text recognition performed on handwritten formulas, which requires some data processing within the US, in the case of the Gradescope product</p>

<p>In all of the cases above, we have robust technical and organizational safeguards in place to protect such personal data. Passwords are required to access your personal data, so please remember to keep your password confidential. Even with the best security systems, it is impossible to guarantee 100% protection from hackers and unauthorized third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>

<p>When a paper is submitted to any of Turnitin’s products with the exception of Gradescope, it is compared against a vast, secure proprietary database of licensed source material, including millions of periodicals, academic journals, books, and web pages. Turnitin also maintains a separate repository of student papers. Each institution (at the discretion of his or her school administrator) can determine whether or not to include student papers in the repository and whether or not to give students the option to opt out. We can remove student papers from the standard repository at the request of a school administrator.</p>

<p>When a teacher, professor, or other representative acting on behalf of a school or other institution uploads data to Gradescope, this may include personally identifiable information about students. We may then collect an email address and password from these students, which is combined with student information received from the teacher and/or school. We use the personal information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of Gradescope, to analyze our offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our users: teachers, schools, students and website visitors. We retain user data on the Gradescope service only as long as necessary to deliver our services. Data associated with a given account is retained until the account owner or an institution, on behalf of the account owner, submits a deletion request.</p>

<h3>What’s most important</h3>

<h4>1. Compliance</h4>
<p>Turnitin serves a global community of educators and students, whose views on data privacy may differ significantly. Our products and services, as well as our privacy policies, are regularly audited and inspected by both employees and external consultants to ensure that we meet, and exceed where possible, privacy expectations and requirements. Turnitin conducts periodic compliance reviews to verify that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, lawful, complete, implemented, and accessible. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy will be subjected to disciplinary action.</p>

<h5>Model Contract Clauses</h5>

<p>Where necessary, for data transfers outside the EEA, we utilise the Model Contractual Clauses. In each case, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data.</p>

<h5>Evolving Legislation</h5>

<p>Due to the ever-changing nature of legislation around data privacy, we reserve the right to make lawful changes as needed and recommend that you periodically check this Privacy Policy to see if there have been any new developments or changes. We continually look for ways to move toward more robust protection.</p>

<h4>2. Personal data</h4>
<p>Because we provide education services, we are vocal advocates for safeguarding student data and privacy and want to make sure that parents, educators, and schools know this, which is why we took the Student Privacy Pledge, put forth by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA).</p>

<h5>Data We Collect</h5>

<p>When an institution’s administrator or instructor creates an account with us, we ask for their personal data such as name, email, phone, and job title, so that we can correctly administer their account and provide them with the best customer service.</p>

<p>The type of information we request is connected to a specific purpose, namely to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Verify your identity and connection with a specific institution or company, to determine your eligibility to use our services or mobile application “Turnitin Feedback Studio”;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download content from our website, such as demos, whitepapers, or webcasts;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide receipt and confirmation of successful data uploads;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send important messages about our service, such as any changes to functionality;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send system emails, including account setup and password retrieval information, as well as digital receipts when you submit papers to the Turnitin Database; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide additional product and service support as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you use our services, the type of device you use and the version of your operating system is automatically collected. Turnitin collects information under the direction of its clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Turnitin works with its clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal data is collected.</p>

<h5>Putting You in Control</h5>

<p>We always give you the choice to opt out of email communication, with the exception of system emails, such as digital receipts and password reset information. In the context of processing student papers, Turnitin has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Turnitin acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. An individual who seeks access or would like to correct, amend, rectify or erase data, or should direct his/her query to the institution that is Turnitin’s customer (the ‘data controller’). If the customer requests that Turnitin erases the data, we will respond within 30 calendar days. If you are an individual user who has questions or would like to make changes to your personal data, please contact the institution through which you use our service.
Upon lawful request, Turnitin will provide information about any personal data we process. At any time, customers may access, correct, change completely or anonymize the personal data that you have provided us by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Log in to your account using your username and password;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the “User Info” link on the navigation bar to open your user profile and view or make changes to your personal data; OR</p>

    <p>For Gradescope, click the ‘Edit Account’ link under your Account menu; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have any trouble or would like for us to make changes for you, please email <a href="mailto:tiisupport@turnitin.com">tiisupport@turnitin.com</a> or, for Gradescope-related requests, <a href="mailto:help@gradescope.com">help@gradescope.com</a>. To honor a change request, we will need the exact information you want changed, as well as information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us. Our Customer Support can also provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal data. We respond to requests within 30 calendar days.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>Exceptional Circumstances</h5>

<p>We may disclose your personal data in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, or similar legal process or government request when we are required by law to do so. If Turnitin is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal data, and choices you may have regarding your personal data. We will only disclose your personal data to a third party with your prior consent.</p>

<h4>3. Tracking technologies</h4>

<h5>Cookies</h5>

<p>Turnitin and its partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about the user base as a whole. It does not use cookies for profiling. You can control whether or not cookies are allowed through your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, it may limit use of certain features or functions of our websites or service. To manage Flash Local Shared Objects (LSOs), which are sometimes called Flash cookies, please click here.</p>

<h5>Social Media Features &amp; Widgets</h5>

<p>Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the “Share This” widget, or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, record which pages you visit on our site, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features and widgets are sometimes hosted by a third party. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Pledge of the company providing the specific feature.</p>

<h5>Ads</h5>

<p>We do not serve ads on our site. We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.</p>

<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve site functionality.</p>

<h5>Blog</h5>

<p>Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal data from our blog or community forum, email us at <a href="mailto:tiisupport@turnitin.com">tiisupport@turnitin.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. You may also post a comment on our blog with the use of a third-party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third-party application if you want the personal data that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review their privacy policies.</p>

<h4>4. Choice</h4>
<p>We always give you the choice to opt out of email communication, with the exception of system emails, such as digital receipts and password reset information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us when we first request your personal data;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can opt out of receiving further communications by visiting our <a href="https://go.turnitin.com/preferences">email preferences page</a>; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can modify your personal data anytime by logging in to your account, selecting “User Info,” (“Edit Account” on Gradescope) and making changes as desired.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:tiisupport@turnitin.com">tiisupport@turnitin.com</a> and ask that we make changes on your behalf, but to honor your request, we will need the exact information you want changed, as well as information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us. Anytime you provide personal data to us, you determine whether or not we may disclose such information in a personally identifiable form to a third party or use it for purposes different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.</p>

<h4>5. Transfer to third parties</h4>
<p>Turnitin does not sell your personal data to third parties. Except in connection with the purposes for which it was originally collected, no personal data will be provided to a third party. If we transfer personal data to a third party, we will require that the third party agree to confidentiality requirements, and applicable legal requirements. We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to share your personal data with these companies, contact us by sending an email at <a href="mailto:tiisupport@turnitin.com">tiisupport@turnitin.com</a>.</p>

<p>Turnitin may transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our clients.
Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit personal data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.</p>

<h4>6. Security</h4>
<p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times. Our data is stored in the EU, USA and Canada with robust physical, digital, and procedural safeguards in place to protect your personal data, including the use of SSL encryption, redundant servers and data centers, and sophisticated perimeter security. We continuously audit for security vulnerabilities and make software patching a priority. Passwords are required to access your personal data, so please remember to keep your password confidential. Even with the tightest security systems, no one can guarantee protection from hackers and unauthorized third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>

<h5>Cyber Essentials</h5>

<p><em>(certified November 2019)</em></p>

<p>Cyber Essentials accredits a company’s IT infrastructure ensuring that its firewalls, secure configurations, user access control, malware protection, and patch management are of a high enough standard to protect any data within the company. Turnitin obtained the Cyber Essentials certification at the request of several international customers. Turnitin successfully completed a third-party audit of the effectiveness of our basic security controls.</p>

<h5>SOC 2 Compliance</h5>

<p>SOC2 is an audit of a company’s readiness to protect their user’s privacy and the security of their data. The company must show protections for both the data itself and the physical security of the locations it is stored. Turnitin obtained the SOC2 certification to demonstrate our commitment to security, privacy, and availability. To obtain this certification, over 160 controls aligned to the SOC2 criteria were designed for Turnitin and audited for effectiveness. Turnitin successfully satisfied 100% of the controls audited.</p>

<h4>7. Data Integrity</h4>
<p>We take every possible step to make sure that the personal data in our systems is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Turnitin will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client. We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may stop using the services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Turnitin when you stop using the Services. To request account deletion, please submit such a request directly to your academic institution, and an administrator will then make this request to us on your behalf. All requests from academic institutions must be made via email to <a href="mailto:tiisupport@turnitin.com">tiisupport@turnitin.com</a> for non-Gradescope accounts or <a href="mailto:help@gradescope.com">help@gradescope.com</a> for Gradescope accounts and are required to come from the email address registered to the administrator account.</p>

<p>The Turnitin database includes academic papers submitted by students and educators, as well as licensed source material sourced from the Internet. When a teacher wants to check a student paper for plagiarism, a coded engine compares it to other content in the database to check for matches. The software leaves all judgment about intellectual property up to the instructor. In the instance where a paper indicates a strong match to content submitted to another institution, instructors may find it necessary to request to view the matching paper. This request can either be accepted or denied by an institution. Any paper information must be passed from instructor to instructor via email, and therefore, outside of the Turnitin product.</p>

<p>You will at all times retain 100% ownership of your intellectual property rights. Turnitin does not ever assert or claim copyright ownership of any works submitted to or through our service. Your property is YOUR property. We do not, and will not, use your intellectual property for any purpose other than to deliver, support, and develop our services, which are designed to protect and strengthen your copyright.</p>

<h4>8. Changes to this policy</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check the Privacy Policy when you use the Site to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices. Our Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated. If at any point we decide to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via e-mail at the last email address you have provided to us. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. If you elect not to allow us to use your information in this different manner, we will continue to use such information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p>

<h4>9. Notices</h4>
<p>Please direct all inquiries regarding the Privacy Policy either to legal@turnitin.com or Turnitin, 2101 Webster St, Suite 1800, Oakland, California 94612.</p>

<h5>EU DATA PROTECTION COMPLIANCE</h5>

<p>We work with customers all over the world, and processing your personal data lawfully in order to earn your trust is our top priority. We understand that data protection is essential for good customer service. At Turnitin, our objective is to operate transparently, with accountability, and consistently with the EU and US regulatory environment so that our valued customers feel secure and in control.</p>

<p>Turnitin is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We will never sell your data;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will never use your data for targeted advertising/profiling;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices in SOC2 certified data centers;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we need to send any of your data to a third-party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Compliance Today</h5>

<p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers’ requirements.
Today, Turnitin uses Model Contractual Clauses to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection. These are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is adequately protected. This prevents our customers from having to request any additional authorization to use our service.
We are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed. For example, in the EU (including in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) we abide by Directive 95/46/EC to meet data protection requirements. The steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service involves data transfer to the United States (with the exception of Gradescope as used by certain Canadian, European, and Australian universities), and we recommend that consent is obtained from the student as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Universities are free to inspect or audit our services any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All student work and any associated personal data is encrypted and kept secure at all times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym or their student number and by submitting their work in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>General Data Protection Regulation</h5>

<p>The GDPR has legal effect in all EU Member States from 25 May 2018. The Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) has been replaced by the GDPR. Although it is a regulation and immediately effective in all EU Member States, there are certain regulations within the GDPR that Member States will be able to legislate upon at a national level for specific reasons, therefore this policy may change accordingly from time to time.</p>

<h5>The Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h5>

<p>Turnitin primarily relies upon Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR for its legal basis to process such data. Pursuant to this provision of GDPR, Turnitin relies upon the official authority of the Data Controller (the institution that is Turnitin’s customer) to process student data in such a way that anti-plagiarism checks may be made to satisfy the institution that the student’s work is their own.</p>

<p>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR also provides Turnitin with a lawful basis for processing. This is that it is in the legitimate interests of the Data Controller to process such data at their discretion.</p>

<p>Consent is not the primary basis for processing upon which Turnitin relies. However, the End-User Licence Agreement which Turnitin utilises with students will continue to be in place as a matter of best practice and transparency.</p>

<h5>Key Aspects of the GDPR</h5>

<p>The following are some notable aspects of the GDPR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The GDPR applies to all personal data processed;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GDPR makes it clear that when processing the personal data of EU nationals, data processors outside the EEA (including the US) must adhere to the GDPR and process only for lawful reasons;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GDPR requires much more accountability when processing personal data. Privacy must be embedded into everything (services, software, systems, and processes) by design and by default;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals’ rights have been strengthened; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To export data outside the EEA, EU Model Contractual Clauses will be favored, which Turnitin uses.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gdpr">EU Data Protection and GDPR Compliance</h2>

<p>We work with customers all over the world, and your trust is our top priority. We understand that data protection is essential for good customer service. At Turnitin, LLC, our objective is to operate transparently and consistently with the EU regulatory environment so that you, our valued customers, feel secure and in control.</p>

<p>Turnitin, LLC, which includes iThenticate and the Gradescope service, is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We will never sell your data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will never use your data for targeted advertising.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we need to send any of your data to a third party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Compliance today</h3>

<p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers’ requirements as data protection rules are reformed.</p>

<p>Today, Turnitin uses Model Clauses to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection. These are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is duly protected. This prevents our customers from having to request any additional authorization to use our service.</p>

<p>We are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed. The steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service involves data transfer to the United States (with the exception of Gradescope as used by certain Canadian universities), and we recommend that consent is obtained from the student as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Universities are free to inspect or audit our services any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All student work and any associated personal information is encrypted and kept secure at all times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym and by submitting papers in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming changes</h3>
<p>The 1995 laws that have been governing how personal data is protected in the EU were developed before smartphones and social media dominated our lives. For the past several years, negotiations have been underway to unify and simplify the laws and guidelines used to determine what obligations companies have to protect data crossing borders in the EU.</p>

<h3>EU data protection timeline</h3>
<p><strong>1995:</strong> The Data Protection Directive creates the framework for personal data protection laws in each of the EU Member States.</p>

<p><strong>2000:</strong> Safe Harbor decision to accommodate data transfers outside EU.</p>

<p><strong>2012:</strong> The European Commission proposes a draft of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p><strong>2014:</strong> The European Parliament votes on amended GDPR draft.</p>

<p><strong>2015:</strong> The European Council agrees on the final terms of GDPR. Safe Harbor is declared invalid.</p>

<p><strong>2016:</strong> Final GDPR version published. EU-US Privacy Shield becomes the new mechanism for transatlantic data transfers.</p>

<p><strong>2018:</strong> GDPR regulations take effect, repealing 95/46/EC.</p>

<p><strong>2020:</strong> The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into force.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-protection">Copyright Protection</h2>

<p>Turnitin agrees that students should own the copyright to their original work. A common misconception is that students relinquish their ownership rights when they submit work to Turnitin. This simply isn’t true!</p>

<p>Students who submit work to Turnitin retain the copyright to the work they created. For Turnitin services other than Gradescope, a copy of submitted papers is retained in a Turnitin database archive to be compared with future submissions - a practice that helps protect and strengthen copyright ownership. Student work that is submitted to Gradescope isn’t currently retained in the Turnitin source database, but this will change in the future with additional product integration.
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that archiving student papers to assess the originality of newly-submitted papers constitutes a fair use under the U.S. Copyright Act, provides “a substantial public benefit” and helps protect the papers from being exploited by others. <a href="https://go.turnitin.com/l/45292/2016-11-29/8vlz9r/45292/110034/Court_Opinion_on_Turnitin_031108_US_District_Court.pdf">Read the summary judgement.</a></p>

<p>The summary judgment was unanimously affirmed by a U.S. Court of Appeals. <a href="https://go.turnitin.com/l/45292/2016-11-29/8vlz9p/45292/110032/Court_Opinion_on_Turnitin_041609_US_Court_of_Appeals.pdf">Read the published decision.</a></p>

<h3>How does Turnitin protect my privacy?</h3>

<p>Turnitin is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users and their information. We maintain extremely high levels of privacy and security through the use of SSL encryption, redundant servers, sophisticated firewalls, multiple data centers, and privacy and security audits. With a security system that has never been breached and a student privacy pledge of the highest standards, instructors and students can use Turnitin with an unsurpassed level of confidence.</p>

<h3>Who owns student work once it is submitted to Turnitin?</h3>

<p>Students retain the copyright of work submitted to the Turnitin service, which includes the Gradescope service. The Turnitin user agreement entitles Turnitin to use the works as part of the plagiarism prevention system under the principles of fair use. Turnitin’s use of student papers under fair use was settled in a United States District Court of Law in 2007 and affirmed upon appeal in 2009.</p>

<p><a href="https://go.turnitin.com/l/45292/2016-11-29/8vlz9r/45292/110034/Court_Opinion_on_Turnitin_031108_US_District_Court.pdf">Read the 2007 summary judgement</a></p>

<h3>Does Turnitin archive student work?</h3>

<p>Turnitin archives student papers by default only for the purposes of textual comparison. Institutions may choose to not have their papers archived in the service.</p>

<p>The fair use defense codified in Section 107 of the Copyright Act has been recognized as an “equitable rule of reason.” In considering whether a use is a fair use, courts often analyze whether the use is beneficial to society as a whole (as part of a determination of whether a use is transformative) and whether the user has “clean hands.” The District Court and Fourth Circuit both held that the archiving of student works in the educational context is a fair use. In so holding, the courts did not find that Turnitin’s use of student works was in any respect unethical.</p>

<h3>How does Turnitin comply with privacy regulations of different countries?</h3>

<p>As a US company with high standards for security and privacy, Turnitin is designed to comply with many of the data protection requirements of other countries, including informed consent, access rights of submitting students, and technical and organizational measures to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.</p>

<h3>Am I bound to the Turnitin click-through agreement? What if I’m a minor?</h3>

<p>Yes. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found that the online click-through agreement on the Turnitin site is an enforceable agreement, even against minors. Parental consent or the consent of a guardian is required for a minor to set up an account with Turnitin and the agreement is therefore binding.</p>

<h3>Can a teacher compel me to submit my work to Turnitin if I attend private school? Public school?</h3>

<p>Yes in both cases.</p>

<p>If you attend a private school you have agreed to abide by the school’s policies.</p>

<p>With respect to public school, as the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has recognized in rejecting four students’ claim that they were improperly compelled to submit their papers to Turnitin or face a failing grade, “Schools have a right to decide how to monitor and address plagiarism in their schools and may employ companies like Turnitin to help do so.”</p>

<h3>Does Turnitin share information with third-party services?</h3>

<p>Turnitin integrates with third-party services such as the Educational Testing Service and Language Weaver where student information may be shared in order to deliver a part of these services. No personally identifiable information such as name, email or school is sent by Turnitin to third-party services for purposes other than the provision of the Turnitin services.</p>

<h3>Does Turnitin comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)?</h3>

<p>Yes. The Turnitin service is compliant with and helps institutions comply with FERPA, including:
Turnitin expects and suggests that institutions comply with FERPA’s notice requirements regarding the use and disclosure of directory and non-directory education records so that students and parents are aware that the school may engage services like Turnitin.</p>

<p>Institutions are free to inspect or audit our services to assure themselves that all information is used only for the purposes of assisting instructors.</p>

<p>Data is kept secure at all times and are only used for purposes of assisting the instructor in assessing the assignment.
Users may submit their paper using a pseudonym and in formats that contain little, if any, identifying metadata. This reduces our chance of collecting and processing personal data.</p>

<h3>Does Turnitin comply with COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection Act)?</h3>

<p>Under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), consistent with the position of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), we rely on our education institution customers to obtain the necessary parental consents prior to collecting only the minimally required personal information from students under age 13. As with all the students we serve, any such information is used only for providing the services to the educational institutions. We comply with all COPPA requirements, and partner with our education institution customers to ensure that parents are always able to exercise their rights under all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Who can I contact at Turnitin if I have privacy concerns?</h3>

<p>We are always ready to answer any question or concerns you may have. Please write to us at <a href="mailto:legal@turnitin.com">legal@turnitin.com.</a></p>
