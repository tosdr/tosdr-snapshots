<h4 id="what-is-the-legal-basis-for-and-purpose-of-the-processing-of-personal-data"><strong>What is the legal basis for and purpose of the processing of personal data?</strong></h4>

<p>The basis of processing personal data is Open Badge Factory’s justified interest on the basis of a customer relationship or implementing a contract with the data subject, as well as consent as regards direct marketing.</p>

<p>The basis of processing personal data is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the delivery and development of our Open Badge Passport Service (“Service”),</li>
  <li>fulfilling our contractual and other promises and obligations,</li>
  <li>taking care of the customer relationship,</li>
  <li>analysing and profiling behaviour of the data subject,</li>
  <li>electronic and direct marketing,</li>
  <li>targeting advertising in our and others´ online services</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-data-do-we-process"><strong>What data do we process</strong></h4>

<p>We process the following personal data of you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic information of the data subject such as name<em>, country</em>, language<em>, user name</em>, password*;</li>
  <li>Contact information of the data subject e-mail address*, phone number, address, city, state;</li>
  <li>Information of  the service relationship and the contract such as details of the open badge(s) granted to the data subject, details of the user profile, correspondence with the data subject and other references, cookies and data related to use of them;</li>
  <li>Other voluntary information provided by the data subject into the Service such as personal introduction in the Service, links to social media accounts (such as Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, blogs etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>Committing personal data marked with a star as well as allowing the use of cookies in the service user’s browser, is a requirement for our contractual relationship with the data subject. Without this necessary information we are not able to provide the Service.</p>

<h4 id="from-where-do-we-receive-data"><strong>From where do we receive data?</strong></h4>

<p>We receive the above mentioned personal data primarily from the data subject him/herself, as the data is entered into the Service by the data subject.</p>

<p>We receive the data subject’s e-mail address to which we send the granted Open Badge from our customer (as the data controller). We act as the data processor in this relationship.</p>

<p>For the purposes described in this privacy notice, personal data may also be collected and updated from publicly available sources and based on information received from authorities or other third parties within the limits of the applicable laws and regulations. Data updating of this kind is performed manually or by automated means.</p>

<p>The data subject may at any time add, change and remove all his/her data from the Service as well as delete his/her account entirely. The deletion of the account will erase all the data subject’s data from Service.</p>
