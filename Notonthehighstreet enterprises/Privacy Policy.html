Any order placed is deemed to be an instruction from you to share your personal data in this way. The Seller will act as an independent data controller, on a stand-alone basis, and process your personal data in accordance with their own policies and security measures. We are not responsible for protecting your information when it is under their control, but you may exercise against such Seller all of the rights which you would otherwise be able to exercise against us as set out in this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><p>When we share your personal data with a Seller, you should be aware of the following:</p><ul><li>The Seller (name and contact details) will be as identified on our site.

It usually comprises Financial Data or Transaction Data. This happens when we link through to third party payment providers. They tell us that you have paid for your products and, where relevant and/or necessary they will provide us with your Contact Data and Transaction Data. We also might engage third party contractors to provide us with technical or delivery services that are related to your account with us.</li><li>Data Enrichment Providers: We may share limited data with trusted data enrichment providers to help us to make sure that the data we store about you is accurate and to help us improve our offering to our customers by understanding you better. This is in our legitimate interests.</li><li>Customer reward providers: We use RewardsBag Ltd also known as Delight, registered Suffolk House, George Street, Croydon, Surrey, United Kingdom, CR0 0YN for the purposes of providing customer rewards. RewardsBag uses sendgrid to send emails to customers with the reward they have requested. RewardsBag is registered as a data processor,<a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZB601820">ZB601820</a><span></span></li><li>Professional Advisers and Investors: We may also share your data with professional advisers such as our lawyers and insurers to manage risks and legal claims, and/or as part of our relationship and obligations to our investor organisations. This is in our legitimate interests.</li><li>Group: It is possible we could sell our business to a third party or re-organise our business or become insolvent. In that scenario, our database of customers is one of the biggest parts of our business and so we would need to share it with the third-party buyer and their advisers. This is in the legitimate interests of selling our business. We may also expand our group of companies and in this scenario we may share your data within our group in order to improve our products and services and because some of our internal support services may be shared across the group. This is in our legitimate interests of cost efficiency and growing our business. Where this occurs, we will post a link to all group companies and their locations in this Privacy Policy and they will use your data in the ways set out in this Policy.</li><li>Law Enforcement/Legal Compliance: We will cooperate with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We will also cooperate with law enforcement requests from within or outside your country of residence. This may include disclosing your personal information to government or law enforcement agencies, or private parties, when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is required by law or when we, in our discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, fraud reduction or legal process served on us. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. These uses of your data are in our legitimate interests of protecting our business security. We may also use your data and share it with the recipients listed in this Privacy Policy for the purpose of complying with our legal obligations.</li></ul><p>The lawful bases for sharing and processing this data are set out in the <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/privacy#data_purposes" target="_self">table below</a> and please refer to the <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/third-parties" target="_self">List of Third Party Providers </a>for further information.</p><p>5.

For example, we may classify an appropriate audience for a promotion by what products on our website you have previously looked at or expressed an interest in.</p><p>MARKETING</p><p>We may use your data (collected directly or from third parties) to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.</p><p>We do not track what other websites you may visit after visiting our site, though in common with most websites, we may register the site which referred you to our site (e.g. a search engine or a third party website which has our website linked in it).</p><p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p><p>We generally only send electronic marketing - such as email marketing - to people who have previously bought similar products from us and this is in our legitimate interests. We will always offer a way out of receiving this marketing when you first purchase our products and in every marketing communication afterwards. We may on occasion send out postal marketing for the purpose of growing our sales which is in our legitimate interests and in this scenario we will rely on you to let us know if you do not want to receive this by opting out of marketing (see Opting Out below).</p><p>If you have an account with us, and purchase a product through PayPal Express, we will not recognise you as an existing customer (including for the purposes of your marketing preferences) until you have completed your purchase, and if you provide us with the same email address as the one registered to your account.</p><p>Where you have not previously bought from us but have registered your details with us (for example by entering a competition or signing up for a newsletter), we will only send you direct marketing communications if you opted into receiving marketing at the time and so given us your express consent (which you may withdraw at any time – see Opting Out below).<br/><span>We may also send text message marketing if you have expressly consented to receive such messages. You can opt out of receiving these messages at any time - see Opting Out below.</span></p><p>We may also share certain data (for example, email addresses, age, as well as other segmentation data provided by third parties) with other advertising platforms (or third parties which facilitate advertising) in order to show you targeted ads including on social media, search engine or video streaming platforms whether or not you opt in to direct marketing. We do this by:</p><ol><li>the use of cookies which capture your visits to our website. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/cookies" target="_self">Cookies Policy</a> for more information; and</li><li>we may also provide these advertising platforms (or third parties which facilitate advertising) with personal data e.g. your email address, age, as well as other segmentation data provided by third parties to create ‘audiences’ of users fitting within a certain demographic/category so that we can target our marketing. This is in our legitimate interests. See ‘Opting Out’ below for details of how you can opt out of this. Our <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/cookies" target="_self">Cookies Policy</a> also explains how you can adjust your cookies preferences.</li></ol><p>If you use our Notonthehighstreet: Shop Gifts app, you may receive push notifications from us if you have opted in to receive them. You can choose to turn these off at any time through your relevant device.</p><p>EVENT REMINDERS</p><p>We may send you marketing messages to remind you of an event where you have opted into receiving reminders and so given us your express consent (which you may withdraw at any time - see Opting Out below).</p><p>OPTING OUT</p><p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages (including event reminders) at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/user/communication-preferences" target="_self">marketing preferences</a>, by following the opt-out links on any direct marketing message sent to you or by <a href="https://info.notonthehighstreet.com/hc/en-us/articles/207113987-How-do-I-contact-you-" target="_self">contacting us</a> at any time.</p><p>If you opt out of receiving email marketing from us, we will continue to share limited personal data with other advertising platforms (or facilitators of advertising platforms) (see <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/third-parties" target="_self">List of Third Party Providers</a>) unless you make a request for us to erase your personal data (see Section 10 - Your Legal Rights below). Please check the social media, search engine or video streaming platforms&#x27; terms for more detail of how to opt out from seeing these ads.</p><p>Where you opt out of receiving marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, or related correspondence, and we will continue to process such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and only ever as permitted by law.</p><p>COOKIES</p><p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/cookies" target="_self">Cookies Policy</a>.</p><p>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</p><p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p><p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p><p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p><p>THIRD PARTIES</p><p>When you place an order on our website, that information will also be received by the relevant Seller on our marketplace so that they can process and deliver your order. We may also pass on any information about your order or query to a Seller, where relevant.</p><p>We also use other third parties to process your personal data and these change from time to time. Please review the <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/third-parties" target="_self">List of Third Party Providers</a> regularly to ensure that you are informed.</p><p>6. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p><p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and they may only use your data for the purposes we specify in our contract with them. We will always work with them to protect your privacy.</p><p>7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</p><p>Some Sellers, and third parties that we use, are based outside the United Kingdom, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the United Kingdom.</p><p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the United Kingdom, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p><ul><li>We will only transfer your personal data to EU member states and EEA countries on the basis that, on a transitional basis, the United Kingdom deems EU member states and EEA countries to be adequate to allow for data flows from the United Kingdom. </li><li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or the Information Commissioners Office. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_self">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a> or  <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/sccs-after-transition-period/" target="_self">https://ico.org.uk/for-organis...</a></li><li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or the UK. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_self">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</li></ul><p>8. DATA SECURITY</p><p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p><p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><p>You acknowledge that the Internet is not a completely secure medium for communication and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to us (or we send to you) via the Internet. We are not responsible for any damages which you, or others, may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of such information</p><p>9. DATA RETENTION</p><p>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</p><p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, details of your orders will be kept for as long as we need to retain that data to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements. </p><p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/privacy#legal_rights" target="_self">‘Your Legal Rights’</a> below for further information.</p><p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><p>10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</p><p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p><p>You have the right to:</p><ul><li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li><li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li><li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. For example where you consider that we do not need it any longer for the purposes for which we originally collected it as explained to you in this Privacy Policy, where you have withdrawn your consent to our using it and we had relied on that consent according to this Policy, where you consider that we cannot show a ‘legitimate interest’ in continuing to process it and we have relied on that legitimate interest to process it as explained to you in this Policy. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li><li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes or targeted advertising. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li><li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li><li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li><li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</li></ul><p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please <a href="https://info.notonthehighstreet.com/hc/en-us/articles/207113987-How-do-I-contact-you-" target="_self">Contact Us</a>, marking your query for the attention of the DPO.</p><p>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</p><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</p><p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><p>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</p><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><p>11. LIMITED JOINT CONTROLLER RELATIONSHIP WITH AWIN</p><p>Notonthehighstreet processes your personal data in order to operate affiliate marketing campaigns. This enables us to understand which third party operators of websites, apps and other technology have referred potential customers to our websites and apps, and allows us to pay them a commission in return for those referrals. We do this in the pursuit of our legitimate interests of carrying on an online advertising campaign, paid for on a performance basis. We work with Awin, which helps us to carry out these affiliate marketing campaigns. You can find the Awin privacy policy at <a href="https://www.awin.com/gb/privacy/" target="_self">https://www.awin.com/gb/privacy/</a>, which includes information on your rights in respect of their data processing. In some instances, Awin may maintain a limited profile which relates to you, but which does not reveal your identity, online behaviour or other personal characteristics. This profile is only used to understand whether a referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device. In some cases, Awin and the referrers of potential customers may receive and process your personal data for the purposes of carrying out affiliate marketing campaigns with us. We also receive personal data from Awin and the referrers of potential customers, which can be categorised as: cookie data, data relating to the website, app or other technology from which a potential customer was referred and technical information relating to your device or an ID individually assigned to your transaction, which Awin can assign to the aforementioned data in its system.</p><p>12. GLOSSARY</p><p>A more detailed explanation on what some references mean in this policy is as follows:</p><p>“legitimate interest” means our interest in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).</p><p>“performance of a contract” means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p><p>“comply with a legal or regulatory obligation” means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p><p><strong>Last updated: 15 December 2023</strong></p></div></div></div></section></div></div></main><div class="" data-testid="scoped-base-styles-wrapper"><footer><section

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou acknowledge that the Internet is not a completely secure medium for communication and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to us (or we send to you) via the Internet.

For example, details of your orders will be kept for as long as we need to retain that data to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/about/privacy#legal_rights\" target=\"_self\"\u003e‘Your Legal Rights’\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;below for further information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have the right to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequest access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequest correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequest erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. For example where you consider that we do not need it any longer for the purposes for which we originally collected it as explained to you in this Privacy Policy, where you have withdrawn your consent to our using it and we had relied on that consent according to this Policy, where you consider that we cannot show a ‘legitimate interest’ in continuing to process it and we have relied on that legitimate interest to process it as explained to you in this Policy. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eObject to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes or targeted advertising. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequest restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you wish to exercise any of these rights, please\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://info.notonthehighstreet.com/hc/en-us/articles/207113987-How-do-I-contact-you-\" target=\"_self\"\u003eContact Us\u003c/a\u003e, marking your query for the attention of the DPO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIME LIMIT TO RESPOND\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.

LIMITED JOINT CONTROLLER RELATIONSHIP WITH AWIN\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotonthehighstreet processes your personal data in order to operate affiliate marketing campaigns. This enables us to understand which third party operators of websites, apps and other technology have referred potential customers to our websites and apps, and allows us to pay them a commission in return for those referrals. We do this in the pursuit of our legitimate interests of carrying on an online advertising campaign, paid for on a performance basis. We work with Awin, which helps us to carry out these affiliate marketing campaigns. You can find the Awin privacy policy at \u003ca href=\"https://www.awin.com/gb/privacy/\" target=\"_self\"\u003ehttps://www.awin.com/gb/privacy/\u003c/a\u003e, which includes information on your rights in respect of their data processing. In some instances, Awin may maintain a limited profile which relates to you, but which does not reveal your identity, online behaviour or other personal characteristics. This profile is only used to understand whether a referral is commenced on one device and completed on another device. In some cases, Awin and the referrers of potential customers may receive and process your personal data for the purposes of carrying out affiliate marketing campaigns with us. We also receive personal data from Awin and the referrers of potential customers, which can be categorised as: cookie data, data relating to the website, app or other technology from which a potential customer was referred and technical information relating to your device or an ID individually assigned to your transaction, which Awin can assign to the aforementioned data in its system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12.

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“performance of a contract” means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request
