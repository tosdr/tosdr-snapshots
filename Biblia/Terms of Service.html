          <li>your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or in King County, State of Washington, U.S.A., if you reside outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the notice of copyright infringement or an agent of such person.</li>

    <dd>
      <p><strong>Fees.</strong> You agree to pay fees for the Services you order on any Faithlife website when you select a Service, typically by placing an Order, or that are otherwise communicated to you in writing ("Fees"). Fees are denominated and payable in United States dollars. All Fees paid are nonrefundable. All Fees are payable by credit card or other means of payment as authorized by Faithlife as further described below. </p>
      <p><strong>Surcharges.</strong> Fees are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, import or export taxes, duties, value-added taxes, tariffs or similar surcharges (“Surcharges”). In the event Faithlife is required by law to withhold Surcharges on your behalf, Faithlife may pay such Surcharges to the authorized taxing authority and, upon demand, you agree to reimburse Faithlife for amounts paid.</p>
      <p><strong>Collection.</strong> You agree to reimburse Faithlife for any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred to collect any Fees or Surcharges not paid when due.</p>
      <p><strong>Payment Processing.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Faithlife uses a third-party payment processor for all credit card transactions. Payments made via credit card are subject to the terms and conditions of such payment processors, <!--a link to which is provided in the FAQ at <a href="/faq">www.faithlife.com</a>,--> as well as the terms of your own banking institution or credit card provider. You hereby authorize Faithlife and its third-party payment processing provider to charge your credit card for all applicable Fees. You agree to provide us with accurate and timely credit card information. In the event that we are unable to charge Fees to the credit card provided, and you do not provide us with another valid credit card prior to the date on which you are due to be charged, then your ability to access and use the Services will be suspended or terminated in Faithlife’s sole discretion.</p>
      <p><strong>Suspension.</strong> Fees payable to Faithlife shall continue to accrue during any period of Service suspension. Amounts due must be paid in full as a condition precedent to Service reactivation, which reactivation will be in Faithlife’s sole discretion.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><h2 id="18"><strong>18. Subscriptions.</strong></h2></dt>
    <dd>
      <p><strong>Payment for Subscriptions.</strong> Faithlife offers a variety of paid and non-paid Subscriptions for Services. Please see specific product pricing pages for pricing information.</p>
      <p>All Subscriptions begin when we confirm your initial payment and renew thereafter on an automatic basis as described in your Order (e.g. monthly, semi-annually, annually, biennially or on some other basis). By subscribing, you agree to allow us to automatically renew your Subscription at the end of each Subscription period. Your Subscription will automatically renew on the renewal date shown in the “Subscriptions” section of your account page unless the Subscription is no longer offered. On the renewal date, the payment method associated with your account will be charged the then current rate for the Subscription (or the monthly portion due if you have an annual Subscription that is billed monthly).</p>
      <p>We will do our best to provide notice of any changes to service terms or price at the time of the change. If a renewal payment fails, you will be notified via email. You will have 13 days to update your payment information before your Subscription will be suspended. <strong>All notices regarding your Subscription will be sent to the email address associated with your account. It is up to you to keep that email address current.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Free trials.</strong> Your Subscription may start with a free trial for a limited period of time. When combining free trials with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and certain former subscribers only. We reserve the right to determine your free-trial eligibility. Some free trials will not allow auto-renewal. To continue service on free trials without automatic renewal, you will need to subscribe and have an active payment method on file on your account. Some free trials will be subject to auto-renewal, and require a payment method to be on file at the time the trial starts. In these instances we will begin billing you for your Subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless you cancel automatic renewal (see Cancellation/Termination) prior to the end of the free-trial period. Please keep a record of when your free-trial period ends. You are responsible for canceling the automatic renewal of your Subscription in a timely manner.</p>
      <p><strong>How to manage your Subscription.</strong> You can view billing cycle information, manage your Subscription by visiting “Subscriptions” on your account page (<a href="https://store.faithlife.com/account/subscriptions">store.faithlife.com/account/Subscriptions</a>).  Contact numbers for the Company can be found at <a href="https://faithlife.com/contact">www.faithlife.com</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Cancellation/Termination.</strong> To cancel your Subscription you must click “Cancel Subscription” from the "Subscriptions" section of your account page and follow the instructions given. Once you’ve done this, your Subscription will not automatically renew at the next renewal date. If you cancel an annual subscription that is being billed monthly, your payment method will be charged for the remaining payments due on the established billing cycle. You will have full access to the Services subject to the Subscription until the end of your existing subscription term. </p>

    <dt><h2 id="22"><strong>22. Compulsory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong></h2></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and unappealable. The arbitration shall be conducted in Seattle, Washington, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Faithlife may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect our intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>If either Faithlife or you want to arbitrate a dispute, Faithlife and you each agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the dispute, previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documents/information, and the proposed resolution. Notice to you will be sent to the billing address that you have provided us and notice to us will be sent to: 1313 Commercial Street, Bellingham, WA 98226.  Faithlife and you each agree to make attempts to resolve this dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate. Thereafter, either Faithlife or you may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.</p>
      <p>Both you and Faithlife each agree not to pursue arbitration on a consolidated or classwide basis. Both you and Faithlife each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Faithlife (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction in unconscionable or unenforceable, then this agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the dispute must be brought in court.</p>
      <p>NO CLASS ACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CONSOLIDATED OR CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
      <p>NO TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
      <p>YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS SET FORTH ABOVE BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO <a href="mailto:security@faithlife.com">[SECURITY@FAITHLIFE.COM]</a> LETTING US KNOW THAT YOU ARE OPTING OUT BY CONTACTING US WITH THE SUBJECT LINE, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT" WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR FIRST USE OF ANY FAITHLIFE SERVICES, OR WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FIRST TERMS OF USE CONTAINING AN ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION, WHICHEVER IS LATER. OTHERWISE, YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE. IF YOU OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THEM EITHER WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTES WITH YOU.</p>
