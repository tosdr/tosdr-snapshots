To stay focused on improving our Service and empowering our Members to create change, WhatRocks may engage third-party service providers that are not affiliated with WhatRocks to manage your wallets. Accordingly, WhatRocks expressly disclaims responsibility and liability for all service provided by any service provider, and you agree that WhatRocks will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of those service.s When you create your Corporate Account, you agree to their terms and applicable fees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may credit your Fiat Wallet with fiat currency in view of purchasing Digital Tokens you will distribute as financial rewards to Individuals who see or click on your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material. The purchased Digital Tokens are then credited to your Wallet for you to use as financial rewards to Individuals who are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material. You are not allowed to sell, exchange, transfer or lend Digital Tokens. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Account information</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You will be able to see the available balance of Digital Tokens in your Wallet as well as your Transaction history, including (1) the number of Digital Tokens purchased, (2) the applicable rate of exchange in fiat currency, (3) the corresponding amount in fiat currency, (4) a reference to the identity of your Corporation’s representative who placed each buy order of Digital Tokens, and (5) the date of each Transaction.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Transactions</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Buying Digital Tokens</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Digital Tokens purchases and sales on the marketplace are collectively referred to herein as “<strong>Trading Transactions</strong>”.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can load funds into your Fiat Wallet from a valid bank account via ACH transfer or wire transfer. Your fiat balance is in a pending state and will not be credited to your Fiat Wallet until after the bank transfer has cleared, usually with 5 business days. We may debit your  bank account linked with your WhatRocks Account as soon as you initiate payment. The name on your linked bank account and your wire transfer must match the name verified on your Corporate Account.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you buy Digital Tokens on the Service, you are buying from WhatRocks on the primary market or from Charities on the secondary market. WhatRocks provides the blockchain infrastructure to facilitate that purchase between you, WhatRocks and Charities. WhatRocks does not act as the agent that transacts on your behalf.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may buy Digital Tokens using (a) funds in your Fiat Wallet, or (b) a valid bank account in the name that matches the name on your Corporate Account (each a "<strong>Valid Payment Method</strong>"). Your purchase must follow the relevant instructions in the Service. A purchase of Digital Tokens using a Valid Payment Method generally will initiate on the business day we receive your instructions. Purchased Digital Tokens will be deposited in your Wallet as soon as funds have settled to WhatRocks or the Charities, which in the case of a bank account may take up to five business days. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your buy orders of Digital Tokens are pending on the marketplace until the corresponding amount in fiat currency is credited to your Fiat Wallet. Although Digital Tokens have a fixed value, WhatRocks may change the applicable exchange rate in fiat currency from time to time to adjust to the market value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Once your payment in fiat currency is received on your Fiat Wallet, your buy orders are then placed on the Marketplace to be matched in priority with sell orders from Charities on the secondary market. You cannot withdraw or cancel buy orders that are placed in the Marketplace: buy orders are non-cancellable, non-exchangeable, non-refundable, non-transferable, irrevocable, and non-reversible. Once your payment in fiat currency is received on the Charities’ Fiat Wallet, their Digital Tokens are transferred to your Corporation’s Wallet. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Should the supply of Digital Tokens represented by the sell orders available on the secondary market be insufficient to meet your demand of Digital Tokens, your unmet demand of Digital Tokens is automatically directed to the primary market where WhatRocks may issue and sell the requested Digital Tokens to the complete your buy order. Your buy order will therefore always find a counterparty for your Trading Transaction, regardless of your order size.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When a Trading Transaction occurs using your credentials, we will assume in good faith that you authorized such Trading Transaction. It is important that you regularly check your Fiat Wallet and Wallet balances and your Trading Transaction history regularly. We are not responsible for any claim for unauthorized or incorrect Trading Transactions. You are fully and solely responsible for all purchases of Digital Tokens that occur under your WhatRocks Account.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If your Trading Transaction cannot be completed for any reason (such as price movement, or market latency), the marketplace will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. You will not be charged for a rejected Trading Transaction.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You understand and acknowledge that payments made to WhatRocks or to Charities are not tax-deductible as charitable donations. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may use your Digital Tokens exclusively to (1) reward Individuals financially when they are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material, or (2) to make donations to Charities or Fundraisers.

You should consult your tax advisor as to the eligibility for any tax break and to the amount of your donation that is tax deductible or eligible for tax recognition, having regard to (among other things) the tax status of the recipient of any donation in any relevant jurisdiction, and particularly if you are awarded a gift or prize in connection with your donation.

You are not allowed to exchange, transfer or lend Digital Tokens. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Account information</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You will be able to see the available balance of Digital Tokens in your Wallet as well as your Transaction history, including (1) the number of Digital Tokens received, (2) the applicable rate of exchange in fiat currency, (3) the corresponding amount in fiat currency, (4) a reference to the identity of your entity’s representative who placed each sell order, and (5) the date of each Transaction.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Transactions</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Receiving donations in Digital Tokens</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a Charity, you may receive donations from Individuals and Corporations. Donations to your Charity are final, irrevocable, non-refundable, non-cancellable, non-reversible, non-exchangeable and unrestricted (ie you may redeem your Digital Tokens for any fiat currency or cryptocurrency and use the monies received in return for any purpose).</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Selling Digital Tokens</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Digital Tokens purchases and sales on the marketplace are collectively referred to herein as “<strong>Trading Transactions</strong>”.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you sell Digital Tokens on the Service, you are selling to Corporations on the secondary market, not to WhatRocks. WhatRocks merely provides a blockchain infrastructure that facilitates that Trading Transaction between you and Corporations. WhatRocks does not act as the agent that transacts on your behalf.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can sell Digital Tokens and instruct the Service to deposit funds into your Fiat Wallet. If your Trading Transaction cannot be completed for any reason (such as price movement, market latency, inability to find a counterparty for your transaction, or order size), the marketplace will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. You will not be charged for a rejected Trading Transaction.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may place sell orders on the secondary market to get fiat currency in exchange of your Digital Tokens. Although Digital Tokens have a fixed value, WhatRocks may change the applicable exchange rate in fiat currency from time to time to adjust to the market value of the underlying cryptocurrency.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Should the demand of Digital Tokens represented by the buy orders from Corporations available on the secondary market be insufficient to meet your supply of Digital Tokens, your unsold Digital Tokens remain on your Wallet. While the Digital Tokens that you successfully sold are transferred to the buying Corporations’ Wallet, your Fiat Wallet gets credited with the corresponding amount in fiat currency.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You cannot withdraw or cancel sell orders that are placed in the marketplace: sell orders are non-cancellable, non-exchangeable, non-refundable, non-transferable, irrevocable, and non-reversible.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Blockchain fees</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Donations are received minus any applicable blockchain fees that apply on each Transaction. WhatRocks may change these blockchain fees from time to time to adjust to the fees charged by the underlying software protocols.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ownership of donor lists and data </h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Donor Data” shall mean a Donor’s name, address, email address, donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number, name of the Charity, name of the Fundraiser, and name of the Item associated with the Donation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>PURSUANT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY AND UNLESS INDIVIDUALS EXPLICTLY AND FORMALLY CONSENT OTHERWISE, THE LIST OF DONORS WHO MAKE A DONATION TO A CHARITY, CONTRIBUTE TO A FUNDRAISER, OR PURCHASE GIVEBACK ITEMS THROUGH THE SERVICE (“DONOR LISTS”) AND THE DONOR DATA ARE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND ARE NOT SHARED WITH CHARITIES OR MERCHANTS.</strong></p>

The parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the dispute that is satisfactory to all parties.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the WhatRocks support team, you and we agree to use the Formal Complaint Process set forth below.</strong>&nbsp;You agree to use this process before filing any arbitration claim or small claims action. If you do not follow the procedures set out in this Section before filing an arbitration claim or suit in small claims court, we shall have the right to ask the arbitrator or small claims court to dismiss your filing unless and until you complete the following steps.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Procedural steps</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the event that your dispute with WhatRocks or a Member is not resolved through your contact with WhatRocks Support, you agree to use our Complaint form to describe your Complaint, how you would like us to resolve the Complaint, and any other information related to your dispute that you believe to be relevant. The Complaint form will be provided to you by WhatRocks Support.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>WhatRocks response</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We will acknowledge receipt of your Complaint form after you submit it. A WhatRocks customer relations agent ("Agent") will review your Complaint. The Agent will evaluate your Complaint based on the information you have provided and information in the possession of WhatRocks. Within 15 business days of our receipt of your Complaint form, the Agent will address the issues raised in your Complaint form by sending you an e-mail ("Resolution Notice") in which the Agent will: (i) offer to resolve your complaint in the way you requested; (ii) make a determination rejecting your Complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection; or (iii) offer to resolve your Complaint with an alternative solution. In exceptional circumstances, if the Agent is unable to respond to your Complaint within 30 business days for reasons beyond WhatRocks’ control, the Agent will send you a communication indicating the reasons for any delay in answering your Complaint, and specifying the deadline by which the Agent will respond to your Complaint, which will be no later than 60 business days from our receipt of your Complaint form.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Arbitration, waiver of class action</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If we cannot resolve the dispute through the Formal Complaint Process, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the WhatRocks Service, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the “Arbitration Agreement”). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Canadian Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes. </strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>This Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WHATROCKS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce these Terms, any arbitration pursuant to these Terms, or any small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.</p>
