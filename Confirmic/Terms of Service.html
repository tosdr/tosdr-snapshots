We recommend that you print a copy of this for future reference.</p><p>By using the Services, you are confirming that you accept these Terms of Service and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you must not use the Services.</p><p><em>Other applicable terms</em><br/> These Terms of Service refer to the following additional terms, which also apply to your use of the Services.</p><p>Our Privacy Policy, which sets out the terms on which we process any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us.</p><p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br/> Confirmic Limited (“Confirmic”, “us”, “our” or “we”) is the provider of the Services and operator of the Platform. We are registered in England and Wales under company number 11400246 and have our registered office at Confirmic Limited of 86-90 Paul Street, 3rd Floor, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 4NE. Our VAT number is 308887855.</p><p><strong>2. Changes to these terms</strong><br/> We may revise these Terms of Service at any time by amending this page. Where appropriate (for example, where the changes limit your rights or increase your obligations), we will also give you notice of the changes by sending you an email – where possible, a reasonable time in advance. The process for changes to fees and payment plans is set out separately in clause 8.</p><p>Please check this page from time to time and give careful consideration to any emails we send you, as the changes to the Terms of Service will be binding on you.</p><p><strong>3. User account</strong><br/> If you register for an account on the Platform (including via third party authentication), you are responsible for any use of our Services with your account details, and for protecting your account details from unauthorised use. You are also responsible for the security of any computer from which you sign in to your account.</p><p>In the case of a company, you hereby warrant that you have authority to bind the company (as the contracting party) to these Terms of Service. In the case of an individual, you hereby warrant that you are 18 years of age or older or, where you are not, that you have the consent of your parent or guardian to use the Services in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>4. Rights we grant you</strong><br/> We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to install and make use of the Services and to make use of the documentation available at https://docs.confirmic.com/ (“Documentation”) and Service Data, solely for your internal business operations and in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p><p>This licence shall remain in effect until and unless these Terms of Service are terminated by you or us (see clause 10 for information about termination). You promise and agree that you will only make use of the Services, Documentation and Service Data within the scope of this licence and limits, terms and conditions set out in these Terms of Service, and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Services, Documentation or Service Data, or any part of them.</p><p>You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Services, the Documentation, the Service Data and the Platform anywhere in the world belong to us or our licensors (even after installation onto a computer owned by you or integration into your system), and that you have no rights in or to the Services, Documentation, Service Data or the Platform other than the right to use each of them in accordance with the terms of these Terms of Service.</p><p>In the event that you breach the terms of the licence granted to you herein and such breach results in the creation of derivative works of the Services, the Documentation, and/or the Service Data (“Improvements”), you hereby assign with full title guarantee all such Improvements to us. Such assignment does not preclude us from taking any legal or other action against you for contravention of these terms and conditions, including for infringement of our intellectual property rights.</p><p><strong>5. Services</strong><br/> From time to time, we may introduce new services, features or functionality to the Services. These Terms of Service will apply to such new services, features or functionality, unless they come with separate or additional terms, in which case you will be required to agree to such separate or additional terms before being permitted to use the new services, features or functionality.</p><p>We undertake that the Services will be performed substantially in accordance with the Documentation and with reasonable skill and care. This undertaking shall not apply to the extent of any non-conformance which is caused by your use of the Services contrary to our instructions or these Terms of Service, or any alternation or modification made to the Services or the software used in the provision of the Services by a third party who is not authorised by us. You understand and agree that we have no obligation to modify software to support your use of the Services.</p><p>We do not warrant that:<br/> • the Services will be able to find all data privacy vulnerabilities on your website, nor be able to restrict all forms of non-consensual access to your customers’ data. You are responsible for the installation, integration and implementation of our Services on your website(s); or<br/> • a patch will not break the functionality of your code or will not result in the introduction of new data privacy vulnerabilities. We take care when authoring patches and test all patches before making them available to you as part of the Services; however, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to assess the impact of a patch before using it.</p><p>You further acknowledge that the suggestions made by us in relation to fixes (whether for updates, patches or monitoring services) are provided for general information only, and have not been made with your particular requirements in mind. It is therefore not intended to amount to advice on which you should solely rely.</p><p><strong>6. Accessing the Services</strong><br/> You acknowledge that the extent of your use of the Services will depend on your subscription plan, and you further agree to only use the Services within the limits of such subscription plan. The default subscription plan is the ‘Free Plan’. Details about the Services available under each subscription plan can be found here: /pricing/. If, at any time whilst using the Services, you exceed the limit of your subscription plan, we will charge you, and you will pay, the relevant fees which apply to such excess use as set out above. We will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you when the limit is close to being exceeded; however, we accept no liability for failure to do this. You are solely responsible for monitoring your use of the Services within the permitted limits.</p><p>Whilst we will make reasonable efforts to ensure the Services are operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, we do not guarantee that the Services will always be available or be uninterrupted. In particular, but without limitation:</p><p><em>Maintenance Services:</em> The Services will not be available to you when we carry out maintenance services. We will endeavour to carry out these services outside of normal business hours and to give you at least three hours’ notice in writing (via email where possible); however you acknowledge that this may not be possible in cases of urgency.</p><p><em>Communication networks:</em> The Services may be subject to limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of communication networks and facilities.</p><p>We will not be liable to you if the Services are unavailable at any time, or for any period due to an event or cause outside of our control.</p><p>We reserve the right to suspend your access to or use of the Services without notice in the event you breach these Terms of Service or if we reasonably suspect that you have breached these Terms of Service.</p><p><strong>7. Using the Services</strong><br/> You must not use the Services for any commercial use (other than for internal use within your business), and you must not redistribute or transfer the Services, Documentation or Service Data to any third party or make any part of the Services, Documentation or Service Data available to be accessed, in whole or in part, by any third party.</p><p>The licence granted to you to install and make use of the Services, the Documentation, and Service Data, does not permit you to do, and you shall not do nor permit any third party to do, any of the following:<br/> • Embed our Services, Documentation, or Service Data into any product of yours or any third party;<br/> • Make available through automated or manual means any part of the Services, the Documentation, or the Service Data, by way of crawling, scraping, spidering or otherwise;<br/> • Copy or access all or any part of the Services, the Documentation, or the Service Data other than via the interface(s) provided to you by us;<br/> • Use web-crawlers, bots, or scripts to copy or access any part of the Services, the Documentation or the Service Data; or<br/> • Circumvent or attempt to override any security features we have installed around the Services, the Documentation, or the Service Data</p><p>You may not use the Services:<br/> (a) in any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation;<br/> (b) in any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect;<br/> (c) for the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any way;<br/> (d) to send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with our content standards (see below);<br/> (e) to transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam); and/or<br/> (f) to knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.</p><p>You also agree not to:<br/> (a) except as may be otherwise permitted in the Terms of Service or allowed by any applicable law which is incapable of exclusion by agreement between the parties:<br/>(i) duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, frame, mirror, republish, download, display, transmit or distribute all or any portion of the software used in the provision of the Services, or the Documentation or any Service Data in any form by any means;<br/> (ii) reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form all or any part of the software used in the provision of the Services.<br/> (b) access without authority, interfere with, manipulate, damage or disrupt all or any part of the Services or any equipment or network owned or used by any third party, or assist any third party in doing such acts;<br/> (c) use the Services, the Documentation and/or the Service Data to provide services to third parties, and in particular, not to use the Services, the Documentation and/or the Service Data in respect of any project that is not owned or used by you;<br/> (d) licence, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, display, disclose or otherwise commercial exploit the Services, Documentation and/or the Service Data, or otherwise make the Services, Documentation and/or the Service Data available to any third party.</p><p>If you wish to make use of the Services, the Documentation and/or the Service Data for the purposes prohibited in paragraphs (c) and/or (d) above, please email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c3a4a6ada6b1a2af83a0acada5aab1aeaaa0eda0acae">[email&#160;protected]</a> so that we can discuss a different licence with you.</p><p>The following content standards apply to any and all material which you provide to Confirmic or otherwise give Confirmic access to (“Materials”). The standards apply to each part of any Materials as well as to its whole.</p><p>Materials must:<br/> (a) be accurate (where they state facts);<br/> (b) be genuinely held (where they state opinions); and/or<br/> (c) comply with applicable law in the UK and in any country from which they are posted.</p><p>Materials must not:<br/> (a) contain any material which is defamatory of any person, obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory;<br/> (b) promote sexually explicit material, violence or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age;<br/> (c) infringe any copyright, database right or trade mark of any other person;<br/> (d) be likely to deceive any person;<br/> (e) be made in breach of any legal duty owed to a third party, such as a contractual duty or a duty of confidence;<br/> (f) be threatening, abuse or invade another’s privacy, or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety;<br/> (g) be likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;<br/> (h) be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person;<br/> (i) give the impression that they emanate from us, if this is not the case; and/or<br/> (j) advocate, promote or assist any unlawful act or illegal activity such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.</p><p>If you disclose security vulnerabilities to us, you must do so by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="86f5e3e5f3f4eff2ffc6e5e9e8e0eff4ebefe5a8e5e9eb">[email&#160;protected]</a> and not by posting to the confirmic.com website.</p><p><strong>8. Purchases</strong><br/> If you choose a paid-subscription plan, you agree to pay us fees in accordance with the relevant pricing plan. Details of those fees are set out on our Pricing Page at /pricing/ (which do not include VAT).</p><p>Depending on the pricing plan chosen by you, our third party payment processor will (and you hereby authorise it to) bill your payment card for the applicable fee in advance on or shortly after the date you subscribe for a paid plan and each month or anniversary thereafter, until terminated by you or us. The fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in these Terms of Service.</p><p>If you move to a higher tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect immediately and we will charge you for the additional fees associated with the new paid plan on a pro-rata basis. If you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect in the next billing cycle. You acknowledge that you will not receive a refund for the then-current billing cycle if you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, or to a non-payment subscription plan.</p><p>We reserve the right not to provide you with the Services until the relevant fee has been received in full and cleared funds.</p><p>We also reserve the right to change our fees or payment plans at any time. If you do not agree to such change, you must ask us to delete your account via email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="53202623233c212713303c3d353a213e3a307d303c3e">[email&#160;protected]</a> and stop using the Services within 30 days of the date the new fee or payment plan becomes effective, at which point these Terms of Service will be deemed to have been terminated by you. We will only charge you in respect of the period before termination and based on the old fee or payment plan. If you do agree to such change (which will be deemed from your continued use of the Services after the date the new fee or payment plan becomes effective), your next bill will include the new fees on a pro rata basis.</p><p><strong>9. Project Data and Rights you give us</strong><br/> We claim no intellectual property rights in and to your applications, project or any material in which you use the Service.</p><p>However, to enable your use of the Services, we do need to inspect elements of your website code structure. This information includes, but is not limited to, information relating to which third-party providers you use, which cookies and other tracking technologies are used, which policies have been created via your usage of the Confirmic Account, and records of consent from your customers (collectively, “Account Information”). For these purposes, we require, and you hereby grant us, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free licence to store, use, reproduce, display and transmit the Account Information, and any other materials transmitted via the Service to the extent necessary to enable your use of the Services, including monitoring services. This licence shall remain in effect until and unless these Terms of Service are terminated by you or us.</p><p><strong>10. Limitation of Liability</strong><br/> You agree to the following limitations on our liability to you:<br/> • <em>Exclusion of certain losses</em>: We shall not be liable to you for any loss of profits, business, anticipated savings, goodwill or business opportunity, business interruption, loss or corruption of data or information, or for any special, indirect or consequential loss or damage, howsoever arising under these Terms of Service; and<br/> • <em>Cap on liability:</em> Our maximum aggregate liability to you in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of these Terms of Service shall be limited to the aggregate amount of Fees paid by you to Confirmic during the three-month period immediately preceding the event that gave rise to your claim for damages.
