          <strong>License  and Intellectual Property</strong><strong> </strong><br><br>
          Unless  otherwise indicated, all of the content on the Digital Services including  product images, trademarks, illustrations, designs, icons, photographs,  artwork, images, and any video and audio materials are copyrights, trademarks,  trade names, brand names, trade dress, or other intellectual property protected  by U.S. International copyright, patent, trade secret, or trademark laws, and owned, controlled, or duly licenses by Private-Mail.  The Client shall have a  limited personal license for personal, non-commercial, private, and limited non-transferable  uses. Private-Mail may revoke this limited personal license at any time and for  any or no reason.  You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, modify,  download, display, post, or transmit any content from Private-Mail or its  Digital Services in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to,  electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without Private-Mail&rsquo;s  express written authorization to do so. You  may electronically copy and print to hard copy portions of the material  available through the Digital Services or statements provided on the Digital  Services for the sole purpose of using the information or materials for  informational and personal use only. Any other use of the Digital Services&rsquo;  content—including any commercial use, reproduction for purposes other than  described herein, modification, distribution, republication, display, or  performance, without the prior written permission of Private-Mail—is strictly  prohibited. The Client agrees not to alter, delete, obscure, or change any  proprietary rights affiliated with Private-Mail or the Digital Services&rsquo; content.  Private-Mail retains  all rights in and to its copyrights, trademarks, trade names, brand names,  trade dress, and other intellectual property depicted on the Digital Services.  </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Links  to Third Party Digital Services</strong><br><br>
          The  Digital Services may contain links to other websites and digital services (the &quot;Linked  Sites&quot;). The Linked Sites are not under the control of Private-Mail and  Private-Mail is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including  without limitation to any link contained in a Linked Site, or any changes or  updates to a Linked Site.  Private-Mail  provides Linked Sites only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any Linked  Site does not imply endorsement by Private-Mail of the Linked Sites or any  association with its operators.  <strong> </strong></p>
        <p><strong>User Sign up  Obligations</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>You need to sign up for a user account  by providing all required information in order to access or use the Digital  Services.  You agree to a) provide true,  accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the sign-up  process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during  sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. </p>
        <p>If you provide any information that is  untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if Private-Mail has reasonable grounds  to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or  incomplete, Private-Mail may immediately terminate your user account without  notice and refuse current or future use of any or all of the Digital Services. If  you represent an organization and wish to use the Digital Services for  corporate internal use, you must provide your corporate contact information. </p>
        <p><strong>Organization Accounts and Administrators</strong><br><br>
          When you sign up for an account for your organization or another  entity you may specify one or more administrators. The administrators will have  the right to configure the Digital Services based on your requirements and  manage end users in your organization&rsquo;s account. If your organization account  is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that  such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization. Make  sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying  such party&rsquo;s roles and restrictions as an administrator of your organization&rsquo;s  account.  <br>
          You are responsible for i) ensuring confidentiality of your  organization&rsquo;s username, password, and other sensitive information; ii)  appointing competent individuals as administrators for managing your organization&rsquo;s  account; and iii) ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with  your organization&rsquo;s account comply with this Agreement. You understand that  Private-Mail is not responsible for account administration and internal  management of the Digital Services for you, and that your entire organization,  including all of its users, agree to be and are bound by this Agreement, our  Privacy Policy, our DMCA policy, and all future modifications or amendments to  same.  </p>
        <p><strong>Maintaining Confidentiality of Your Username and  Password</strong></p>
        <p>You  are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username, password,  and other sensitive information.  You are  responsible for all activities that occur with your account, username, or  password, even if those activities were not authorized by you.  You must immediately notify us of any  unauthorized use of your account, username, or password by contacting us via  the phone number, live chat, or contact information posted on the Digital  Services.  In addition, if you believe or  suspect that your password has been compromised, you must promptly change your  password using the functionality provided on the Digital Services.  We reserve the right to take any action we  deem necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Digital Services  and your account, including without limitation, suspending or terminating your  account without notice.  We may rely on  the authority of anyone accessing your account or using your username or  password and in no event will we be held liable for any claims or damages  resulting from such reliance or from the compromise of your account, username,  or password.  Private-Mail will not be  held liable for any action or inaction taken under this provision, or for any  activities taken with your account, username, or password regardless of whether  those activities are taken by you, an authorized user of your account, or an  unauthorized user of your account.  </p>
        <p><strong>Use of Communications Services</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>The Digital  Services may contain discussion boards, chat areas, blogs, news groups, forums,  communities, web pages, calendars, or other message or communication facilities  designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group  (collectively, &quot;Communication Services&quot;). The Communication Services  are considered part of the Digital Services. You agree to use the Communication  Services only to post, send, and receive messages and material that are proper  and related to the Communication Services. </p>

Private-Mail  has no obligation to monitor the Communication Services.

        <p><strong>Restrictions on Use</strong><br><br>
          You agree to be solely  responsible for any activities or actions taken with  your account regardless of whether those activities or actions were taken by  you, an authorized user, or an unauthorized user.  As a condition of your  use of the Digital Services, you agree that you and  any other users with access to your account shall not use the  Digital Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by  Private-Mail&rsquo;s policies, terms, or conditions, such as, but not limited to:</p>

          <li>Taking any action that would interfere  with another party&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of the Digital Services; </li>
          <li>Uploading or otherwise disseminating  files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other software or program  that may damage the operation of another's server, network, computer system, or  resource;</li>
          <li>Illicitly accessing data,  systems, computers, or networks, including attempts to probe, scan, or test for  vulnerabilities of a system or network or to breach security or authentication  measures without the express written consent of the owner of the system or  network; </li>

          <li>Violating any applicable local, state,  national, or international law. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Export Control Policy</strong><br><br>
        You  accept full and personal responsibility for compliance with all applicable  export control laws.  Private-Mail is not  responsible for your failure to comply with all applicable export control laws. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ACCURACY,  RELIABILITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DIGITAL SERVICES</strong><br><br>
          Private-Mail accuracy,  reliability, availability, and quality of the Digital Services are not  guaranteed. While Private-Mail takes commercially reasonable efforts in  providing the Digital Services, Private-Mail will not be held responsible if  any data is lost, delayed, misdirected, or otherwise inaccessible, or if the  Digital Services are otherwise inaccurate, unreliable, or unavailable.  Also, Private-Mail may employ usage limits or  suspend, block, or cancel any Digital Service at our sole discretion at any  time without notification. Private-Mail does not guarantee the accuracy of any data,  messages, packages, or emails received.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Electronic Payments</strong><strong> </strong><br><br>
          You may make one-time  payments or schedule recurring payments by using a credit card, debit card,  U.S. bank account, or other method of payment as designated by Private-Mail.  Payment processing will be performed by a third-party compliant with Payment  Card Industry Data Security Standards. Private-Mail does not accept payments  directly. The designated third-party payment processor will collect credit  card, debit card, or U.S. bank account information from you. We will not  collect, store, or have any access to your credit card, debit card, or bank  account information during the payment process. Payments will be processed  promptly; however, several factors, many of which are outside our control, will  contribute to when we receive a payment from you and credit it to your account.  We make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to  complete processing of a payment.</p>
        <p>
          If a credit card  account is being used for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an  amount up to the amount of the payment. If you enroll to make recurring  payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card  you designate during the setup process. If you want to designate a different  credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your  information online. This may temporarily delay your ability to make online  payments while we verify your new payment information.</p>
        <p>
          You  represent and warrant that if you are making online payments that (i) all  credit card, debit card, and bank account information you supply is true,  correct, and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your  credit or debit card company, as well as bank, (iii) you will pay the charges  incurred by you in the amounts posted, including any applicable taxes, and (iv)  you are authorized to make the payment with the credit card debit card, or bank  account at issue.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>FEES</strong><br>
          <br>
          The Digital Services are available under subscription plans of  various durations. All accounts are offered as-is at the time of purchase and subject  to changes in the applicable fee structure.  Your subscription will be automatically  renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you inform us that you do  not wish to renew the subscription. At the time of automatic renewal, the subscription  fee will be charged to the Credit Card last used by you. We provide you the  option of changing the details if you would like the payment for the renewal to  be made through a different Credit Card. If you do not wish to renew the  subscription, you must inform us a reasonable period of time, no less than 72  hours, prior to the renewal date. If you have not downgraded to a free plan and  if you have not timely informed us that you do not wish to renew the  subscription, you will be presumed to have authorized Private-Mail to charge  the subscription fee to the Credit Card last used by you. </p>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may change the price of any Digital Service  or charge for use of Digital Services that are currently available free of  charge. Any increase in charges will not apply until the expiration of your  then current billing cycle. You will not be charged for using any Digital  Service unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan. </p>
        <p>
          The Client understands that  Private-Mail is not obligated to honor typographical or other pricing errors  and is not responsible for information or content provided on third-party  websites or affiliates.  Private-Mail shall have the right to refuse or cancel  any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or  debit card charged. If your credit or debit card has already been charged for  the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to  your credit or debit card account in the amount of the incorrect price that you  were charged for any orders cancelled by Private-Mail. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inactive User Accounts Policy</strong><br><br>
          We reserve the right  to terminate unpaid user accounts (which include accounts signed up for paid  service where payment has not been timely made) that are inactive for a  continuous period of 120 days or more. In the event of such termination, all  data associated with such user account will be deleted. We will provide you  prior notice of such termination and the option to back-up your data. The data  deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Digital  Services. Each Digital Service will be considered an independent and separate  service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other  words, activity in one of the Digital Services is not sufficient to keep your  user account in another Digital Service active. In case of accounts with more  than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be  considered inactive. </p>
        <p>
         <strong>REFUND POLICY</strong><br>
    <br>
  If you are less than 100% satisfied with the PrivateMail.com Email services, we will gladly refund your payment if the refund is requested within seven (7) days from the date of the purchase, requests made later than the 7 day purchase date window will be denied, however there are some exceptions in this period: <br><br>

YOU  AGREE THAT YOU MUST EVALUATE, AND THAT YOU SOLELY BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED  WITH, THE USE OF THE DIGITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY RELIANCE ON THE ACCURACY,  COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR USEFULNESS OF THE DIGITAL SERVICES  OR ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DIGITAL SERVICES.  MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OBTAINED THROUGH  THE USE OF THE DIGITAL SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND  YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, MOBILE  TELEPHONE, WIRELESS DEVICE, OR DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE DIGITAL SERVICES  OR THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.  <br>
          PRIVATE-MAIL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF  ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIGITAL SERVICES, NOR FOR ANY DAMAGES  FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF OTHER INTANGIBLES, LOSS  OF SECURITY OF INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE  DIGITAL SERVICES, OR UNAUTHORIZED INTERCEPTION OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION BY THIRD  PARTIES, EVEN IF ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES. FURTHER, WE WILL  NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE DIGITAL  SERVICES OR FROM ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS ON THE SITE. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE  FOR ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.  YOUR  SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE DIGITAL SERVICES IS TO  STOP USING THE SITE. OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES  OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,  NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE THE TOTAL AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU TO US  TO ACCESS AND USE THE DIGITAL SERVICES.  <br>
          THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF  LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE  JURISDICTION.  TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS  DETERMINED THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CONFLICTS WITH ANY OTHER  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE  INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE BROADEST LIMITATION OF LIABILITY POSSIBLE.  IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW FOR LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES  OR EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF CERTAIN DAMAGES; SOLELY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH  LAW APPLIES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY  NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

        <p><br>
          If you are a California resident or resident of a  state with a similar applicable law, you hereby expressly waive California  Civil Code section 1542 in connection with the foregoing (or such other similar  applicable law in your state), which states: &ldquo;A general release does not extend  to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to  exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if  known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with  the debtor or released party.&rdquo; </p>
        <p><br>
          <strong>INDEMNITY</strong><br>
          <br>
          Except to the extent prohibited under  applicable law, you agree to and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless  Private-Mail and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against all claims, damages,  obligations, losses, liabilities, costs,   debts, and expenses (including  attorney fees, costs, and other expenses associated with complying with a  subpoena for information or other service of process) arising out of any  violation of this Agreement or related to your use of the Digital Services,  including but not limited to any activities, actions, or inactions taken (or  not taken) with the Digital Services or with your account, username, or  password regardless of whether those activities, actions, or inactions were  taken (or not taken) by you, an authorized user, or an unauthorized user.  Private-Mail reserves the right, at your  expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which  you are required to indemnify us or any other indemnitee hereunder and you  agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle  any matter without the prior written consent of Private-Mail. Private-Mail will  use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding  upon becoming aware of it. <br>
          If  you are a California resident or resident of a state with a similar applicable  law, you hereby expressly waive California Civil Code section 1542 in  connection with the foregoing (or such other similar applicable law in your  state), which states: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims that the  creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her  favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her,  would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or  released party.&rdquo; <br>
          Your defense and  indemnification obligation will survive the termination of this Agreement and  shall continue to be in effect, even after you cease using the Digital Services.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>AGREEMENT  TO ARBITRATE</strong><br><br>
          You and Private-Mail  agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise  between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this  section (the &ldquo;Agreement to Arbitrate&rdquo;). Please read the Agreement to Arbitrate  carefully. It affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have  against each other are resolved.<br>
          If a dispute arises  between you and Private-Mail, we want to learn about and address your concerns  and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a  neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Please  contact us regarding disputes between you and Private-Mail related to the  Digital Services.</p>
        <p><br>
          You and Private-Mail  each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise  between you and Private-Mail, <strong>EXCEPT FOR A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE  ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, PRIVATE-MAIL'S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS'  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,</strong> shall be resolved exclusively through  confidential, final, and binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act  governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.  Any award  of the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent  jurisdiction. <br>
          YOU AND PRIVATE-MAIL  AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL  BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE  ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PRIVATE-MAIL AGREE OTHERWISE, THE  ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS  AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE,  OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY,  INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY  SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED  BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PRIVATE-MAIL  DIGITAL SERVICES USERS.</p>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be  conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its  rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for  Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to  Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating  arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at  http://www.adr.org.<br>
          The arbitration shall  be held in Orange County, Florida. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000  or less, you or Private-Mail may elect to have the arbitration conducted by  telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be  binding on you and Private-Mail subject to the arbitrator&rsquo;s discretion to  require an in-person hearing. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by  telephone by you and Private-Mail unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator will  decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of  Florida, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims  of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be confidential,  final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be  entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Payment of all filing, administration, and  arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.</p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Private-Mail agree  that if we make any change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change  to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that  change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding  against Private-Mail prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we  seek to terminate the Agreement to Arbitrate as included in this Agreement, any  such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the  version of this Agreement not containing the Agreement to Arbitrate is posted  to the Digital Services, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was  filed in a legal proceeding against Private-Mail prior to the effective date of  termination. <br>
          To the extent that it  is determined in any particular case that arbitration is not permitted, has  been waived, or is otherwise unavailable, then the sole  and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action or proceeding arising out  of or related to this Agreement shall be in an appropriate state or federal  court located in Orange County, Florida. You hereby submit to the jurisdiction  and venue of said Courts.  You  agree that the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of  conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has  arisen or may arise between you and Private-Mail, except as otherwise stated in  this Agreement.  This provision shall not  be read to conflict with the Agreement to Arbitrate.  </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Claims  and Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year</strong> <br><br>
          To  the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any disclaimer,  release of liability, or agreement to indemnify contained herein, any cause of  action or claim you may have with respect to your use of the Digital Services,  including, without limitation, any Digital Services related product, services,  or other content must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause  of action arises. This section applies to you and your heirs, successors, and  assigns. <br><br>
          <strong>SEVERANCE</strong><br>
          <br><br>
          If any term, clause, provision, or section of this Agreement is held invalid or  unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall  terminate this Agreement with the exception of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability and  Warranty Disclaimer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreement to Arbitrate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Indemnity&rdquo; sections.  These sections survive this Agreement and  your use of the Digital Services, and will be interpreted to apply to the  fullest extent possible.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Additional Terms</strong><br><br>
          No  delay or failure by Private-Mail to enforce any portion of the Agreement shall  be a waiver of any of its rights under the Agreement. The terms, conditions,  rights, and licenses contained in this Agreement may not be transferred or  assigned by you, but may be assigned by Private-Mail without restriction. You  agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship  exists between you and Private-Mail as a result of this agreement or your use  of the Digital Services. Private-Mail's performance of this Agreement is  subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this  Agreement is in derogation of Private-Mail's right to comply with governmental,  court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the  Digital Services or information. Unless otherwise specified herein, this  Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Private-Mail and it  supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether  electronic, oral, or written, between you and Private-Mail with respect to the  subject matter of this Agreement.  Private-Mail may, for any or no reason, terminate your account and  access to any or all of the Digital Services at any time without notice. </p>
