        <p>Personally identifiable information refers to information about you  that can be used to contact or identify you. It includes, but is not limited  to, your name, phone number, email address, postal address, and social  networking information. The collected information falls into the following  categories: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>identifiers (e.g., name, alias, postal  address, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account  name, or similar identifiers); </li>
          <li>information that identifies, relates to,  describes, or is capable of being associated with an individual (e.g., credit  card number, telephone number, address, or similar information. </li>
          <li>internet or other electronic network  activity (e.g., browsing history, search history, and information regarding a  consumer&rsquo;s interaction with an online site or application, or similar  information); </li>
          <li>geolocation data; </li>
          <li>audio, electronic, or similar  information; and </li>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Private-Mail may also collect certain non-identifying information,  or aggregate information, such as anonymous demographic information including  zip codes, dates of birth, customer preferences, information about customer  computer hardware and software, as well as information about the links and  pages that users access within Private-Mail&rsquo;s website. Certain non-identifying  information may be considered personally identifiable information if combined  with other information which may enable you to be identified (such as a zip  code with a street address); however, the same information when taken alone or  combined with other non-identifying information, will be considered non-identifying  information. </p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally  identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Private-Mail&rsquo;s  blog or to third parties through the use of Private-Mail&rsquo;s services, such  information may be collected and used by others. </p>
        <p>Occasionally Private-Mail will offer links to and utilize third-party  websites, such as those used to process payments from you on Private-Mails&rsquo;s  behalf. Private-Mail encourages you to review the privacy policies of these websites  so that you can understand how these websites collect, use, and share your  information. Private-Mail is not responsible for the privacy policies or other  content on websites other than Private-Mail websites. </p>
        <p><strong>USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>Private-Mail may store and use your personally identifiable  information for (i) communicating with you; (ii) product or service fulfillment,  such as maintaining or servicing accounts, processing payments, or processing  orders and transactions; (iii) voluntary marketing, promotional, and  advertising purposes, such as to inform you of promotional offers from  Private-Mail; (iv) internal operations, such as improving your customer  experience – this includes auditing current interactions, optimizing user  experience, and undertaking activities to verify and maintain the quality and  safety of the services; (v) detecting security incidents, protecting against  malicious, deceptive activity, and taking all necessary and appropriate steps  to mitigate current and future risk; (vi) debugging and repairing internal  information technology as necessary; (vii) undertaking internal research for  technological development and demonstration; and (viii) sharing with trusted  third-party service providers with your consent to help Private-Mail process  payments and perform activities to improve your customer experience.

          <li>internet or other electronic network  activity (e.g., browsing history, search history, and information regarding a  consumer&rsquo;s interaction with an online site or application, or similar information); </li>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Private-Mail does not sell, rent, or lease your personally  identifiable information to third parties.  </p>
        <p>Private-Mail is not limited in our use of aggregate information  that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, such as  the number of users of our services, the geographic distribution of our users,  the amount of information located or removed, etc.  For example, Private-Mail may use aggregate  information concerning which links and pages users access within Private-Mail&rsquo;s  website for purposes of improving its blog and tutorials. </p>

        <p><strong>SECURITY PROTECTIONS FOR YOUR DATA</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>Private-Mail  takes the security of your personal information very seriously.  Private-Mail uses reasonable administrative,  physical, and technical safeguards to secure the personal information you share  with us. </p>
        <p>You are  responsible for all activities that occur under your account.  The security of your Private-Mail account  relies on your protection of your user profile information.  You are responsible for maintaining the  security of your user profile information, including your password and for all  activities that occur under your account. You may not share your password with  anyone.  We will never ask you to send us  your password or other sensitive information in an email, though we may ask you  to enter this type of information on a Private-Mail website. </p>
        <p>Any email  or other communication purporting to be from one of our websites requesting your  password or asking you to provide sensitive account information via email  should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to us  immediately at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b5d4d1d8dcdbf5c5c7dcc3d4c1d0d8d4dcd99bd6dad8">[email&#160;protected]</a>. If you believe someone else has obtained  access to your password, please change it immediately and report it immediately  by emailing us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c7a6a3aaaea987b7b5aeb1a6b3a2aaa6aeabe9a4a8aa">[email&#160;protected]</a>. </p>
        <p><strong>USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>Private-Mail  websites may use a first party cookie to collect anonymous traffic data, a form  of aggregate information. &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are simple text files stored on your  computer for use by a browser. Private-Mail may use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to assist in data  collection and to track visitor website usage and trends to help us better  serve you. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view our websites,  but your ability to use some areas of the websites will be limited. Some of our  business partners and publishers (e.g., analytical tracking software providers)  use cookies and tracking technologies on our websites. We have no access to or  control over these third-party cookies or tracking technologies. This Privacy Policy  covers the use of cookies on our websites by us only and does not cover the use  of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner. </p>
        <p>When you  visit Private-Mail&rsquo;s website, Private-Mail automatically collects the name of  the website you visited from (called the &ldquo;referring page&rdquo;) and the name of the  website you chose to visit immediately after ours (called the &ldquo;exit page&rdquo;), and  information about other websites you have recently visited. This information is  used to improve our website, but we cannot identify you from any information we  receive from cookies. Some browsers have a &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; feature that lets you  tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.  These features are not yet uniform, and our websites are not currently set up  to respond to those signals for tracking on our websites. </p>
        <p><strong>PARTICIPATION IN INTERNET BASED ADVERTISING</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>Private-Mail  may also participate in interest-based advertising using similar technology.  Therefore, you may see advertising on our websites tailored to how you browse  or shop, or you may see advertising for Private-Mail and its properties on  other websites based on your browsing behavior across websites. Some websites  where we may advertise belong to ad networks that use your web browsing history  to choose which ads to display on their network websites; these ads include  advertising for Private-Mail and its websites, but no personal information  about you is shared with those third party ad networks. Other websites where  you see our ads, such as Facebook, may use interest preferences that you have  chosen on those sites, as well as registration and other information about you,  to choose which ads to display to you. Some internet browsers, mobile devices,  and websites such as Facebook may offer opt-outs for interest-based  advertising. Please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser,  or your device settings for additional information. </p>
        <p>You can  opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third parties who are members of  the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising  Alliance&rsquo;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by  visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website  (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA website (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). </p>
        <p><strong>GOOGLE ANALYTICS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>We utilize  Google Analytics, which stores information about what pages you visit, how long  you are on our website, how you got here, and what links you click on. This  analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our website  and is not tied to any Personally Identifiable Information. If you would like  to opt out of Google Analytics, Google has developed a tool that works with  major internet browsers to permit you to opt-out. For more information and to  install their opt-out tool, please click here:&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. </p>
