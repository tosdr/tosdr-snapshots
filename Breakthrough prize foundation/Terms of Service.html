	<li><strong class="caps">Arbitration Agreement; Dispute resolution by binding arbitration<br>Please read this section carefully as it affects your rights.</strong>

		<ol>
			<li>Agreement to Arbitrate: This Section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Foundation, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
			<li class="caps">Prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief: you and foundation agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and foundation agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).</li>
			<li>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: Foundation is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most participant concerns can be resolved quickly and to the participant’s satisfaction by emailing Foundation’s support team at <a href="mailto:info@breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org">info@breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org</a>. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Foundation should be sent to Breakthrough Prize Foundation, c/o 1900 N Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20036 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Foundation and You do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, You or Foundation may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Foundation or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or Foundation is entitled.</li>
			<li>Arbitration Procedures: Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, <a href="http://www.adr.org/consumer" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of the AAA Rules as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and Conditions and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</li>
			<li>Unless Foundation and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, Foundation agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li>
			<li>Costs of Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</li>
			<li>Confidentiality: All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</li>
			<li>Severability: If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than clause (b) above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of clause (b) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue to apply.</li>

				You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 13, your DMCA notice may not be valid.
			</li>
			<li>If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

				<ol>
					<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
					<li>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
					<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and</li>
					<li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
				</ol>

			</li>
			<li>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Foundation may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Foundation's sole discretion.</li>
		</ol>

	</li>

	<li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

		<ol>
			<li>The Agreement is the entire agreement between You and Foundation relating to the subject matter herein, and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between You and Foundation with respect to said subject matter. This Agreement shall not be modified except in a writing signed by both parties, or by a change made as provided in Clause 2.2. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the remainder of this Agreement, which is severable from said provision and will remain in full force and effect.</li>
			<li>If You breach any provision of this Agreement and Foundation has knowledge of that breach, a failure to pursue legal action or to enforce any remedy against You will not constitute a waiver of its legal rights. Any waiver of rights under this Agreement must be in writing and signed by Foundation.</li>
			<li>All matters relating to this Website and this Agreement are governed by and are to be construed according to the laws applicable in the state of California, United States (without regard to any rules governing choice of law).
