The Website is owned and operated by Pinch of Awesome, LP (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to anyone using or viewing our Website and to information provided to us via the Website by visitors, customers or users of our Website (&ldquo;users,&rdquo; &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;). However, it does not apply to information collected from our employees, contractors or vendors, or from anyone via any hard copy communications.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Information collected through the Website may be transferred, used and stored in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we, our users, or our agents for the Website are located now or at any time in the future. If you access the Website, you consent to the capture, storage, transfer, use and processing of your Personal Information (as defined below) in and between all of those jurisdictions.&nbsp; The data protection and other laws in some countries and jurisdictions (such as the Federal laws and some State laws in the United States) are not as comprehensive or stringent as the privacy laws in other countries and jurisdictions (such as the laws of the European Union).&nbsp; You agree that all transactions relating to our Website shall be deemed to have occurred in the United States, where we currently have all of our personnel and operations.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may collect Personal Information in connection with our Website. You may always choose not to provide Personal Information, but this may prevent you from receiving certain services. When we use the term &ldquo;Personal Information,&rdquo; we mean information that can be used to identify an individual and may include your full or partial first and last name, postal business or home address, electronic email address, user ID, password, telephone number, and fax number.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our Website may not be used or accessed by individuals under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence or from where you are accessing the Website where 18 is not the age of majority).&nbsp; However, in the event that our Website is improperly accessed by any users under the age of majority in violation of our terms and conditions, the Website does not intentionally collect any Personal Information from such individuals, nor do we authorize or want such information to be provided to us.&nbsp; If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a user under the age of majority, upon receipt of notice from a parent or guardian of such user, we will delete that user&rsquo;s Personal Information and/or disable such information from being viewed or accessed by any other user or other third party.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may also collect &ldquo;Non-Personal Information&rdquo; about you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Non-Personal Information&rdquo; means information that is not Personal Information, including, without limitation, aggregated and anonymized information.&nbsp; Examples of the Non-Personal Information we may collect include, but are not limited to: your IP address; your search queries; information about your operating system and browser (such as maker and version); information, content or advertisements you view, hover over or click on; and city and state (but not precise geographic location) in which you are located.&nbsp; We will not use Non-Personal Information to try to identify you, and if we associate any Non-Personal Information with information that personally identifies you, then we will treat it as Personal Information.&nbsp; We may also use the data we collect to determine which search engines to direct your queries to through our custom search feature, and to determine compensation under our arrangements with our search provider partners and other companies.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may also share web log information with our search provider partners and other partners so that they can deliver relevant results in response to your search queries.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Information from our Website may be collected by us or by one of our service providers but in either case, this Privacy Policy will govern the collection, use and sharing of that information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Website contains third party content and links to third party websites and other materials, including without limitation videos, images, graphics, audio and text.&nbsp; Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices, or content of websites or materials owned by others that may link to or that may be linked from or integrated with the Website (Third Party Sites&rdquo;).&nbsp; Accordingly, we encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of Third Party Sites so that you understand how those websites collect, use and share your Personal Information.</p>

However, we will provide you with advance written notice in the event any such transfer would subject your Personal Information to materially different privacy practices.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Non-Personal Information (including aggregate, technical or demographic information) can also be collected through the standard operation of our internet servers and logs as well as other automatic data collection tools such as &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; and other similar technologies.&nbsp; A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small text file that is recorded either temporarily or persistently on your hard drive and that a website can use in order to recognize visitors who revisit the website so as to facilitate their ongoing access to and use of the website.&nbsp; Information we may collect through cookies and other similar technologies includes your browser type, language preference, operating system, referring website (if applicable), the name and type of your computer or mobile device, the operating system of your device, your general geographic location, the date and time of each user visit or request, and the Website endpoints that you accessed or visited during your use of the Website.&nbsp; In addition to other uses as described in this Privacy Policy, we may gather the information we collect from each user and perform statistical analysis of the aggregated information, including analysis about the behavior of visitors to our Website on an aggregated, anonymous basis.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Any Non-Personal information we collect from you through the use of our cookies, web beacons and other technologies may also be used by us and/or shared with our affiliated companies to target content and advertising to you on the Website. We may also allow unaffiliated third-party companies such as advertising networks to serve ads and/or collect anonymous, Non-Personal Information when you visit our Website. These unaffiliated third-party companies may collect and use Non-Personal Information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide relevant content or advertisements that are likely to be of greater interest to you. This collection and use of Non-Personal Information would be governed by unaffiliated third-party companies&rsquo; own privacy policies. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacons to collect this information.

    <li><strong> YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></li>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Currently, we do not intend to share your Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
