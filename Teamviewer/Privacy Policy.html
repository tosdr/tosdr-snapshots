Google Analytics uses “cookies”, i.e. text files that are stored on your computer and enable analysis of your use of our website. When you visit our website for the first time, you will be assigned a cookie with a unique user identification, i.e. a&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>Google Analytics Client ID&lt;/b>. We may replace this Google Analytics Client ID with your TeamViewer Device ID if you use one of our products (please refer to our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#products\&#34;>Product Privacy Policy&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for details).

You can also block the collection of the data generated by the cookie and the data related to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing a browser plugin available from the following link:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\&#34;>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Please visit the website&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en\&#34;>https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for an overview on Google’s approach on data protection for Google Analytics as well as their privacy policy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en\&#34;>https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>2. Demandbase&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer uses web analytics services provided by Demandbase Inc., located at 680 Folsom Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94107 USA. Demandbase utilizes tracking technology, which includes the storing and accessing of cookies, to collect data about website visitors. Demandbase’s Tags, or JavaScript, pixels, cookies or other similar technology or code, cause a unique cookie ID to be associated with each visitor who accesses our website and may sync with third-party cookies. Demandbase’s Tags on our website may collect data on device information (such as a website visitor’s IP address), cookies, or other technical information (such as web browser type, operating system or timestamp).&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>The Demandbase Tags are used for analytics and advertising services provided by Demandbase. They are also used for performance and optimization of Demandbase data and reporting. Demandbase’s services help us tailor our communications and improve the quality of the content we provide to our prospects, users, and customers. It also helps to improve our website user experience and performance by personalizing and optimizing the website for visitors.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>For further information on Demandbase’s privacy approach, visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.demandbase.com/privacy-policy/\&#34;>https://www.demandbase.com/privacy-policy/&lt;/a>. For more details on the cookies used by Demandbase, visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.demandbase.com/cookies/\&#34;>https://www.demandbase.com/cookies/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>3. Google AdWords Conversion and Google Remarketing&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer’s website uses Google AdWords in order to generate attention for our products and services by conducting targeted advertising campaigns on third-party websites and apps. Data generated by such campaigns helps us to determine the success rate of individual campaigns. TeamViewer aims at providing you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculate advertising expenses accurately.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google through a so-called Ad Server. Along with this, TeamViewer uses&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>Ad Server Cookies&lt;/b>, which scale certain parameters, such as display of ads or clicks by users. When you click on an ad delivered by Google that redirects you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like a&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;(markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, TeamViewer and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the TeamViewer website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across different sites by TeamViewer, as is the case for all other AdWords customers. TeamViewer merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can evaluate which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by the particular advertisement is not forwarded to TeamViewer; particularly, we cannot personally identify users through this information.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Through this (re-)marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s servers. Please note that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are subject to Google’s privacy policy and beyond TeamViewer’s control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular TeamViewer website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways, e.g. through:&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;ul>\r\n&lt;li>a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation in order to prevent receiving third-party ads;&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous\&#34;>https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous&lt;/a>, however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies; or&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>permanently deactivating cookies in your browser under&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996\&#34;>https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;/ul>\r\n&lt;p>Further information on Google’s approach to data privacy can be found under&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en\&#34;>https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&lt;/a>. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the advertising network initiative, by following the instructions at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F\&#34;>https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>In addition to Google AdWords, TeamViewer uses the tool “&lt;b>Google Remarketing&lt;/b>.” This is an application that allows us to address you again, even when you have left our website. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored on your device, which track and analyze user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visits to our website.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through Remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, the data processed for these purposes is generally limited to pseudonymous information.

    <h3><b>ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS</b></h3>
<p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other tracking technologies which collect information about your use of our services and other websites and applications. This information may be used by TeamViewer and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interest on our services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.</p>
<p>Such tools include:</p>
<h3>1. Google Analytics and Other Analysis Tools Provided by Google</h3>
<p>TeamViewer uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, or any other Affiliate of Google LLC (“<b>Google</b>“). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, i.e. text files that are stored on your computer and enable analysis of your use of our website. When you visit our website for the first time, you will be assigned a cookie with a unique user identification, i.e. a <b>Google Analytics Client ID</b>. We may replace this Google Analytics Client ID with your TeamViewer Device ID if you use one of our products (please refer to our <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#products">Product Privacy Policy</a> for details). We will add the respective data point to the data available in the Google Analytics tools, and this way we use Google Analytics also for cross-device analyses of user streams.</p>
<p>Other tools we use in this context that are also provided by Google include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Google Tag Manager</b> (a tag management system that allows TeamViewer to quickly and easily update tracking codes and related code fragments collectively known as “tags” on our website or mobile app);</li>
<li><b>Google Big Query</b> (an enterprise data warehouse that enables SQL queries using the processing power of Google’s infrastructure; TeamViewer uses Big Query to store and query data sets which are collected by Google services such as Google Analytics, and the Big Query data is used to build flexible reports for evaluating our website performance);</li>
<li><b>Google Display Network</b> (used to measure the impact of unclicked Google Display Network ad impressions on the website, behavior of users, and conversions; please refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3105620">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3105620</a> for further information); and</li>
<li><b>Google Optimize</b> (for A/B testing, offering to analyze user behavior by showing slightly varied website contents to different user groups, depending on profile matching; thereby, TeamViewer analyzes its online services, improves its web offerings, and can create an interesting user journey).</li>
</ul>
<p>TeamViewer Group uses data gathered through your Google Analytics Client ID as well as other data generated from Google’s web analytics applications in order to perform analyses of your interactions with our products, services, and websites. With the help of Google’s Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, we will receive analyses on our users’ age, gender, and interest categories (please refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en</a> for further information). We strive to offer you tailored products and services that are best suited for your individual circumstances. To that end, Google provides us with insights and statistics that help us to make our online presence, our communications to you, and ultimately our products more interesting and relevant for you.</p>
<p>As further explained in our <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#cookie-notice">Cookies Policy</a>, you may block cookies from being stored on your device, and consequently prevent the described analyses from being conducted, by adjusting the settings in your browser software; however, in such case, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of our website. You can also block the collection of the data generated by the cookie and the data related to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing a browser plugin available from the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Demandbase</h3>
<p>TeamViewer uses web analytics services provided by Demandbase Inc., located at 680 Folsom Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94107 USA. Demandbase utilizes tracking technology, which includes the storing and accessing of cookies, to collect data about website visitors. Demandbase’s Tags, or JavaScript, pixels, cookies or other similar technology or code, cause a unique cookie ID to be associated with each visitor who accesses our website and may sync with third-party cookies. Demandbase’s Tags on our website may collect data on device information (such as a website visitor’s IP address), cookies, or other technical information (such as web browser type, operating system or timestamp).</p>
<p>The Demandbase Tags are used for analytics and advertising services provided by Demandbase. They are also used for performance and optimization of Demandbase data and reporting. Demandbase’s services help us tailor our communications and improve the quality of the content we provide to our prospects, users, and customers. It also helps to improve our website user experience and performance by personalizing and optimizing the website for visitors.</p>

<h3>3. Google AdWords Conversion and Google Remarketing</h3>
<p>TeamViewer’s website uses Google AdWords in order to generate attention for our products and services by conducting targeted advertising campaigns on third-party websites and apps. Data generated by such campaigns helps us to determine the success rate of individual campaigns. TeamViewer aims at providing you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculate advertising expenses accurately.</p>
<p>Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google through a so-called Ad Server. Along with this, TeamViewer uses <b>Ad Server Cookies</b>, which scale certain parameters, such as display of ads or clicks by users. When you click on an ad delivered by Google that redirects you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like a <b>unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information</b> (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser.</p>
<p>If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, TeamViewer and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the TeamViewer website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across different sites by TeamViewer, as is the case for all other AdWords customers. TeamViewer merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can evaluate which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by the particular advertisement is not forwarded to TeamViewer; particularly, we cannot personally identify users through this information.</p>
<p>Through this (re-)marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s servers. Please note that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are subject to Google’s privacy policy and beyond TeamViewer’s control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular TeamViewer website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways, e.g. through:</p>
<ul>
<li>a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation in order to prevent receiving third-party ads;</li>
<li>deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous">https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous</a>, however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies; or</li>
<li>permanently deactivating cookies in your browser under <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information on Google’s approach to data privacy can be found under <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the advertising network initiative, by following the instructions at <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F">https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Google AdWords, TeamViewer uses the tool “<b>Google Remarketing</b>.” This is an application that allows us to address you again, even when you have left our website. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored on your device, which track and analyze user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visits to our website.</p>
<p>According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through Remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, the data processed for these purposes is generally limited to pseudonymous information. If you do not want to be exposed to data processing through the Google Remarketing feature, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous">https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Social Media Tracking Tools, including “Tracking Pixels”</h3>

If technically possible, the API contacts Google servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes, updated models and hardware accelerator compatibility information. It may also send telemetry data about the performance and utilization of the API in the Assist AR App to Google. Such data include device information, application information, device or other identifiers, performance metrics, API configuration, event type and error codes (you can find further information here). Google uses this data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the API, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in Google’s Privacy Policy.

Adding devices to your account&lt;br />\r\n &lt;/h5>\r\n&lt;p>When you add so called managed devices to your TeamViewer account, we activate these devices as endpoints that are assigned to your license. To achieve that, TeamViewer collects, and processes certain data associated with those managed devices, e.g., screen name, TeamViewer ID, Machine ID, email address, account ID, License ID and, if mobile device management is purchased: location data, and mobile device data. During the activation of an endpoint TeamViewer needs to ensure that the Product is used in accordance with the EULA and Product Specifications.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>This is done to assign and enforce the license limits as agreed with you under your contract.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&lt;i>The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.&lt;br />\r\n  &lt;/i>&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h5>C.1.6.

Furthermore, we may process the information on your location, since your location is the determining factor when deciding the storage location for your data (e.g., if you are located within the European Union, you will be assigned the cloud in Europe).&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>We process certain information in order to manage your account and provide you Backup services under the contractual agreement with you.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&lt;i>The legal basis to process this personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.&lt;br />\r\n  &lt;/i>&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h5>C.1.7.

Product improvement and technical support&lt;br />\r\n &lt;/h5>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer may process personal data to analyze server and device logs in order to identify vulnerabilities, crashes as well as other issues to consequently mitigate or fix them. During such analysis certain information that may include personal data is analyzed, such as the user information (e.g., email, IP address, status, language, organization), session ID, device ID, call or workflow data, license data, call ID, workflow information (ID, title, etc.), multimedia assets (e.g., type of the asset, ID, name etc.), information related to certain task (ID; name, comment, creation date etc.), or picking information (order ID, shelf location, status etc.). We are processing your personal data in connection with its product improvement activities in order to provide you with better and improved services, and, consequently, for the enhancement of the contract with you.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Please note that TeamViewer has put additional technical and organizational measures in place, e.g., pseudonymization as well as further strong technical and organizational measures to ensure security of the data. It is also important to note that we never access any content or connection data itself, but rather observe your interactions with our Software and Services.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>For product improvement purposes, the overall usage patterns of TeamViewer Products are analyzed, e.g., information about how certain features of the Software and the Server Services are used, as well as the interactions.

To do so, we need to evaluate the usage of the Software in order to recognize abusive or abnormal patterns and thus to help protect our network and service integrity at any time. Doing so, we may process certain personal data, e.g., data associated with your remote connections, IP addresses, derived locations, various user interactions and patterns as well as device information (e.g., device IDs as well as TeamViewer IDs).

    <h5>C.1.4. Using Text recognition feature (Frontline and Assist AR)<br />
</h5>
<h5> </h5>
<p>Functionalities of Frontline and Assist AR include, amongst others, a text recognition feature. It is based on the use of a text recognition API provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, United States (“Google”), that also enables the activation of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality on smart glasses used with Frontline and Assist AR. If technically possible, the API contacts Google servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes, updated models and hardware accelerator compatibility information. It may also send telemetry data about the performance and utilization of the API in the Assist AR App to Google. Such data include device information, application information, device or other identifiers, performance metrics, API configuration, event type and error codes (you can find further information here). Google uses this data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the API, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in Google’s Privacy Policy. Before you may use this feature, we ask for your consent to the described data processing.</p>
<p><i>The legal basis to process this personal data as described under this Section, is your consent and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.<br />
  </i></p>
<h5>C.1.5. Adding devices to your account<br />
 </h5>
<p>When you add so called managed devices to your TeamViewer account, we activate these devices as endpoints that are assigned to your license. To achieve that, TeamViewer collects, and processes certain data associated with those managed devices, e.g., screen name, TeamViewer ID, Machine ID, email address, account ID, License ID and, if mobile device management is purchased: location data, and mobile device data. During the activation of an endpoint TeamViewer needs to ensure that the Product is used in accordance with the EULA and Product Specifications.</p>
<p>This is done to assign and enforce the license limits as agreed with you under your contract.</p>
<p><i>The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.<br />
  </i></p>
<h5>C.1.6. Using the Backup feature<br />
 </h5>
<p>If you choose to use our optional feature Backup, we may process the information on your purchased storage limits in order to assign you the relevant storage space and, in case the limit is reached, inform you of the storage limitation. Furthermore, we may process the information on your location, since your location is the determining factor when deciding the storage location for your data (e.g., if you are located within the European Union, you will be assigned the cloud in Europe).</p>
<p>We process certain information in order to manage your account and provide you Backup services under the contractual agreement with you.</p>

<h5>C.1.7. Using add-ons<br />
 </h5>
<p>If you use add-ons (e.g., the security services provided by Malwarebytes Inc., the mobile device management provided by Ivanti UK Ltd. or the asset management and discovery provided by Lansweeper NV) we may process certain license information, your name, email address username, IP address, your device information and similar in order to activate your license and respectively link it to your account.  </p>

<h5>C.1.8. Product improvement and technical support<br />
 </h5>
<p>TeamViewer may process personal data to analyze server and device logs in order to identify vulnerabilities, crashes as well as other issues to consequently mitigate or fix them. During such analysis certain information that may include personal data is analyzed, such as the user information (e.g., email, IP address, status, language, organization), session ID, device ID, call or workflow data, license data, call ID, workflow information (ID, title, etc.), multimedia assets (e.g., type of the asset, ID, name etc.), information related to certain task (ID; name, comment, creation date etc.), or picking information (order ID, shelf location, status etc.). We are processing your personal data in connection with its product improvement activities in order to provide you with better and improved services, and, consequently, for the enhancement of the contract with you.</p>
<p>Please note that TeamViewer has put additional technical and organizational measures in place, e.g., pseudonymization as well as further strong technical and organizational measures to ensure security of the data. It is also important to note that we never access any content or connection data itself, but rather observe your interactions with our Software and Services.</p>
<p>For product improvement purposes, the overall usage patterns of TeamViewer Products are analyzed, e.g., information about how certain features of the Software and the Server Services are used, as well as the interactions. This may include the session metadata, feature usage (e.g., remote control, file transfer, settings, etc.), and how frequently they are being used. This information helps improve and further develop TeamViewer Products, e.g., to help decide whether certain functionalities of the Software shall be kept, amended, or improved, or whether to create new features or improve the design. Please note, that TeamViewer only assesses the interactions and at no point information or data that is being exchanged between you and your connection partner(s).</p>

The following sections outline the categories of data processed by us and respective purposes for such processing. If the legal basis for a processing is your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, such withdrawal however will not have any impact on the legitimacy of the processing itself prior to withdrawal of your consent.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>I. Management of investor relations&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>We may process your personal data collected at the events or roadshows, such as your name and contact information, as well as in connection with our Investor Relations News Alert (in case you have subscribed to it) or if you decide to get in touch with us via email or phone. Legal basis for the processing is your consent, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (a) GDPR or our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to answer your questions, provide information and maintain our investor relations.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>II. Processing of personal data of shareholders and their representative&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>We may process your personal data such as your name, contact information, your email address, your representative, your intermediary bank, number of shares in connection with you purchasing shares in TeamViewer SE. Such information is used to fulfil our legal obligations (e.g. inform the regulatory bodies if shareholders reach certain levels of share ownership) as well as organize annual shareholder meetings (“&lt;b>Shareholder Meeting&lt;/b>”), including but not limited to preparing and sending out the invitations, issuing voting cards or respectively voting right tickets, compiling the list of participants and processing the power of attorneys. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>III. Processing of personal data in connection with Shareholder Meetings&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>We may conduct our Shareholder Meetings either in person or without presence using the means of remote communication (“&lt;b>virtual Shareholder Meeting&lt;/b>”) with the option of participating by an electronic connection.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>In order to enable shareholders and their representatives to participate in the Shareholder Meeting (e.g. by checking their eligibility to participate) and to exercise their rights at the Shareholder Meeting (including granting and revoking powers of attorney and instructions) as well as to ensure a proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting, the observance of voting bans, the lawful adoption of resolutions and evaluation of cast votes at the Shareholder Meeting, we may process the name, contact information, registration number, number of shares, voting behavior and results, submitted questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations, instructions and objections of our shareholders and their representatives, and login information for our designated shareholder portal (shareholder/voting card number and password). Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>The entire Shareholder Meeting may be broadcast live and publicly accessible on the Internet by means of video and audio transmission. If the Shareholder Meeting is conducted in person and you enter the recording area or make a verbal contribution during recording activities, this live broadcast will include your appearance and verbal contribution. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to enable interested shareholders and the public to follow the Shareholder Meeting via the Internet in accordance with the express permission in the German Stock Corporation Act and our by-laws.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Insofar as we take down in shorthand your verbal contributions during the Shareholder Meeting without being legally obliged to do so, this is done to ensure the proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting and to be able to deal with your questions and motions. The stenographic minutes will not be published. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to ensure that the Shareholder Meeting is executed properly and that our shareholders’ participation rights can be realized in the best possible way.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>If you make use of the opportunity to submit questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations or other requests that are dealt with or made available during or before the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name, which other participants of the Shareholder Meeting may take note of. If we are not legally obliged to state your name in this context, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to inform the other shareholders of the name of the applicant.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h3>IV. Processing of personal data in connection with the shareholder portal&lt;/h3>\r\n&lt;p>If we conduct the Shareholder Meeting virtually, the shareholders and their representatives will not be able to physically attend the meeting. They can, however, follow the entire meeting via video and audio transmission through the designated shareholder portal. In connection with the virtual Shareholder Meeting we will process your voting card number, log-in password, type of the power of attorney and personal data of your representative, as well as the instructions issued in connection with the Shareholder Meeting and any other information submitted by you in the shareholder portal. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>If we conduct a virtual Shareholder Meeting and provide the shareholder portal to enable you to conveniently manage your shareholder data, we will collect and process certain personal data on the web server log files, when you visit our shareholder portal in order to log in to attend the virtual Shareholder Meeting, manage your shareholder data or exercise your shareholder’s rights:&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;ul>\r\n&lt;li>Date and time of the request&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Notification whether the request was successful&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Requested URL&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page), if your browser sends this information&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Type of used web browser and operating system used&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>IP address&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Port by which the access was made&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Actions performed within the portal&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Session ID and data&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;li>Successful logins and logouts with the time stamp&lt;/li>\r\n&lt;/ul>\r\n&lt;p>Your browser automatically transfers this data to us when you visit our shareholder portal.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR, since we have a legitimate interest in making the shareholder portal available to you and your representatives so that you can exercise your shareholder rights in a user-friendly manner and participate in the virtual Shareholder Meeting.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h2>D. Cookies&lt;/h2>\r\n&lt;p>If we use cookies in the provision of the shareholder portal, we will only do so if this is necessary for the operation of the shareholder portal or if you have given your consent. In this case, when you visit the shareholder portal, we will inform you in a pop-up window about our cookies and associated data processing before using cookies and, if necessary, ask you for your voluntary consent.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h2>E. Data Sources&lt;/h2>\r\n&lt;p>If you are a shareholder, we receive your personal data either directly from you or from the custodian credit institutions or intermediaries who are involved in the deposit of shares you purchased.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>If you act as representative of a shareholder, we receive your personal data from the shareholder who granted you the power of attorney and directly from you as far as your behavior during the Shareholder Meeting or your use of the shareholder portal is concerned.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h2>F. Recipients&lt;/h2>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer SE’s employees, who administer, maintain and manage our internal processes, will have access to your personal data. To that end, TeamViewer SE has strong technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized disclosure to third parties and to ensure that only relevant individuals, who act within their job description and have a need-to-know interest in accessing any of your personal data, will have access to the data for which they have sufficient clearance.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Aside from TeamViewer SE’s employees, your personal data may be processed by employees of third-party services providers, who assist us in our daily business, such as providers of IT operation and maintenance services, (cloud) storage service providers and providers of (cloud) collaboration tools, as well as PR agencies. We use certain service providers in order to provide services typical for the capital market, such as EQS Group AG and Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. for the management of investor relations as well as Link Market Services GmbH for the management of shareholder relations and Shareholder Meetings. Link Market Services GmbH also operates the shareholder portal used for organizing virtual Shareholder Meetings, exclusively on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer SE selects all third-party service providers with due care, obligates them to confidentiality, and concludes data processing agreements (DPAs) with them (including the providers listed above) in accordance with the standards of the GDPR, as applicable. Should you have any questions about third parties we use, please contact us at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&#34;mailto:ir@teamviewer.com\&#34;>ir@teamviewer.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>In addition to above cases, your personal data may also be disclosed during or in connection with the Shareholder Meetings. If you, as a shareholder, make use of the opportunity to submit questions and your questions are dealt with during the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name. The above applies likewise regarding the submission of statements (in writing or via video message), the publication of which will show your name and, in the case of a statement via video message, images of yourself. If you submit items for the agenda, motions, counter-motions or nominations that we have to make publicly available, e.g. on our company’s website, before the Shareholder Meeting pursuant to our obligations under stock corporation law, this will also generally be done by stating your name. Other participants of the Shareholder Meeting or even the public may take note of this. Furthermore, other shareholders, their representatives where applicable or other participants of the meeting can view the personal data contained in the participant list during the Shareholder Meeting and, if applicable, up to two years thereafter in accordance with Sec. 129 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>TeamViewer SE will generally not transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, which include data transfers for group internal IT services provided from outside the EU, including Australia, USA and Armenia. TeamViewer SE will otherwise transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA only when required to do so by law or in case of orders from a competent authority. Currently we transfer personal data to our provider Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. in the US. Legal basis for such transfer is a DPA with EU standard contractual clauses.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Whenever TeamViewer SE transfers your personal data out of the EU or the EEA to countries that do not have an adequate level of data protection recognized by the EU, we will apply safeguards to adequately protect your personal data. In particular, we will conclude standard contractual clauses with corresponding entities and /.

We may be obliged to pass on your personal data to other recipients, such as when publishing voting rights notifications in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Trading Act, or to authorities in order to comply with statutory notification obligations (e.g. to financial or criminal prosecution authorities).&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h2>G. Retention periods for personal data&lt;/h2>\r\n&lt;p>Your personal data will be deleted once you withdraw consent, or once the purpose for processing has ceased to exist. In some cases, TeamViewer SE is legally obligated to retain data for a certain period of time. Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as they are no longer required for the purposes listed under Section C. and if the deleting or anonymizing does not conflict with legal requirements for proof and storage.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;h2>H.

<p>The entire Shareholder Meeting may be broadcast live and publicly accessible on the Internet by means of video and audio transmission. If the Shareholder Meeting is conducted in person and you enter the recording area or make a verbal contribution during recording activities, this live broadcast will include your appearance and verbal contribution. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to enable interested shareholders and the public to follow the Shareholder Meeting via the Internet in accordance with the express permission in the German Stock Corporation Act and our by-laws.</p>
<p>Insofar as we take down in shorthand your verbal contributions during the Shareholder Meeting without being legally obliged to do so, this is done to ensure the proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting and to be able to deal with your questions and motions. The stenographic minutes will not be published. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to ensure that the Shareholder Meeting is executed properly and that our shareholders’ participation rights can be realized in the best possible way.</p>
<p>If you make use of the opportunity to submit questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations or other requests that are dealt with or made available during or before the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name, which other participants of the Shareholder Meeting may take note of. If we are not legally obliged to state your name in this context, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to inform the other shareholders of the name of the applicant.</p>
<h3>IV. Processing of personal data in connection with the shareholder portal</h3>
<p>If we conduct the Shareholder Meeting virtually, the shareholders and their representatives will not be able to physically attend the meeting. They can, however, follow the entire meeting via video and audio transmission through the designated shareholder portal. In connection with the virtual Shareholder Meeting we will process your voting card number, log-in password, type of the power of attorney and personal data of your representative, as well as the instructions issued in connection with the Shareholder Meeting and any other information submitted by you in the shareholder portal. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.</p>
<p>If we conduct a virtual Shareholder Meeting and provide the shareholder portal to enable you to conveniently manage your shareholder data, we will collect and process certain personal data on the web server log files, when you visit our shareholder portal in order to log in to attend the virtual Shareholder Meeting, manage your shareholder data or exercise your shareholder’s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date and time of the request</li>
<li>Notification whether the request was successful</li>
<li>Requested URL</li>
<li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page), if your browser sends this information</li>
<li>Type of used web browser and operating system used</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Port by which the access was made</li>
<li>Actions performed within the portal</li>
<li>Session ID and data</li>
<li>Successful logins and logouts with the time stamp</li>
</ul>
<p>Your browser automatically transfers this data to us when you visit our shareholder portal.</p>
<p>Legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR, since we have a legitimate interest in making the shareholder portal available to you and your representatives so that you can exercise your shareholder rights in a user-friendly manner and participate in the virtual Shareholder Meeting.</p>
<h2>D. Cookies</h2>
<p>If we use cookies in the provision of the shareholder portal, we will only do so if this is necessary for the operation of the shareholder portal or if you have given your consent. In this case, when you visit the shareholder portal, we will inform you in a pop-up window about our cookies and associated data processing before using cookies and, if necessary, ask you for your voluntary consent.</p>
<h2>E. Data Sources</h2>
<p>If you are a shareholder, we receive your personal data either directly from you or from the custodian credit institutions or intermediaries who are involved in the deposit of shares you purchased.</p>
<p>If you act as representative of a shareholder, we receive your personal data from the shareholder who granted you the power of attorney and directly from you as far as your behavior during the Shareholder Meeting or your use of the shareholder portal is concerned.</p>
<h2>F. Recipients</h2>
<p>TeamViewer SE’s employees, who administer, maintain and manage our internal processes, will have access to your personal data. To that end, TeamViewer SE has strong technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized disclosure to third parties and to ensure that only relevant individuals, who act within their job description and have a need-to-know interest in accessing any of your personal data, will have access to the data for which they have sufficient clearance.</p>
<p>Aside from TeamViewer SE’s employees, your personal data may be processed by employees of third-party services providers, who assist us in our daily business, such as providers of IT operation and maintenance services, (cloud) storage service providers and providers of (cloud) collaboration tools, as well as PR agencies. We use certain service providers in order to provide services typical for the capital market, such as EQS Group AG and Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. for the management of investor relations as well as Link Market Services GmbH for the management of shareholder relations and Shareholder Meetings. Link Market Services GmbH also operates the shareholder portal used for organizing virtual Shareholder Meetings, exclusively on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>TeamViewer SE selects all third-party service providers with due care, obligates them to confidentiality, and concludes data processing agreements (DPAs) with them (including the providers listed above) in accordance with the standards of the GDPR, as applicable. Should you have any questions about third parties we use, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78110a380c1d19150e111d0f1d0a561b1715"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ee879cae9a8b8f8398878b998b9cc08d8183">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>In addition to above cases, your personal data may also be disclosed during or in connection with the Shareholder Meetings. If you, as a shareholder, make use of the opportunity to submit questions and your questions are dealt with during the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name. The above applies likewise regarding the submission of statements (in writing or via video message), the publication of which will show your name and, in the case of a statement via video message, images of yourself. If you submit items for the agenda, motions, counter-motions or nominations that we have to make publicly available, e.g. on our company’s website, before the Shareholder Meeting pursuant to our obligations under stock corporation law, this will also generally be done by stating your name. Other participants of the Shareholder Meeting or even the public may take note of this. Furthermore, other shareholders, their representatives where applicable or other participants of the meeting can view the personal data contained in the participant list during the Shareholder Meeting and, if applicable, up to two years thereafter in accordance with Sec. 129 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).</p>
<p>TeamViewer SE will generally not transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, which include data transfers for group internal IT services provided from outside the EU, including Australia, USA and Armenia. TeamViewer SE will otherwise transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA only when required to do so by law or in case of orders from a competent authority. Currently we transfer personal data to our provider Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. in the US. Legal basis for such transfer is a DPA with EU standard contractual clauses.</p>
<p>Whenever TeamViewer SE transfers your personal data out of the EU or the EEA to countries that do not have an adequate level of data protection recognized by the EU, we will apply safeguards to adequately protect your personal data. In particular, we will conclude standard contractual clauses with corresponding entities and /. Please refer to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en</a> to obtain further information on the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established outside the EU or the EEA.</p>
<p>We will not share your personal data with local authorities or courts except where we are required to do so by applicable law, a court order or a legally binding injunction. We may be obliged to pass on your personal data to other recipients, such as when publishing voting rights notifications in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Trading Act, or to authorities in order to comply with statutory notification obligations (e.g. to financial or criminal prosecution authorities).</p>
<h2>G. Retention periods for personal data</h2>
<p>Your personal data will be deleted once you withdraw consent, or once the purpose for processing has ceased to exist. In some cases, TeamViewer SE is legally obligated to retain data for a certain period of time. Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as they are no longer required for the purposes listed under Section C. and if the deleting or anonymizing does not conflict with legal requirements for proof and storage.</p>
<h2>H. Statutory/contractual requirement</h2>
<p>You may choose not to provide your personal data or provide incomplete personal data. However, by not providing your personal data, we may not be able to provide you with the relevant service or support, e.g. enable you to participate in our Shareholder Meeting or use all of the functionalities of our website; where we ask for consent and you choose not to provide it, or you block, disable or delete cookies, we may not be able to provide you with the information or service requested.</p>
<h2>I. Your rights</h2>
