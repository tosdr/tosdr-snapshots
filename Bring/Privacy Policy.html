The information about your use of the website generated by Google Analytics cookies is normally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. On this website Google Analytics was expanded by the code &quot;gat._anonymizeIp();&quot; in order to ensure the anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). Thus your IP address is abbreviated beforehand by Google within the EU Member States or other Member States or the European Economic Area.<br/><br/>The complete IP address is transferred to a Google server in the USA only in rare cases and then abbreviated there. Google will use this information in order to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports about the website activities for the website operators and to provide additional services related to your website and Internet use.<br/><br/>The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not linked to any other data stored by Google.

It installs an opt-out cookie which will prevent the future collection of your data when visiting this website: <a href="http://about:blank">deactivate Google Analytics</a>.<br/><br/>You will find more information about the conditions of use and about data protection under <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html</a> bzw. unter <a href="https://www.google.eom/intl/en/policies/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong></h3><p>We use Firebase Analytics from Google Inc. to analyse user behaviour.
