<h4>C. Awarding and Redeeming Points</h4>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">A. Awarding Points</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In General.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">The Application indicates those activities for which you may be awarded points, and the applicable number of points you may be awarded for those activities. Activities may be added or deleted from the Application by Airfind in our sole discretion. You must properly and completely engage in the applicable activity in order to be awarded the associated points. Airfind will award points in its discretion. You must be in compliance with this Agreement in order to be awarded points. Points will not be added to your Account if you un-install the Application or you or we de-activate or cancel your Account.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being an Active Daily User.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">You must be an Active Daily User of the Application to be eligible to be awarded points. An “Active Daily User” means that you keep the Application running on your device at all times, you use your device as you normally would, you view Lock Screen Content (as defined below) as part of your normal interactions with your device, and you have only one Account.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points for Content On Your Lock Screen.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Once you download the Application and accept this Agreement, the Application allows third party businesses and advertisers (collectively, Third Party Advertisers), as well as Airfind, to deliver advertisements and other content on the lock screen of your mobile device (collectively, Lock Screen Content). You will have the option to ignore any Lock Screen Content or to click on it to receive more information about the Lock Screen Content you see on your lock screen. The Lock Screen Content will appear anytime you wake up your device. By allowing the display of this Lock Screen Content, you will be eligible to be awarded the points as described in this Agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points for Surveys.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">The Application may allow you to answer short market research surveys in order to be eligible to be awarded points. You will be notified in the Application when surveys are available. If for any reason a survey is not fully completed (including, without limitation, as a result of a network or device error), you will not be eligible to receive points for taking the survey. The surveys are provided by third parties, and not Airfind. You will need to review the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the survey provider (or providers) before completing any surveys. Airfind does not guarantee that surveys will always be available or that they will be available at any specific times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus Points.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Airfind reserves the right to grant bonus points in our discretion for special activities or events. You will be notified of any bonus point opportunities or awards in the Application or another notification manner contemplated by this Agreement.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">B. Redeeming Points</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Subject to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this section, once awarded, you may redeem points through purchases at any time, so long as (i) you have enough points available to purchase a reward (a Redemption Purchase) and (ii) your Account is open, active and in good standing. However, your first Redemption Purchase may be prohibited during a one-time waiting period which is based on the number of days that you must use the Application after you first create your Account. This waiting period will be set by Airfind in our discretion and identified in the Application if you attempt to make a Redemption Purchase prior to the end of the waiting period.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The number of points required to redeem an item shall be set by Airfind from time to time in our sole discretion, and may change without notice. The available rewards (and required points for the same) can be seen in the Application. Based on your point total, you may choose to redeem your points for available rewards or you may continue building points to redeem later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Some reward products and services may have restrictions, such as limited availability, may be available only while supplies last and/or may be subject to other restrictions. We will explain those restrictions to you within the Application.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">When you make a Redemption Purchase, you may be purchasing a product or service (collectively, Redemption Products) from a third party affiliated with the Application (a Reward Third Party and, collectively, the Reward Third Parties). The Reward Third Parties may have additional terms and conditions that are applicable to your Redemption Purchase. If so, those additional terms and conditions will be presented to you for review and acceptance in the Application (and will apply in addition to this Agreement). If you do not accept the additional terms and conditions of a Reward Third Party that are presented to you, you will not be able to redeem your points for Redemption Products of that Reward Third Party.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">C. Expiration of Points</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Points expire 12 months after they are awarded, on a rolling basis. However, points may expire earlier if (and when) your Account is closed, if that occurs prior to the 12-month expiration date. Information about expiring points is available in the Application.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">D. Inactivity; Account Closure; Other Loss of Points</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If we close or deactivate your Account as described in “Terms of Use &#8211; Registration; Your Account” above, or you voluntarily close your Account, your accumulated points will immediately expire. Airfind, in our sole discretion, can freeze or remove points from your Account and/or suspend and cancel your Account activity (including any pending Redemption Purchases) if Airfind has reason to believe that points were awarded through means that are in violation of this Agreement or fraudulent or illegal activity. You will be notified of any freezing or removal of points.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">E. Points Have No Cash Value</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Points awarded may only be redeemed within the Application. Points are not your personal property and are not descendible or transferable, and may not be inherited, bartered, sold or given. Points are not actual currency and have no cash value. Reward points may be valued by Airfind for tax and accounting purposes in our sole discretion.</p>
<h4><strong>D. Return or Cancellation of Redemption Products</strong></h4>
<p>The handling of returns or cancellations of Redemption Products, including if they are lost or stolen, is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Reward Third Party. You should contact the applicable Reward Third Party directly with any questions about returns, cancellations or lost or stolen items. Their contact information will accompany the details of your Redemption Purchase.</p>
<h4><strong>E. Delivery of Your Redemption Purchase</strong></h4>
<p>Products and services purchased in a Redemption Purchase will be delivered virtually to you through the Application, unless otherwise noted in the Application.</p>
<h4><strong>F. Tax Matters</strong></h4>
<p>Your use of the Application may result in the receipt of taxable income by you from Airfind in the tax year(s) in which you redeem your points. In accordance with U.S. tax law, Airfind may be required to send to you, and file with the IRS, a Form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income) for the year(s) in which you redeem points. The valuation of the points that you redeem for Form 1099-MISC tax reporting purposes will be at Airfind’s sole discretion. You are solely responsible for any personal tax liability arising out of the points redeemed through your use of the Application. Please consult with your tax advisor if you have any questions regarding your personal tax situation.</p>
<h4><strong>G. Changes in Points</strong></h4>
<p>Airfind may change the points that may be awarded through the Application at any time. In the event of a change in points, Airfind will include updated information about the points that you are eligible to be awarded within the Application. If you do not agree to these changes, your sole remedy is to stop using the Application before the changes take place. If you continue to use the Application after a change in the points has taken effect, you will be deemed to have agreed to the change. Any such change will only apply prospectively and will not affect previously awarded points.</p>

<p>This Agreement and the relationship between you and Airfind shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, excluding any conflicts of law provisions. Airfind does not consent to the jurisdiction of all states or state courts merely by virtue of maintaining and operating the Services and providing other content and information on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The failure of Airfind to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of Airfind thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#8217; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<p>The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
<p>Any notices intended to have legal effect: (a) to you may be made via email, SMS, regular mail or through the Services or the Application and (b) to Airfind must be made by delivery receipt-requested mail at Airfind headquarters at 3401 N. Miami Ave, Suite 230, Miami, FL 33127, ATTN: Legal Department.</p>
<p>The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the intention of the parties, with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect.</p>
<p>This Agreement (together with all Related Agreements) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.</p>
<p>The failure of Airfind to comply with this Agreement because of any reason beyond the reasonable control of Airfind shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.</p>
