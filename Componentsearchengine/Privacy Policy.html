SamacSys, Ltd. (“SamacSys,” “we,” or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of
personal information very seriously. This privacy policy (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>”)
describes the privacy practices of SamacSys in connection with the website
we own or control (“<b>Sites</b>”) and services made available through the Sites
(“<b>Services</b>”) and together with the Sites, the “<b>SamacSys Offerings</b>”).
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings
assigned to such terms in the SamacSys Terms of Service that you can find at
<a href="https://supplyframe.com/company/terms">https://supplyframe.com/company/terms</a> and which incorporate this
Privacy Policy by reference.
</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any personal information hereunder is entirely voluntary. However, if you choose not to allow SamacSys to use your personal information, there may be certain circumstances in which SamacSys may be unable to provide you with certain Services, such as processing your orders or providing you with access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for SamacSys to provide you with what you request without the relevant personal information.
</p>
<h2>Cross-Border Data Transfer</h2>
<p>
As part of a global group of companies, SamacSys has affiliates and third-party service providers within, as well as outside of, the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). As a consequence, whenever SamacSys is using or otherwise processing your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, SamacSys may transfer your personal information to countries outside of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your personal information is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA.
</p>
<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>
European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located within the European Union, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

<li><b>Correct.</b> Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Delete your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Transfer.</b> Transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.</li>
<li><b>Restrict.</b> Restrict the processing of your personal information.</li>
<li><b>Object.</b> Object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your personal information that impacts your rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You may submit these requests by email to <a href = "mailto: legal@SamacSys.com">legal@SamacSys.com</a> or our postal address provided below.
We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request.
If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response
to your requests regarding your personal information, you may <a href='https://www.samacsys.com/aboutus/contactus/'>contact</a> us or submit a complaint to the
data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.
You can find your data protection regulator <a href='https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en'>here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Right To Lodge A Complaint</h2>
<p>
If you believe that SamacSys is not processing your personal information in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which SamacSys has its registered seat.
</p>
<h2>Data Controller</h2>
<p>
The data controller of www.SamacSys.com is SamacSys Ltd, 20-21 Market Place, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, OX10 0AD, United Kingdom (“SamacSys”). SamacSys’s data protection officer is Carey Sayer.  (<a href = "mailto: legal@SamacSys.com">legal@SamacSys.com</a>).

<p>
We may receive personal information about you from outside the Sites, such as from third parties that provide services for us that are related to the SamacSys Offerings. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the SamacSys Offerings.
</p>
<h2>Use Of Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
In general, information (including personal information) you submit to us, or to third parties that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide you and others with the SamacSys Offerings, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our SamacSys Offerings, and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the SamacSys Offerings.
</p>
<p>
We may also use your personal information to provide you with notifications related to your use of the SamacSys Offerings, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails.
</p>
<p>
SamacSys may share User data with other Companies giving them access to personal information for commercial follow-up purposes. By accessing our content users authorize SamacSys to transmit their personal information to other Companies and acknowledge that the data will be processed by them in accordance with their own data privacy policies.
</p>

We may also create Anonymous Information on how you use the SamacSys Offerings. We may use this Anonymous Information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the SamacSys Offerings, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose any Anonymous Information at our discretion.
</p>
<h2> Use of Personal Data Based on the Law</h2>
<p>
In the following cases, SamacSys is permitted to process your personal information under the applicable data protection law.
</p>
<p>
<i>Providing the requested goods or services.</i> If you order goods or services from SamacSys, we will use the personal information that you enter into the order or registration form (usually a subset of your name, email address, telephone number, company name and address, your job title and role and, if payment is to be made to SamacSys, credit card number or bank details) only to process your order or to provide the requested goods or service. This may include taking the necessary steps prior to entering into the contract, responding to your related inquiries, and providing you with shipping and billing information, and to process or provide customer feedback and support. This may also include conversation data that you may trigger via the chat functionalities on our Sites, contact forms, emails, or telephone. In this Privacy Policy, “goods and services” includes (access to) SamacSys Offerings, contests, sweepstakes, other content, non-marketing related newsletters, whitepapers, tutorials, trainings and events.
</p>
<p>
If you participate in tutorials or trainings provided by SamacSys, we may also track your learning progress in order to make this information available to you. Furthermore, we communicate on a regular basis by email with users who subscribe to our services, and we may also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We may use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, which are not marketing-related but merely required for the relevant business relationship. With regard to marketing-related types of communication (i.e. emails and phone calls), SamacSys will provide you the opportunity to opt out if you do not want to receive further marketing-related types of communication from us.
</p>
<p>
SamacSys and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries, SamacSys is required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through SamacSys Sites or other delivery channels controlled by SamacSys. This may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to SamacSys’s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, you acknowledge that any information required to track your choices regarding the processing or use of your personal information or receipt of marketing materials (that is to say, depending on the country in which the relevant SamacSys company operates, whether you have expressly consented to or opted out of receiving marketing materials) may be stored and exchanged between members of SamacSys as required to ensure compliance.
</p>
<h2>Uses Of My Personal Information Based On My Consent</h2>
<p>
SamacSys may provide a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google) where this information is then matched against the social networks’ data or the web offerings’ own data bases in order to display to you more relevant information.
</p>
<p>
SamacSys offers you the option to use its Offerings including forums, blogs, and networks linked to its Sites that require you to register and create a user profile. User profiles provide the option to display personal information about you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company.
</p>
<p>
These profiles may relate to a single Offering of SamacSys or may also allow you to access other Offerings of SamacSys or of other entities of SamacSys, or both (irrespective of any consent granted under the section “Forwarding Your Personal Data To Other SamacSys Companies.” below). It is, however, always your choice which of these additional Offerings you use and your personal information is only forwarded to them once you initially access them. Kindly note that without your consent for SamacSys to create such user profiles, SamacSys will not be in a position to offer such services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that SamacSys can provide these services to you.
</p>
<p>
Within any Offerings, beyond the mere provision of access, your profile is used to personalize interaction with other users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and by SamacSys to foster the quality of communication and collaboration through such Offerings and for SamacSys to provide gamification elements (gamification is the process of taking something that already exists, such as a website, an enterprise application, or an online community, and integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty). To the greatest extent supported by the relevant Offerings, you can use the functionality of the relevant Offerings to determine which information you want to share.

In connection with the registration for and provision of access to an event or seminar, SamacSys may ask for information about your health for the purpose of identifying and being considerate of individuals who have disabilities or special dietary requirements throughout the event. Any such use of information is based on the consent you grant hereunder.
</p>
<p>
Kindly note that if you do not provide any such information about disabilities or special dietary requirements, SamacSys will not be able to take any respective precautions.
</p>
<p>
If you register for an event, seminar, or webinar of SamacSys, SamacSys may share basic participant information (your name, company, and email address) with other participants of the same event, seminar, or webinar for the purpose of communication and the exchange of ideas.
</p>
<p>
SamacSys may transfer your personal information to other entities owned by SamacSys. In such cases, these entities will then use the personal information for the same purposes and under the same conditions as outlined in this section.
</p>
<p>
You may at any time withdraw a consent granted.  In case of withdrawal, SamacSys will not process personal information subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case SamacSys is required to retain your personal information for legal reasons your personal information will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law. However, any withdrawal has no effect on past processing of personal information by SamacSys up to the point in time of your withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of an SamacSys Offering requires your prior consent, SamacSys will not be (any longer) able to provide the relevant service, offer or event to you after your revocation.

We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Service, the Terms of Service, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you may have with us. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your Account information (and associated Content) from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the SamacSys Offerings.

When we delete personal information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.
</p>
<h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>
The SamacSys Offerings may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by SamacSys. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such web sites or location or its contents.

<h2>Security and Confidentiality</h2>

<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>
Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to us via email at <a href = "mailto: privacy@supplyframe.com">privacy@supplyframe.com</a>. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in your request and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
</p>
<h2>Important Information for California Residents</h2>
<p>
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.  For purposes of this section, “<b>Personal Information</b>” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<b>CCPA</b>”) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
</p>
<h3>Your California privacy rights.</h3>
<p>
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Information.</b> You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:
<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>
<li>The categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Access.</b> You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</li>
<li><b>Deletion.</b> You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>
<li><b>Opt-out of sales.</b> If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li><b>Nondiscrimination.</b> You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by the CCPA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to exercise your rights</h3>
<p>You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Right to information, access and deletion.</b> You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights by:
<ul>
<li>visiting https://componentsearchengine.com/</li>
<li>calling us toll free at 1-866-786-8339</li>
<li>emailing legal@supplyframe.com</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information.</b> We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. California law classifies our use of these services as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services. This is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads more likely to interest you. You can request to opt-out out of this “sale” of your personal information here: <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="j-opt-out-link">Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>
<p>We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require government identification, a declaration under penalty of perjury or other information. Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity, and provide us with confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>
<h3>Personal information that we collect, use and share</h3>
