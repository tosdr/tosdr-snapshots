Location and Territorial Restrictions</h3><p>TV Time is not intended for distribution in or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject WNI to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.</p><p>WNI controls and operates TV Time from offices located in the United States and makes no representations or warranties that the information, products, or services contained in TV Time are appropriate for use or access in other locations. Anyone using or accessing TV Time from other locations does so on their own initiative and is responsible for compliance with United States and local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent such laws are applicable.

Binding Arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”)</h3><p>The dispute resolution provisions of this Section 12 are voluntary for residents of countries other than the United States. If you are a U.S. resident, the provisions of this Section 12 are binding.</p><ul><li><p>a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of TV Time, to these Terms, or to any aspect of your relationship with WNI, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or WNI may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). You agree that you must commence any arbitration or other claim within one (1) year after the dispute arises, otherwise the claim is permanently barred, which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the dispute. This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of these Terms or any prior version of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>If you agree to arbitration with WNI, you are agreeing in advance that you will not participate in or seek to recover monetary or other relief in any lawsuit filed against the WNI Parties alleging class, collective, and/or representative claims on your behalf. Instead, by agreeing to arbitration, you may bring your claims against the WNI Parties in an individual arbitration proceeding (except for any Batch Arbitration, as described below). If successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other relief by an arbitrator. You acknowledge that you have been advised that you may consult with an attorney in deciding whether to accept this agreement, including this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p></li><li><p>b. Process. To begin a claim, you must first send a letter describing your claim in detail, including your name and contact information, your legal claim, the specific facts giving rise to your claim (including the date(s) and amount(s) of any relevant transaction or interaction with us), and the requested relief) to Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. You and we agree to attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution of your claim. If a resolution is not reached within thirty (30) days, you may commence an arbitration action as set forth herein. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&#x27; fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS&#x27;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims will be subject to JAMS&#x27;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at<!-- --> <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS&#x27;s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. WNI will be entitled to make an offer of judgment in the arbitration proceeding. If the offer of judgment is not accepted, and the award is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, you will be solely responsible for all costs incurred by WNI after the offer of judgment is made to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p></li><li><p>c. Fees. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS&#x27;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, WNI will pay them for you. If the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, you agree to pay WNI’s attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p></li><li><p>d. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and WNI. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&#x27;s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p></li><li><p>e. Waiver of Jury Trial. You and WNI hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and WNI are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 12(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p></li><li><p>f. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. Except with respect to Batch Arbitration (as defined below), all claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, only individual relief is available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 15.</p><p>You and WNI agree that, in the event that there are fifty (50) or more individual requests for arbitration of a similar nature filed against WNI within an approximately (30) thirty-day period (or otherwise in close proximity) regardless of the state(s) in which such claims are filed, JAMS will administer all such similarly situated arbitration demands on a collective basis as a single, consolidated arbitration (subject to a single set of fees, proceeding schedule, and, if required, hearing) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the requirements outlined elsewhere in this section, provided that – in the event that the arbitrator deems it impracticable or inequitable to administer all such claims collectively in a single arbitration – (s)he may group demands for arbitration into groups of not fewer than twenty (20) matters, plus a remainder group as needed (or as otherwise deemed by the arbitrator to be practicable, equitable, and in best keeping with the spirit of this provision) and arbitrate each group of matters as a single, consolidated arbitration (either structure a “<strong>Batch Arbitration</strong>”). You and WNI agree (1) to work with JAMS in good faith to facilitate the resolution of disputes on a Batch Arbitration basis and (2) that requests for arbitration are of a “similar nature” if they arise out of the same event, agreement, or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. Disagreements over the applicability of this Batch Arbitration process will be settled in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding that includes all affected parties and is resolved by a single arbitrator subject to the requirements of this section. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class or collective arbitration or action of any kind, or any suit or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims, under any circumstances other than those expressly set forth in this section.</p></li><li><p>g. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out by contacting us at Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404 or legal@whipmedia.com within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your TV Time username (if any), the email address you used to set up your TV Time account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p></li><li><p>h. Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</p></li><li><p>i. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with WNI.</p></li><li><p>j. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if WNI makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice to WNI.</p></li></ul><h3 id="toc_13">13.
