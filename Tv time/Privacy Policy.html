Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h3><p>We may collect information from you both directly and automatically when you use TV Time. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name and email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification process satisfies legal requirements. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.</p><p>We collect information in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Information You Submit Via TV Time</strong>. In the course of using TV Time, you may provide us with certain information, including contact information (such as your name, email address, and social media username); information about your interests and preferences (such as your favorites and the episodes that you have watched); account information (such as your profile picture, username, and birthday); and demographic information (such as your gender and the country you are from). Some features may allow you to view, create, reproduce, submit, display, perform, and/or share content, which includes videos, audio, images, graphics, written posts, comments, and other forms of multimedia (collectively, “User Content”).</p></li><li><p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically From Your Use of TV Time</strong>. When you use TV Time, we, our third-party service providers, and our business partners may automatically collect certain information (“Usage Information”). One of the ways we collect Usage information is when you visit portions of TV Time, our servers automatically generate logs to help us determine how people travel through TV Time and to improve our services. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as personal information. This Usage Information includes your IP address and unique device identifiers (“Device IDs”) for your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access TV Time. A Device ID is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device ID. We will also collect and track other data and information relating to your device, including entertainment-specific and/or streaming applications on your device, the Internet service provider you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the type of browser you use. We track your activities on TV Time such as the pages and content you access and your interactions with the content we provide. We may be able to infer your approximate location based on your IP address or similar information we collect.</p></li></ul><p>We use the following types of tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) to automatically collect information when you interact with us online:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cookies and Local Storage</strong> are small text files stored locally on your device that help store user preferences. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a device to us to recognize the device whenever the device is used to visit TV Time. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers, and our third-party business partners, such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to you online, and remembering your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on TV Time, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through TV Time, and to personalize your experience through TV Time, such as to recognize you when you return to TV Time. The information we store includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at<!-- --> <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs and pixel tags)</strong> <!-- -->are small pieces of code used to collect usage analytics. They help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we will use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened.</p><p>We use similar tools to collect such information from mobile devices. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Information from Third Parties</strong>. We may receive information about you from third parties, such as data providers who enhance the information we have about you, publicly available information, or third parties that you integrate into TV Time, such as social media platforms or streaming services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media and Other Third Party Platforms</strong>. We may permit you to interact with social media and other third party platforms, including Google, Apple, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. When you interact with third party platforms through TV Time, we will receive information about you. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or &quot;friends.&quot; The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. We or the third party may allow you to disable or remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.<!-- --> </p><p>If you choose to post information to a third party platform, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of TV Time. You may also choose to participate in a way that connects that third-party service with TV Time, such as posting to one of our pages on a social media site or sharing your watch history from a streaming service with us. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information, and the third party may allow us to re-post content related to us on our own services.</p><p>In addition, these third parties may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of TV Time, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on TV Time. Certain third-party platforms may be able to collect certain information on your visits to TV Time regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties that control platforms you post to or that connect to TV Time and set your privacy preferences with them.</p></li></ul><h3 id="toc_2">2.
