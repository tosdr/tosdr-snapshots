Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims. Processes for dispute resolution will apply even if you stop using your Account, delete your Account, or stop using the Service. They will also apply to disputes that arose before we entered into this agreement.</span></p><p><b><span>Sections 8.1 to 8.6 apply to you if you are a resident of the United States or Canada. They do not apply to you if you are a resident of any other country.</span></b></p><h4><span>8.1. Informal Dispute Resolution</span></h4><p><span>You must try to informally resolve any dispute directly with Supercell for at least thirty (30) days before you start an arbitration. The informal dispute resolution process starts when you give Supercell written notice of the dispute through legal-requests@supercell.com.</span></p><h4><span>8.2. Arbitration </span></h4><p><span>Agreement You and Supercell agree to resolve any disputes exclusively in final and binding arbitration as follows:</span></p><p><span>Either you or Supercell may choose to submit any dispute for resolution exclusively by final and binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described below. If you or Supercell brings a claim in court that can be resolved by arbitration under this section, then either party can ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of Section 8 (“Dispute Resolution”) is valid or enforceable, or whether it applies to a claim.</span></p><p><span>An arbitration proceeding will be held before a neutral arbitrator. This means </span><b><span>you and Supercell agree to give up the right to resolve the dispute in a trial before a judge or jury.</span></b><span> Arbitration has different rules than more formal lawsuits. For example, the ability to force the other side to share information may be more limited than the process called discovery in formal lawsuits. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final. You or Supercell can ask the arbitrator to put a decision or award and the reasons for it in writing. Either of us can ask a court to confirm or enter the arbitrator’s final decision or award, which will make it the same as a court judgment. You and Supercell will generally not be able to change the outcome of arbitration through courts outside of very limited circumstances. </span></p><h4><span>8.3. Arbitration Process</span></h4><p><span>The arbitration will be run by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). AAA’s rules and procedures will be used for the arbitration, including the Consumer Arbitration Rules. But if there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms of Service. To review AAA’s Rules or to start arbitration, you can go to </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adr.org/"><span>AAA’s website</span></a><span>. If either of us decide to start arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.</span></p><p><span>The fees for arbitration will be determined by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitrator decides that those fees are excessive, Supercell will pay the fees. Each side will pay their own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the claims allow for to the prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the applicable law. If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of the arbitrator’s decision or award through a subsequent court case, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.</span></p><p><span>The arbitration will take place either in San Francisco, California, USA or in the county or province where you reside.</span></p><h4><span>8.4 Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</span></h4><p><span>You and Supercell agree that the arbitration agreement in Section 8.2 will not apply to the following disputes:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Claims about Supercell’s intellectual property, such as claims to enforce, protect, or concerning the validity of Supercell’s copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Claims related to piracy or tortious interference.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Claims that are not subject to an arbitration agreement as a matter of law and are not preempted by federal law that would allow for an agreement to arbitration.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Claims in small claims court.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Any dispute not subject to arbitration under these exceptions shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction as described in Section 10 (“Venue for Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration”).</span></p><h4><span>8.5 No Class Actions</span></h4><p><span>You and Supercell agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.That means:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>You cannot bring a claim against Supercell as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The arbitrator cannot combine any other person’s claims with yours into a single case or preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The arbitrator’s decision or award in your case will not apply to anyone else and cannot be used to decide other people’s disputes.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>If this section (Section 8.5 “No Class Actions”) is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then the entirety of Section 8, including Sections 8.1 to 8.6, shall be void.</span></p><h4><span>8.6 Opt-Out of Arbitration Agreement and No Class Actions Provisions</span></h4><p><span>You can choose to opt out of and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and No Class Action provisions above (Sections 8.1 to 8.5) by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal-requests@supercell.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” You must send us this notice within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later.
