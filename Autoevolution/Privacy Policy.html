<h3>Disclosures of your personal data</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>International transfers</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Data security</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Data retention</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “request erasure” below for further information.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="gdpr">Specific legal rights for users located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area" target="_blank">EEA region</a> (GDPR)</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">You may contact our data protection officer at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bbdfcbd4e4dadefbc8d4ddcfd5deccc895c9d4">[email&#160;protected]</a> for more information or to exercise any of these rights:</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">1. Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">2. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">3. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">4. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">5. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">6. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>

<b>Exercising these rights</b><br>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">Use our <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/dsr/">DSR (data subject request) form</a> or send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e387938cbc8286a3908c85978d869490cd918c">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ro/" target="_blank">ANSPDCP</a>, the Romanian supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns about data protection before you approach the authority so please contact us in the first instance.</p>

<b>No fee usually required</b><br>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).</p>

<b>What we may need from you</b><br>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<b>Time limit to respond</b><br>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="ccpa">Specific legal rights for users located in California, United States of America (CCPA)</h3>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. (“CCPA”), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described below.</p>

<p class="legible">1. California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3a5e4a55655b5f7a49555c4e545f4d49144855">[email&#160;protected]</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information;</li>
	<li>Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold;</li>
	<li>Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions;</li>
	<li>Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights</li>
</ul>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">2. California residents also have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their Personal Information. We put “sale” in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as “sales,” even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. <!--California residents can exercise this right here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information-->. If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t “sales,” such as with our Service Providers.</p>

<p class="legible">3. Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a “business purpose” (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifiers</li>
	<li>Commercial information</li>
	<li>Geolocation data</li>
	<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
	<li>Professional information</li>
	<li>Education information</li>
	<li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li>
</ul>

<p class="legible">4. Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have “sold” (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifiers</li>
	<li>Commercial information</li>
	<li>Geolocation data</li>
	<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
	<li>Professional information</li>
	<li>Education information</li>
	<li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li>
</ul>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">5. You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">6. You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any of your rights.</p>

<p class="legible mgbot_20">7. California's "Shine the Light" law permits customers who are California residents to request certain details about how a business shares their personal information as defined by "Shine the Light" with third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for those third parties' or affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. California customers may request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us by e-mail at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2f4b5f40704e4a6f5c40495b414a585c015d40">[email&#160;protected]</a> or by mail at the address set forth in Section 11 above. Any mail inquiry must include "California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email or mail address.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Identity providers</h3>
<p class="legible mgbot_20">Depending on your consent and/or opt-outs, the following third-party services may use personal data or other information that we may collect from you, if provided, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), IP address, and/or information about your browser or operating system, to create an ID for the purpose of recognising you on your devices. <u>This ID does not contain any of your identifiable personal data.</u> We may place this ID in our first-party cookie and allow it to be used for online and cross-channel advertising. This ID may be shared by us or on our behalf with our advertising partners and other third-party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content and/or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. web, email, connected devices, in-app, etc).
