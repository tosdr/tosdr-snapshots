If you have arrived at this Privacy Policy by "clicking" on an authorized link from a Site, then this Privacy Policy applies to such Site.</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website owned and/or operated by or on behalf of any third party even if we provide a link to such website on one of our Sites.</p><p>When we refer to "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>," we mean SP Plus Corporation, a Delaware corporation, or the specific division, subsidiary, or affiliate that operates the Site, provides its content, or processes information received through it, each as appropriate and applicable.</p><p>When we refer to "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>," we mean the person accessing the Site. If the person accessing the Site acts on behalf of, or for the purposes of, another person, including a business or other organization, "you" or "your" also means that other person, including a business organization.</p><p>We created this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect Personal Information, what information we collect, how we use it, the steps we take to safeguard it, and the choices you have regarding how it may be used and disclosed. Please note that we do not necessarily collect all of the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy for all users or engage in all of the means of collecting or using Personal Information we describe.  No description of any type of information, means of collecting Personal Information, or use of information will require us to collect any particular Personal Information, make any particular use of any Personal Information, or offer any particular functionality.</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact between us and you. This Privacy Policy does not cover information we collect by means other than the Sites. If you have any questions about how we use information collected by means other than the Sites, you should inquire at or before the time you give such information to us.</p><p>Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. Each time you visit the Sites or provide us with Personal Information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.</p><p>Note that this Privacy Policy contains several important exceptions.  Please read the entire Privacy Policy to be sure that you understand these exceptions.</p><h3>Information Ownership</h3><p>We, or the entity on whose behalf we operate a Site, own the information collected through the Sites.  </p><h3>Information We Collect From You</h3><p>In order to operate the Sites and provide you with information, products and services that may be requested by or of interest to you, we may collect and retain "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" which means information that could be used to contact you such as full name, postal address, phone number, email address, and license plate number(s), information you provide to pay for our services such as your credit and debit card numbers, bank or financial institution account numbers, billing address, purchase history information about the services your purchase when using the Sites, the services that you use or purchase on the Sites such as the type of parking permit you purchase, the location of the facility, the type of your vehicle, and your destination or venue if provided.</p><h3>Your IP Address</h3><p>Each time you visit the Site(s), we automatically collect your internet protocol (IP) address and the web page from which you came. We use your IP address to administer and optimize the Sites for you and diagnose problems with the Sites. We may also supplement your IP address with anonymous Site traffic information that's collected automatically when you visit the Site(s), plus with information acquired from our joint marketing partners, from third parties, and from our affiliated companies.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>We may use "cookies" in connection with operation of the Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the computer that runs an Internet browser and is commonly used to store information about a consumer's online activities, including information such as the content or advertisements that a consumer views or the pages a consumer visits within a particular website. It can contain information about you, your computer, your browser, your session, the websites you visit, and other information about you or others who use, or have used, the computer or browser you use to access the Internet. Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes: the stored information can be retrieved by our website server when you return to the Site(s). This allows us to personalize or regulate the use of the Sites, and also permits us to automate the access and data-entry functions of the Sites (e.g., login information), to store online ordering information for purchases you may make while visiting the Site(s), and to tailor the appearance or presentation of the Site(s) to your preferences or interests. The cookies we use, if any, are not linked to any Personal Information while using the Sites unless: (i) you have given us permission to link such Personal Information to one or more cookies or (ii) you login or register with the Site. You give us that permission any time you register on the Sites or place an order through the Sites.</p><p>We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how the Sites are used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at the Site(s) or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to the Site(s)). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services and targeted advertising. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. Most or all browsers permit you to disable or reject cookies. You can do this by setting the preferences in the browser. Use the "help" feature of your browser to obtain more information about refusing cookies. If you set the browser you use to reject cookies, you may not be able to access the Sites, use the full functionality of the Sites, or it may take additional time to utilize such functionality. If you opt to reject cookies, you may need to sign in with us each time you visit the Site(s).</p><p>Companies that advertise on the Sites (and their agents), one or more of the organizations with which we do business, or to which we provide links from the Sites, might use their own cookies. We have no control over such organizations' uses of cookies and users should review the privacy policies of such organizations to determine the uses such organizations make of cookies. This Privacy Policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.</p><h3>Log Files</h3><p>We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and Site improvement. When you access the Site(s), we or our hosting provider may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server. Log file information may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We or our hosting provider use this information to analyze trends, administer sites, track users' movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. Our hosting provider and we may review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular and useful to users.</p><h3>Information Other Websites Collect From You</h3><p>The Sites may contain links to other websites operated by other parties whose practices may be different than ours. When you click on these links and visit these other websites, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or these other websites' business practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Sites. You should check the other websites' privacy notices since we have no control over information that is submitted to or collected by them. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p><h3>How We Use and Share Personal Information</h3><p>We use your Personal Information to help us perform transactions, to deliver the services you have requested, to contact you when necessary in connection with events for which you purchased a parking permit(s) on the Sites (including event confirmations, changes, cancellations, and updates in general), to provide you with account login credentials, and to send you information, offers and other promotional materials from us and selected third parties. We may additionally use your Personal Information to aggregate, perform analysis, determine consumer trends, data-mine or otherwise improve the services that we provide. We may also share anonymized, aggregated information derived from Personal Information with advertisers and other third parties.</p><p>We use any financial information you provide as part of your Personal Information to process your order, check your qualifications, bill you for products and services, and enable you to participate in discount, automated billing, and similar programs.  By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity that uses financial information on the Sites, you consent to our providing your Personal Information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine necessary to process your transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process the transaction.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances of our arrangements, we may share your Personal Information with applicable third parties to facilitate parking or support services related to your transaction.. Any of these third parties are authorized to use your Personal Information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control. When we provide Personal Information pertaining to a transaction, we may also provide payment information pertaining to that transaction, such as amount of money paid or types of payment methods used.</p><p>If you participate in a contest, promotion, or survey offered by us (whether online, over the phone, or by mail), we may use your Personal Information to manage your entry in such promotion, to notify you if you are a winner, or to fulfill promotional obligations. </p><p>Note that by purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services, electing to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to participate in, or register for, contests, promotions, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), from third parties on the Sites, those third parties may use your Personal Information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p><h3>E-mails</h3><p>We may use your e-mail address to notify you about the status of your order (if you have placed one), provide customer service information, or answer your questions and requests. We may also occasionally send you e-mail updates, notifications, or other promotional information about our products and services or about the products and services of our affiliated companies or trusted third party partners. We may share your e-mail address with our affiliated companies to enable them to send you emails directly regarding their products and services, sales and other promotions.
