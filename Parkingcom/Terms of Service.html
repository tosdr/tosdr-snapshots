<h1 class="entry-title">SP Plus Corporation Terms of Use</h1>
<div class="entry-content">
<h2>Last revised as of March, 2023</h2>
<p>Welcome. These Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") apply to the use of all websites and mobile apps (each a "<strong>Site</strong>" and collectively, the "<strong>Sites</strong>") that are owned and/or operated by SP Plus Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("<strong>SP+</strong>"), or by third parties authorized to act on behalf of SP+. SP+ values your interest in its services and appreciates your visit to its Sites.</p>

<p>When we refer to "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>," we mean SP+ or the specific division, subsidiary, or affiliate that operates the Site, provides its content, or processes information received through it, each as appropriate and applicable.</p>
<p>When we refer to "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>," we mean the person accessing the Site. If the person accessing the Site acts on behalf of, or for the purposes of, another person, including a business or other organization, "you" or "your" also means that other person, including a business organization.</p>

<h3>User Access</h3>

By accessing, browsing or otherwise using this Site, you acknowledge that you, the individual user of this Site, have read, understood and agree to be legally bound by these Terms, and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, without limitation or qualification, and further acknowledge that you have the authority and do hereby legally bind the other person or business entity, if any, to which you serve as an agent, independent contractor or employee thereof to the same Terms, without limitation or qualification. These Terms shall take effect immediately on your first use of the Site. If you do not agree to the Terms, you are not authorized to access, browse or otherwise use the Sites.</p>
<p>SP+, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to alter or change these Terms at any time. Any modifications will become effective when posted on this Site. By using the Sites after any changes in these Terms, you agree to be legally bound by the Terms as amended. Therefore, you should frequently revisit this page to determine the present terms and conditions to which you are legally bound.</p>
<p>SP+ may terminate your right to use this Site or the Sites with or without cause, at any time, effective immediately. In the event of any such termination, the restrictions on your use of the material on this Site shall survive such termination, and you agree to be bound by those terms.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property and Restrictions On Use Of Information and Content</h3>
<p>All information and content provided on the Sites (collectively, "Content"), whether explicitly marked or not, are the property of SP+, its subsidiaries, affiliated companies or joint venture partners, or others, and are subject to U.S. and international copyright laws. The Content includes, but is not limited to, the text, graphics, image, video, audio, animation, software, their related files and their arrangement on the Sites.</p>
<p>All trademarks, servicemarks, logos, model and brand names, emblems and protectable trade dress elements (collectively, "Marks"), whether explicitly marked or not, used on the Sites are owned by SP+, its subsidiaries, affiliated companies or joint venture partners, or others. Marks, are subject to U.S. (federal and state) and international trademark laws.</p>
<p>You may not copy, reproduce, download, upload, post, broadcast, transmit, distribute, publish, republish, or otherwise use any Content or Marks provided on the Sites in any form or by any means, or by any information storage or retrieval system for any commercial use without the express written permission of SP+. You may, however, copy, print or otherwise use the Content or Marks provided on the Sites provided that the use is for your personal or internal business use only and further provided that you: (1) maintain all copyright and other intellectual property notices together and intact with any Content or Marks; (2) do not modify or otherwise alter any Content or Marks; and (3) do not expressly or implicitly suggest an association with any services, product, brands or affiliates through the use of any Content or Marks. Other use of any Content or Marks, except as specifically permitted in these Terms or in a written instrument signed by SP+ is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Nothing contained in this Site shall be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary interest of SP+ or any third party.</p>
<p>Any use of the Content or Marks provided on the Sites that does not comport with the above Terms shall be an unauthorized use and may subject you to civil and criminal penalties as provided by applicable U.S. and international intellectual property laws.</p>

<h3>Online Parking Payment Service</h3>
<p>Certain Sites contain features (the "Online Payment Service") that permit you to pay for your parking privileges at certain parking facilities operated by SP+ as required under any applicable parking contract between you and SP+, including these Terms (your "Parking Contract"). By registering a user name, a password and an account, or by using the Online Payment Service(collectively a “Registration”) , you represent that you are the SP+ customer of record, or have legal authority to act on that person’s or business' behalf, for the account you enrolled on the Site.</p>
<p>With the authorization you provide through the Site or through the Online Payment Service ("Authorization"), your credit card will be charged or the bank account you have designated will be debited (either via one of the debit card networks by using your debit card or via the Automated Clearing House electronic payment system). You may schedule either one-time or recurring monthly payments for monthly parking plans, in addition to one-time payments for on-demand parking services. Pursuant to the Authorization, your credit card will be charged or your bank account will be debited to make payment to SP+. Each time you use the Online Payment Service you agree that SP+ is authorized to process your payment and facilitate the charging of your credit card or debiting your bank account for the amount of your parking fee and any other applicable fees that you have agreed to pay. You agree not to make a payment that exceeds your limits on your payment card account, transfer limits, or the balance of your bank account. Your agreement with your payment card issuer or financial institution where you have your bank account governs the use of your payment card or bank account, as applicable, and you must refer to that agreement to ascertain your rights and liabilities as a cardholder or account holder.</p>
<p>If SP+ is unable to debit or charge the specified bank account or credit card for any reason, you shall immediately pay your parking bill using another payment method. If any debit or charge is returned unpaid by your financial institution or payment card issuer, SP+ may charge, and you agree to pay, a returned payment fee permitted under applicable law. Notwithstanding that you have subscribed to use the Online Payment Service, you continue to be responsible under your Parking Contract to pay all amounts due on or before the date they are due, and SP+ may terminate your account and/or seek all remedies available to it under the Parking Contract or applicable law if you fail to pay such amounts when due for any reason. It is your sole responsibility to pay your account on time to avoid late fees, collection activities, or suspension of parking privileges. If, in good faith, you dispute any fees, collection activities or suspension of parking privileges, you must provide us written notice of the dispute within thirty (30) days of such action. SP+ is not liable for your failure to pay your account on time for any reason including, without limitation, due to interruption or unavailability of the Sites or the Online Payment Service. </p>
<p>You represent and warrant to SP+ that you are the owner or the authorized agent for the owner of the bank account or credit/debit card used in each Authorization and that debits and charges made in accordance with these Terms will not be disputed. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entering valid bank account or credit/debit card information as your payment source. If you have scheduled recurring payments for a monthly parking plan and (i) your payment source changes for any reason or (ii) you desire to change or delete the bank account or credit/debit card information used as your payment source or (iii) you desire to stop recurring payments, you must promptly notify SP+ of those changes by either using the applicable edit functions available in the Online Payment Service or contacting SP+ at <a href="mailto:customercare@spplus.com">customercare@spplus.com</a>. Payments initiated under the Online Payment Service will continue to be processed against your payment source until that information is changed as provided herein.</p>

<h3>SMS/MMS Mobile Message Program Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Upon Registration with any Site, or using our text or mobile message service (“SMS Services”) you consent to receive communications from us, which may include calls and text messages to the cellular telephone number you provide to us. Depending on your relationship with us and consents received, we or our service providers send text messages to: (1) provide you with information you requested from us; (2) update you regarding your orders and other transactions with us; and/or (3) respond to your customer service requests and other inquiries regarding your use of our services</p>
<p>Any text messages we send to you are subject to the SMS Terms set forth in this section.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these SMS Terms, you also consent to the use of an electronic record to document your agreement. You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by emailing SP+ at <a href="mailto:customercare@spplus.com">customercare@spplus.com</a>.</p>
<p>You may provide us with consent to send you text messages through our website or mobile application (e.g. by providing us with your phone number and signing up for text messages) or through communications or transactions with us (e.g. by initiating or agreeing to receive text message communications with customer service). By providing your consent, you agree to these SMS Terms, our Terms, and the <a href="http://www.spplus.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">SP+'s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Data obtained from you in connection with this text messaging service may include your mobile phone number, your wireless provider’s name, the date, time, and content of your messages and other information you provide to SP+ as part of this service. SP+ may use this information to contact you for the purposes of providing services you request from SP+. If you have questions regarding our privacy practices, please read the <a href="http://www.spplus.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">SP+'s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>By consenting to receive SP+ text messages, you agree that SP+ or its service providers may use any automated or non-automated technology to send you transactional and/or marketing text messages.</p>
<p>SP+ may terminate any text messaging services or your participation in our text message program at any time with or without notice, including, for example, before you have received any or all messages that you otherwise would have received, but these SMS Terms will still apply.</p>
<p>SP+ does not charge you for our text message program. But message and data rates may apply, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider.</p>
<p>We may send you one or more welcome messages or administrative messages, such as (in some cases), a request to confirm your opt-in. After that, you will receive recurring text messages, and the specific amount may vary depending on how you use our services (e.g. if you communicate with us through SMS, or if you send a HELP request).</p>
<p>SP+ text messages are supported on all U.S. and Canadian carriers. Please note, however, that the supporting mobile carriers may change without notice, and the particular text message program you join may be limited to specific carriers. Delivery of information and content to a mobile device may fail due to a variety of circumstances or conditions. You understand and acknowledge that network services, including but not limited to mobile network services, are outside of SP+’s control, and SP+ is not responsible or liable for issues arising from them. SP+ and the mobile carriers (for example, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile) are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
<p>By consenting to receive SP+ text messages, you represent that you are 16 years of age or older and understand the obligations  and agree to the terms set forth in these SMS Terms. You further represent that you are the subscriber of the cellular service at the mobile number provided or that you are authorized by the subscriber to sign-up for texts.  You are responsible for notifying SP+ immediately if you change your mobile telephone number. You may notify SP+ of a number change by contacting Customer Care at [phone number] or by emailing SP+ at customercare@spplus.com or via the support request site at https://parking.com/support</p>
<p>You agree to indemnify SP+ in full for all claims, expenses, and damages related to or caused in whole or in part by your failure to notify SP+ if you change your telephone number including, but not limited to, all claims, expenses, and damages related to or arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.SP+ may suspend or terminate your receipt of SP+ text messages if SP+ believes you are in breach of these SMS Terms. Your receipt of SP+ text messages is also subject to termination in the event that your mobile telephone service terminates or lapses. SP+ reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of SP+ text messages, with or without notice.  </p>
<p>You can cancel the SMS service at any time. To opt out of text messages, you must text STOP to that number.  After doing so, we may send you confirmation of your opt-out via text message. You further agree that texting STOP in response to our text message is the only reasonable method of opting out of our text messages. You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words other than "STOP" or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out.  </p>
<p>If you want to join again, just sign up as you did the first time and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.</p>
<p>For help visit <a href="https://parking.com/support" target="_blank">https://parking.com/support</a> or text "HELP" to 201-379-2616.  After you send the SMS message "HELP" to us, we will respond with a link to a self-service support page and the ability to submit a help request through Customer Care.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify these SMS Terms, or any part thereof, or add or remove terms at any time, and such modifications, additions or deletions will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued enrollment in SP+'s text messaging program shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such modifications, additions, or deletions. </p>
