    <h2>
      3. USER CONTENT
    </h2>
    <h4>
      What’s Permitted?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Services allow you and other users to create, post, send and store
      content or submissions, including messages, text, photos, videos, and other
      materials (we call these "User Content"). You are permitted to post User
      Content that: (a) is non-confidential; (b) you own or have all necessary
      legal rights to post to the Services; (c) you have the written consent,
      release, and/or permission from each identifiable person to use their name
      or likeness; (d) is accurate and not misleading or harmful in any manner;
      and (e) complies with these Terms, the Community &amp; Content Policy, and
      any applicable laws, rules or regulations. You understand that User Content
      may be displayed publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some of our Services, we may enable linking or sharing to certain
      available content. When such linking or sharing is permitted, you may only
      do so for personal, non-commercial purposes, and this permission is
      non-transferable and may be revoked at any time. Any such links shall: (i)
      contain only text, and not any MediaLab or Services trademarks, (ii) not
      suggest affiliation with MediaLab or cause confusion; and (iii) not portray
      MediaLab or the Services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise
      offensive manner, and not contain content that violates these Terms or the
      rights of any third party.
    </p>
    <p>
      You affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the
      necessary legal licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use, post,
      publish the User Content and to enable inclusion and use of the User
      Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms; and
      (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and
      every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use their
      respective name or likeness to enable inclusion and use of the User Content
      in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      MediaLab does not control, take responsibility for or assume liability for
      any User Content or any loss or damage related to User Content.
      Specifically for the Service “Manga,” MediaLab reserves the right to change
      the source of manga without prior notice. MediaLab does not claim to own or
      create any of the manga, or their underlying content, and MediaLab’s
      re-designation of the source of manga does not create any right of
      ownership to, or any liability for, the manga.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What’s Not Permitted?
    </h4>
    <p>
      User Content shall not violate these Terms or the
      <a href="https://www.medialab.la/terms-of-service">
        Community &amp; Content Policy
      </a>
      for any Service, which we may update from time to time. You agree not to
      post, store, create or otherwise publish or send through the Services any
      User Content that violates these Terms and/or the Community &amp; Content
      Policy. Among other things, MediaLab forbids User Content that infringes
      other’s intellectual property rights, including without limitation,
      copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights.
      Some other examples of User Content that is not permitted include, without
      limitation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Material that you do not own or have the legal rights to post in
        accordance with these Terms. For example, material that is the
        copyright, trademark, patent, or trade secret of another, or is
        otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy
        and publicity rights;
      </li>
      <li>
        Falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage any third party or
        MediaLab;
      </li>
      <li>
        Material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening,
        pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or
        encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give
        rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate
        as determined in our sole discretion;
      </li>
      <li>
        Advertisements or solicitations of business; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Fraudulent content or impersonating another person.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      5. HOW WE RESPOND TO VIOLATIONS
    </h2>
    <h4>
      Removal of User Content; Suspending or Terminating Account
    </h4>
    <p>
      To prevent abuses or violations of the Services or these Terms, MediaLab
      has the right to monitor your use of the Services. We will investigate
      activity related to your use of the Services using any means legally
      available and, where appropriate, may provide information about your use of
      the Services to law enforcement authorities and other third parties. As
      permitted and explained in our Privacy Policy, we may use and disclose data
      derived from your use of the Services to provide or improve the Services as
      well as to enforce these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As explained in the Section called “Termination,” MediaLab has the absolute
      right to stop providing part or all of the Services, or to suspend or
      terminate a User’s account at any time. MediaLab also has the right to
      delete or remove any User Content that we, in our sole discretion, view as
      violating these Terms, our Community &amp; Content Policy, or for any other
      reason. Removal of User Content and/or terminating access to Services can
      be done without prior notice to the User.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without limiting MediaLab’s absolute rights of termination or removal (see
      Section 17 below), there are certain actions that will result in immediate
      removal of User Content and/or account termination. User Content that poses
      a legal risk, is a threat to community members, or violates these Terms
      will be immediately removed. In addition, if we receive notice that User
      Content is alleged to infringe a third party’s intellectual property or
      proprietary rights, it will be immediately removed and you will be
      notified.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are determined to be a repeat offender, MediaLab will terminate your
      access to the Services. A repeat offender is a User who has been notified
      at least twice that they engaged in prohibited activity and/or has had User
      Content removed from any of the Services at least twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your account has been suspended or terminated, and you wish to dispute
      it, please contact us using our <a href="https://contact.worldstar.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact form</a>.

      include links and other content owned or operated by third parties,
      including advertisements and social "widgets." We may also allow access to
      third-party merchant sites from which you may purchase goods or services.
      We call all of these third-party services, merchants, and content
      "Third-Party Applications and Content."

    <p>
      Third Party Applications and Content have their own terms and privacy
      policies that govern your usage or interactions with them and their

      between you and any Third Party Applications and Content providers.
      MediaLab does not warrant that any Third Party Applications and Content are
      compatible with the Services and expressly disclaims any liability for any
      damages arising from your interaction with Third Party Applications and
      Content.

      15. DISPUTES—ARBITRATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES
      AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MEDIALAB.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Any dispute, claim, or cause of action arising out of or relating in any
        way to these Terms, the Services, or Service Materials (we call these
        “Disputes”), shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration on an
        individual basis, rather than in court, except as otherwise stated herein.
        You and MediaLab each waive your respective rights to a jury trial for
        Disputes.</b> This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration
      Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an exception to the arbitration requirement, the following disputes may
      be brought in court: (i) any dispute that seeks injunctive or other
      equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property
      (such as copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or
      patents) may be brought in court; (ii) any claim of interference or
      attempted interference with our Services; and (iii) disputes regarding the
      scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. In addition, either
      party may assert the Dispute in small claims court if the Dispute
      qualifies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>You and MediaLab agree that Disputes are personal and therefore, class
        actions and class arbitrations are not permitted.</b> Neither you nor MediaLab
      will commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other
      representative action or proceeding that would affect other users of the
      Services. The arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class
      arbitration or a representative action, and may not consolidate more than
      one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative
      proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Los Angeles,
      California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before
      and in accordance with the applicable rules of JAMS, which are available on
      the<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/"> JAMS website</a>. You either
      acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS
      or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the
      rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason. Arbitrations
      shall be conducted in English. All documents and information disclosed in
      the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the
      recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than
      for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and
      award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a
      need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
      As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms, and the applicable
      JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all
      procedural and substantive decisions regarding any individual Dispute and
      to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court (excluding
      class arbitrations or representative actions as noted above). Judgment on
      the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
      jurisdiction thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and MediaLab agree that you will notify each other in writing of any
      dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises before filing for
      arbitration. Notice to MediaLab must be sent via our <a href="https://contact.worldstar.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact form</a>. If the
      Dispute is not resolved informally between the parties within thirty (30)
      days of the date of notice, then either party may initiate arbitration in
      accordance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any Dispute must be filed within eighteen months after it arose; otherwise,
      your claim is permanently barred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Opt-Out of Arbitration:</i></b> You have the right within thirty (30) days of first
      accepting these Terms to decline this agreement to arbitrate. To do so, you
      must send written notice with your name, address, username, email address
      or phone number that you use for your Service account, identify the
      Service(s) you use, and clearly state that you want to opt out of the Terms
      of Service arbitration agreement. Send this notice to: 1222 6th St., Santa
      Monica, CA 90401.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding after providing MediaLab
      the required notice, MediaLab will pay the filing fees, administration and
      hearing costs, and arbitrator fees if the arbitration seeks less than US
      $10,000 and the Dispute is not determined to be frivolous or improper by
      the arbitrator. We will also pay the fees and costs for any arbitration
      that we initiate. For all other Disputes, the fees and costs shall be paid
      according to the JAMS rules, including rules regarding frivolous or
      improper claims. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to
      the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
      proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
      arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
    </p>

      (if ever), you agree that any action at law or in equity for any Dispute
      shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles
      County, California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent
      and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit,

    </h2>
    <p>
      If any provision, or part thereof, in these Terms shall be deemed unlawful,
      void or for any reason unenforceable, then the unenforceable provision or
      part thereof, shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not
      affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the provision and any
      remaining provisions in these Terms.
