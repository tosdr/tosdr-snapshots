						<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
						<p>
							To provide you the Services, we collect the categories of information described below.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Information you provide us when using our Services;</li>
							<li>Information we collect automatically;</li>
							<li>Information we get from advertisers, third parties, and offline sources;</li>
							<li>Any other information you choose to provide to us.</li>

						<p>
							Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to provide you usage of the Services.  Some of the data collection and uses are not strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related, and our basis for such collection and processing is for legitimate interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve the Services as explained in more detail below.  If you want to know how to exercise your rights to manage or delete the personal information we may have about you, please review “YOUR CHOICES” below.
						</p>
						<h3>Information You Provide Us When Using Our Services.</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Account Information.</b>  When you sign up to become a user of our Services, we collect personal information you choose to provide us, which may include your name, address, email, and phone number.  We may also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age or gender that will be associated with your Services account. All of this information that may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device is called “Personal Information”.  Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) De-identified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act, such as: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>User Content.</b>  We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others (collectively, “User Content”).  For example, we review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with.  All posts of contents and replies are public and are publicly displayed (for information deleting content, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below). User Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users, us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the rights and licenses in our Terms of Service).  We collect information you choose to upload, sync or import from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know.  Please keep in mind that if you include information that could identify you in any content you share or post, people who see it may determine your identity. MediaLab does not post chat messages publicly but, as with any message that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Your Purchase Transactions.</b>  If you make any purchases or engage in any other financial transactions through our Services, we collect information necessary to process the transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit card or payment account information; authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.
						</p>
						<h3>Information We Collect Automatically When Using Our Services.</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Location Information.</b>  Many features of the Services will not work unless you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect and use this information both while you are directly using the Services and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising partners may show you content or posts from people around you or places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location information is not available from your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more details about how you may control the collection of location information, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Usage Information.</b>  We collect information about your use of the Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content interactions and other information about your interactions with our Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Device Information.</b>  We collect information from and about the devices and browsers you use that integrate with our Services.  For example, we collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins, app and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available storage space, unique device identifiers and mobile network information (which is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area and to comply with applicable laws), information you give us access to through device settings such as photos, camera, or GPS location, identifiers associate with cookies, web beacons or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.  We may combine this information across different devices you use.  For example, we use information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</b>  Like most websites and applications, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us and our service providers to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience by seeing which areas and features of our Services are popular. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.  Keep in mind that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of some Services.
						</p>
						<h3>Information We Get From Advertisers, Third Parties, and Offline Sources.</h3>
						<p>
							We may receive information about you from advertisers, app developers, and publishers, or other online or offline sources with whom you interact and who have the rights to provide us with your information.  For example, advertisers, publishers, and other third parties may share how you interact with their ads, websites, or apps, how you use their services, or what purchases you make. This information may be provided whether or not you are logged in to a MediaLab Product at the time. We may combine such information with the information you have provided to us in order to provide and improve our Services. We require each of these advertisers, publishers, or other third parties to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.
						</p>
						<h3>Any Other Information You Choose To Provide To Us.</h3>
						<p>You may provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, update your account, interact with the Services, apply for a job at our company, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
						<h3>Collection and Use of Special Categories of Personal Data.</h3>
						<p>
							The following special categories of personal data may be considered sensitive under the laws of your jurisdiction and may receive special protection:
						</p>

						    your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more). Keep in mind, while

						    promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.
						    Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your
						    information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may
						    suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid
						    legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports

						    HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE
						</h2>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a
						    number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical
						    and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your
						    information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We
						    also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply
						    with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we
						    anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide
						    Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From
						    time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new
						    technologies and methods.
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect,
						    impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or
						    guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor
						    do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed,
						    altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks
						    of being online and conducting business online.
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you
						    electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may
						    also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs. Depending
						    on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a
						    security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of
						    your information, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@medialab.la">privacy@medialab.la</a>.

						    ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information
						    before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about
						    you. We may also reject your request for several reasons, including, by way
						    of example only, if the request risks the privacy of other persons or is

						    Deleting Account Information.
						</h3>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly, so
						    long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may choose to
						    delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we will then
						    remove them from the Services. However, it is important to note that your
						    deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for a
						    limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup
						    reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of the
						    Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them. Search
						    engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our Services.
						    You may have to contact these third-party sites or search engines directly
						    to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and
						    procedures.
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the “Email
						    Support” link in settings from inside the applicable Product, or by
						emailing us at:    <a href="mailto:support@medialab.la">support@medialab.la</a>. Remember that
						    information that others have shared about you is not part of your account
						    and will not be deleted.
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain
						    information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for
						    the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and others. We may also retain
						    cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain limited
						    period of time.

						    Deleting Location Information.
						</h3>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services or
						    access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to consent to
						    the collection of location information from your mobile device or platform.
						    If you consent to the collection of this information but later wish to
						    withdraw your consent, you may do so at any time by either changing the
						    settings on your mobile device or deleting our mobile application Services
						    from your device.

						<h3 dir="ltr">
						    Opting Out Of Cookies And Other Technologies.
						</h3>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you
						    the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking
						    technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually
						    change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
						    before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers
						    are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be
						    the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time.
						    Opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude
						    advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying
						    customized advertising. In addition, opting out will not prevent any
						    advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to
						    you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. You
						    will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to
						    visit our Services.
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">
						    When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out
						    cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same Service, the
						    opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This means that if you
						    choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and
						    functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices
						    from being stored. As a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor,
						    your election to opt-out. We encourage you to refer to the relevant
						    instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage
						    cookies and other tracking technologies. For more information on how to
						    disable cookies on the most common browsers, we’ve assembled the following
