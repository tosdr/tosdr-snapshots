  <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is SpaceHey&#39;s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, <a href="https://spacehey.com">https://spacehey.com</a>, including all subdomains and other sites we own and operate. </p>
  <p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online service. </p>

  <p>Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is. </p>
  <p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons. </p>
  <h4>Personal Information</h4>

All user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials. </p>
  <p>Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of publication will be public after posting (and subsequent review or vetting process). Once published, it may be accessible to third parties not covered under this privacy policy. </p>
