You can view our full explanation of how we handle your privacy on our dedicated <a href="https://www.olark.com/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> page (the “Privacy Policy”).</p><p>To the extent Olark processes personal data in connection with its provision of the Services, the terms of Olark’s <a href="https://olark.com/downloads/Olark-Data-Processing-Agreement.pdf">Data Processing Agreement</a> shall apply and are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><h2><strong>100% Service Guarantee</strong></h2><p>We will respond to your support inquiries within one business day and we will ensure the Services have no unexpected downtime.

Your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again. In the event of any termination, Olark will not refund any of the prepaid Fees.  Such termination of the Services will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. Olark reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p><h2>‍<strong>Refunds</strong></h2><p>Olark is not obligated to provide refunds or credits for partial months or years of the Services, upgrades or downgrades, or unused time during your subscription.

If you terminate your account in the event of a suspension for more than 5 business days or discontinuance of the Services, you will be entitled to a refund of the proportion of pre-paid fees attributable to the period after termination.</p><h2>‍<strong>Warranty Disclaimers</strong></h2><p>You expressly understand and agree that:</p><p>Olark warrants that your data will be treated in accordance with its Privacy Policy, as described in the Privacy Policy.
