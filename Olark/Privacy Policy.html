<h2 id="11-cookies">11. Cookies</h2>
<p>When you visit websites on the Internet, your browser may automatically transmit information to the websites you visit throughout every visit. Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party tools in the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or use on the Services to personalize your visit. We do not control how third-party cookies are used. You should check the relevant third-party’s website for more information about how they use cookies. Both first party and third-party cookies can serve a number of different functions, such as analytics, marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>With your consent, we or our service providers may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means in connection with the Services and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Services usage and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. Our service providers may use a “pixel tag” to collect information about your visits to the Services and to other websites, and they may use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. We will not share this information with third parties in a manner that personally identifies you.</p>
<p>Olark&rsquo;s embedded chat (and specifically the domains olark.com, api.olark.com, assets.olark.com, nrpc.olark.com, and static.olark.com) does not collect, retain, or share data regarding a particular Customer End User&rsquo;s activity across multiple websites or applications that are not owned by Olark. Olark does assign each user a unique user ID within the scope of an individual website, but does not collect or retain IP or any information except information users volunteer (for example, an email or credit card number) which would allow Olark to identify the same particular user on more than one website. For the purposes of abuse and fraud prevention, Olark may use Customer End User IP during a chat session to block fraudulent IPs, trolls, and prevent other abuse; this IP information will be destroyed after the session, including logs destroyed after 7 days.</p>
<p>We may use the following types of cookies and tracking technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>. These cookies are essential because they enable you to move around our Services and use certain features on our Services. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas. Without these cookies, some Services cannot be provided.</li>
<li><strong>Performance/Analytics Cookies</strong>. These cookies collect information about your use and interaction with our Services. The types of information collected by such cookies include which pages you go to most often, how much time you spend on that page, or if you get error messages from certain pages.</li>
<li><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>. These cookies allow us to remember your preferences and choices so that we can tailor our Services to you and your interests. For example, these cookies will remember which country or language you selected, or will use your display name on parts of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are logged in to your account, we may associate the cookie information with the Personal Information tied to your account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising/Marketing Cookies</strong>. These cookies allow us to deliver relevant marketing and advertisements to you. They collect information about your interactions with our marketing activities (e.g., on the website or via emails) to determine what your interests and preferences are, and how effective such advertising or marketing campaigns are.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can instruct your browser, by changing its options under Settings or Preferences, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use some or all portions or functionalities of the Services.</p>
<p>We do not control interest-based advertising cookies on our Services. If you would like more information about such cookies or to opt out of having your cookie information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="14-security">14. Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain, and require our service providers to maintain, appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the Personal Information you provide to us.</p>
<p>However, even the best security measures are not foolproof and we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. We cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of the Personal Information you transmit to or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS because we have no way of protecting Personal Information  that is out of our control.</p>
