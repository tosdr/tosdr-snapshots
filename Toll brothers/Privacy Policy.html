Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on your internet provider. Either way, we cannot identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you reached our website by clicking on a link or advertisement on another website, then we also track that information. This helps us maximize our internet exposure and understand our users&#x27; interests. All this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not individual reports that identify you personally. We also may retain copies of your written communications with Toll Brothers, which may contain personal information, regardless of the medium through which you correspond with Toll Brothers, including, but not limited to communications the Company receives from you through the website, internet or other electronic or paper means.</p><p>We also use &quot;cookies,&quot; which are small pieces of data (text files) that a website — when visited by a user — asks the user&#x27;s browser to store on your computer, mobile device, or any other device through which you access a website.

A web beacon is a small, graphic image on a webpage, web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the webpage, document, or e-mail message.
