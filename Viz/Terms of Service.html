All digital product purchases are final and no refunds will be given. If you reside in a country where applicable law provides for a period of cancellation if you change your mind after purchasing a paid subscription, Viz Media will issue a full refund if requested within the statutory period, but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume the subscription. Digital content is only available for purchase by users with a credit card that has a billing address located in one of the following countries: United, States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Philippines, Singapore, and India.
