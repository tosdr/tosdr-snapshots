					<div id="priv-security">
						<h4 class="font-xl">8. Data security</h4>
						<p>We have implemented strong security controls to safeguard User’s personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration.</p>
						<p>For example, to protect your personal data, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is used during the transmission of data. This means that an approved encryption procedure is used for communication between your computer or device and Freepik's servers, as long as your browser supports SSL.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="priv-transfer">
						<h4 class="font-xl">9. International data transfers</h4>
						<p>We carry out international data transfers in relationship with some of the processing described in the previous clause with certain data processors: subcontractors and content delivery networks to help us to deliver our Services.</p>
						<p>A data processor, as already said, is an external subcontractor that we hire, and that may have access to personal data about users or collaborators, or that stores them in the context of the service provided to us.</p>
						<p>Some of these external service providers are located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), so the processing of your personal data involves an international data transfer.</p>
						<p>Our international data transfers can occur to countries with a level of protection of personal data potentially lower than that imposed by the RGPD. Said international data transfers are covered by standard contractual clauses (art 46.2.c) GDPR).</p>
					</div>

					<div id="priv-complain">
						<h4 class="font-xl">10. Complaint submission</h4>
						<p>If you, the User, do not agree with the way Freepik Company processes your personal data, you can contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:rpd@freepik.com">rpd@freepik.com</a> or by contacting directly to the <b>Spanish Data Protection Agency</b> (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, AEPD, in Spanish) here <a href="http://www.aepd.es" target="_blank">www.aepd.es</a>.</p>
