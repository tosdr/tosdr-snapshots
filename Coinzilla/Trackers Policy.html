<strong>1. Cookies and Other Automated Means of Data Collection</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
This section will help you learn more about cookies, other automated means of data collection, and how they
all work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1 Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file, usually composed of letters and numbers, which is stored on your computer,
tablet, mobile phone, or any other device that you might use when entering a certain site. It's mostly used
by the owners of different sites in order to make them function, improve their performance, or collect
analytical information.</p>
<p>The cookie is installed upon request by a web server to a browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and is
completely “passive” (it does not contain software, viruses, or spyware and cannot access the information on
the user’s hard drive). The cookie stores certain information (for example, your preferred language or
settings of the web page), which your browser can retransfer to us when you access the web page again
(depending on the lifetime of the Cookie).</p>
<p>Cookies themselves do not require personal information to be used and, in most cases, do not personally
identify Internet users.</p>
<p>With the help of cookies, your use of our Sites and Services will be more efficient and also more
enjoyable. We may also use cookies to personalize your experience, improve customer support, and provide you
with customized content and relevant information whenever you’re interacting with our Services. For further
details regarding the delivery of targeted advertisements by our Services, please check the <strong>Interest-Based
Advertisements</strong> section in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2 Types of Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>
What types of cookies are there?
</p>
<p>
There are several types of cookies. Their classification is made according to their lifespan, role, and
source, as follows:
</p>
<p>
a. Types of cookies depending on the lifespan
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li><strong>Session cookies</strong>: they are temporarily stored in the cookie folder of the web browser
until the user exits that site or closes the browser window (e.g., when logging in / logging out on a
webmail account or on social networks).
</li>
<li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong>: they are stored on the hard drive of a computer or equipment
(depending on the default lifetime of the cookie). Persistent cookies also include those placed by a
website other than the one the user is currently visiting - known as 'third-party cookies' (cookies placed
by third parties) - which can be used anonymously to memorize the interests of a user so that advertising
is delivered as relevant as possible to users.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
b. Types of cookies depending on their role
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong>: these cookies are necessary for websites to function
properly. Strictly necessary cookies allow you to navigate through the site and benefit from its features.
Without these cookies, we will not be able to offer certain features, such as automatically redirecting to
the least busy server or retaining your list of preferences.M
</li>
<li><strong>Functional cookies</strong>: these cookies record information about the choices that users make
and also allow site operators to customize the site according to the user’s requirements. For example,
cookies can be used to save preferences related to a category/segment.M
</li>
<li><strong>Performance and analysis cookies</strong>: these types of cookies offer the possibility to the
operators of the internet sites to monitor the visits and traffic sources and the way in which the users
interact with the website or certain sections of the website. The information provided by the analysis
cookies helps operators understand how visitors use the sites and then use this information to improve the
way the content offered to users is presented.M
</li>
<li><strong>Targeting and advertising cookies</strong>: these cookies may provide the ability to monitor the
users' online activities and establish user profiles, which can then be used for marketing purposes. For
example, based on cookies, the products and services agreed upon by a user can be identified, this
information subsequently serving to send appropriate advertising messages to that user.M
</li>
</ul>
<p>
c. First-party cookies vs. third-party cookies
</p>
<p>
Each cookie has a "responsible" (i.e., website / Internet domain) that places that cookie.
</p>
<p>
First-party cookies are placed by the Internet domain/website accessed by the user (whose address appears in
the address bar of the browser). For example, if the user visits the <a href="https://www.coinzilla.com" target="_blank">www.coinzilla.com</a>
site and the domain of the cookie placed on his computer is <a href="https://www.coinzilla.com" target="_blank">www.coinzilla.com</a>,
then it is a first-party cookie.
</p>
<p>
A third-party cookie is placed by another Internet domain/website than the one accessed by the user; this
means that the website accessed also contains information from a third-party website - for example, an
advertising banner that appears on the accessed site. Thus, if the user visits the www.coinzilla.com site
but the cookie placed on his computer has as domain rubiconproject.com, then it is a third-party cookie.
</p>
<p>
d. Embedded content (buttons, applications, and social widgets)
</p>
<p>
Web pages allow the implementation of social buttons or widgets from a third-party, which allow users to
interact with the sites whose social buttons or widgets are implemented. The user's interaction with the
social buttons or widgets from a third-party allows the third-party to collect some information about that
user, including the IP address, information in the page header, and information about the browser.
</p>
<p>
e. How do targeting and advertising cookies work?
</p>
<p>In general, data about internet browsing activity is collected and analyzed anonymously. If a specific
interest emerges from this analysis, a cookie is placed on the user's computer, and this cookie determines
what advertisement the user will receive, which is called interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Interest-based advertising is a way of delivering advertisements on the websites you visit and making them
more relevant to your interests. The common interests are grouped according to the navigation activity
previously carried out, and the users are served only the advertising that suits their interests. In this
way, advertising is relevant and as useful as possible.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Other Automated Means of Data Collection</strong></p>
<p>Once we have their consent, we may place a pixel tag on our advertiser Customers' websites. Pixel tags are
transparent graphic images displayed on a site, also known as clear GIFs or web beacons. In association with
cookies, these pixels are used to analyze visitors' behavior on the site once they arrive via our Services.
For instance, we may place pixel tags to track conversions or to create a custom audience for our advertiser
Customers to target on our network (i.e., retargeting). For additional details regarding our abovementioned
operations, please access the <strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> section of our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The types of cookies that our service providers and we may use on the Sites and/or when delivering our
Services are listed in Section 3 below.</p>
<p id="information-we-collect">
<strong>2. Information We Collect</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p id="cookies-purpose">

<p>
The purposes of these cookies may consist of (i) conducting communications via an electronic communications
network or (ii) enabling information society service providers to offer such services in accordance with
your specific requirements.

<strong>
Functionality Cookies
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use these cookies so that we can save and keep track of your Information or choices you have made on our
Sites (e.g., your username, language, or region of residence) and to provide an overall enhanced, improved,
and tailored user experience and site functionality.</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
<strong>
Performance (Analytical) Cookies
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The deployment of these cookies may involve keeping track of visitors' activities on the Site, such as the
most visited pages and what webpages have displayed error messages upon accessing. No Information that can
lead to your identification is collected by these cookies, as all the data they may collect is aggregated,
making the User completely anonymous. The only purpose of these cookies is to enhance the Site's
functionality.
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">

<strong>
Advertising (Targeting) Cookies
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These cookies may be used by us in tailoring advertisements that are in accordance with your interests. Such
cookies may also be deployed to restrict how many times an advertisement is displayed in addition to serving
us in the evaluation of our advertising campaign and its effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
In order to differentiate a "first-party" cookie from a "third-party" cookie, you must consider the domain
that places the cookie.
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li><strong>First-party cookies</strong> are the cookies implemented by the same website you are visiting at
that moment (e.g., cookies set up by www.coinzilla.com).
</li>
<li><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are the cookies set up not by the website that is visited by the
User but by another domain. If a visitor enters a site that has a cookie configured on that site by
another entity, then it is a third-party cookie.
</li>
<li><strong>Session cookies</strong> are used by website operators during browser sessions to link your
online activities. A browser session is the sum of actions you perform from the moment you open your
Internet browser window to the moment you close it. Session cookies are generated on a temporary basis and
are all deleted once the browser is closed.
</li>
<li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> are cookies that remain for a certain (specified) period of time on
your device. Both session and persistent cookies may be used on our Sites or through our Services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.5 Other technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>On our Sites, we also use the ReCAPTCHA software, specifically Google ReCAPTCHA “I’m not a robot”.</p>
<p>With this version of ReCAPTCHA, Google pays attention to how the User's mouse moves on the webpage to
determine whether the User is a person or a robot. With each interaction on a Site that has the ReCAPTCHA
service implemented, the software will learn more about human behavior, analysis that leads to the most
accurate results. When you are reported as having a suspicious hit, you will be asked to "click" on certain
photos. This test gives the user only 55 seconds to resolve, which will result in the user (bot-type) being
unable to tick what is prompted in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The ReCAPTCHA processes the following personal data: the IP address of the device, the Site visited, the
date and duration of the visit, browser, operating system information, language settings, Java script
objects, the Google account if the user has such an account and is logged in at the same time as they visit
the website, mouse movement over the ReCAPTCHA field.</p>
<p>More details on how Google processes data in the context of ReCAPTCHA use are available in Google’s Privacy
Policy available
