</p>
<p>
Coinzilla's Users are provided with options that allow them to control how their Information is used by
certain Services. Customers are able to control the interest-based content and ads they receive through
several options:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>The display of interest-based ads from Coinzilla can be disabled by clicking on the opt-out button
below. It should be noted that you will still be able to see Coinzilla's content recommendations even if
the opt-out function is enabled. Opting out prevents Coinzilla from using your Information to generate
recommendations based on your particular interests. The recommendations you will receive from now on will
be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
</li>
</ul>
<p> You can opt out using our form at the Coinzilla opt-out page.</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>Not Opted-Out: You will receive personalized recommendations from Coinzilla based on your browsing
history.
</li>
<li>Opted-Out: Your activity will no longer be tracked by Coinzilla, and therefore, you will not be
receiving personalized content recommendations derived from your past online activities.
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>As we individually track device or browser operations, you will need to opt out on each device and
browser individually in order to opt out completely across multiple devices.
</li>
<li>Your opt-out may not come into effect if your browser is set to reject cookies, as we have already
recognized your opt-out configuration based on an opt-out cookie that we've sent to you. For the
opt-out to be effective in this scenario, you will be required to confirm that your browser has the
proper configuration. Users that have a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra first have to
change their Privacy and Security Settings in order to disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" and
"Block All Cookies" and then access, once again, this privacy policy or their opt-out platform of
choice to reset the opt-out settings.
</li>
<li>Technologies that do not use cookies may be used by Coinzilla in very few specific situations. These
technologies work in a similar manner to cookies, as they help us create tailored ad recommendations
based on your interests and verify if the opt-out function was enabled. Please keep in mind that you
may not be able to restrict the use of non-cookie technologies with certain web browsers, but you can
go to the "User Choices" section on this page and click on the Opt-Out feature to have this function
enabled.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Users can also disable getting targeted ads from Coinzilla and other advertising companies.
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>The NAI opt out tool stops Coinzilla and other NAI-approved member companies from sending you
targeted ads. The NAI offers a guideline on how to opt out from mobile devices that run on Android,
iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems.
</li>
<li>The Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites also feature more information regarding User
Choices and how to disable targeted advertising for each of the member companies.

</li>
<li>You will still be able to see the advertisements from the companies featured in the DAA, DAAC, or
EDAA consumer choice pages, even if you have activated the opt-out function. Opting out prevents these
companies from using your Information to create ad recommendations based on your particular interests.
The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are
visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
</li>
<li>Your opt-out may not be effective if your browser has been set to reject opt-out cookies when
visiting DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages (these cookies notice companies if your opt-out
preference is enabled).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2.7 How We Keep User information</strong>
</p>
<p>For ad-related purposes, User Information may be held for twelve (12) months since the User last interacted

aggregating the data.</p>
<p>The resulting de-identified or aggregated data may also be held by us to be used for reporting and analysis
during the entire period it is of commercial necessity. This type of data cannot be used for the
identification of an individual or device. Opt-out data may be retained for longer than twelve (12) months

As mentioned above, in order to provide our services, we may disclose your personal data to our contractors
(Coinzilla's Affiliates, parent companies, and/or subsidiaries), who may be located both in the EU and
outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Therefore, in order to prevent such discrepancies from
affecting your Personal Information, we seek to comply with the guarantees listed below:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>the country to which we transfer your personal data has been deemed to provide an adequate level of
protection for personal data by the European Commission;
</li>
<li>a specific contract approved by the European Commission which gives safeguards to the processing of
personal data, the so-called Standard Contractual Clauses.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer, User, and Visitor Information is currently stored in Coinzilla’s data centers located in the
United States, Germany, France, India, Singapore, and Japan.</p>
<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, all the member states of the European Union have uniform
protection of personal data and personal privacy. This also applies in the EEA countries. Personal data can
thus be transmitted freely within this area without any restrictions (e.g., Germany, France).</p>
<p>Your data is transferred to USA, India, and Singapore based on standard contractual clauses. Copies of the
implemented standard contractual clauses can be provided upon request.</p>
<p>Japan is recognized as providing an adequate level of protection.</p>
