</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the Coinzilla platform.</li>
<li>These Terms apply to any and all Services, information, texts, and other products, offered on the Website by the Company.</li>
<li>By accessing the Website, opening an Account on the Website, or ticking the "I agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy" checkbox, you agree to be bound by these Terms and confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted all the provisions of these Terms, as well as provisions of our Privacy Policy, and other legally binding document publicly available on the Website.</li>
<li>You cannot use the Website and create the Account if you have not read, understood, and accepted all the provisions of these Terms.</li>
<li>KYC (Know your customer - individual/business) is the process of identifying and verifying customers. Identification means gathering a customer's personal/business data; verification means checking that this data is accurate. For individuals, the KYC process will be done through the UAB partner "iDenfy", a company registered under the number 304617621, headquartered in Gričiupio g. 7-212, Kaunas, https://idenfy.com. Regarding legal entities, they will upload the incorporation documents of the company with which they registered as a user, and these will be verified by Coinzilla's KYC team.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Description of the Services and Data Reporting</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Coinzilla Platform is an advertising network focused on connecting Advertisers and Publishers through such service globally. The Services provided by the Company through the Website allow (i) Publishers to market advertising space on websites owned and/or managed by them, by selling such services to the Company, and (ii) Advertisers to promote their website, services and/or products or to have their press-releases published on Publishers' websites, by buying such services from the Company.</li>
<li>The Company offers Advertisers the opportunity to set up and configure their advertising campaign (e.g. Advertisers can choose the type of banner they want to use or the country targeted by the advertisement). "Campaign" means the order issued by an Advertiser via the Coinzilla Platform, defined by a number of settings which are necessary for the broadcasting of an advertisement or sponsored content (press releases and various articles) on the Publishers' websites, intended at promoting Advertisers' projects.</li>
<li>Advertisers and Publishers will have access to the Services only after the creation of a User account on the Website, subject to the conditions set out below.</li>
<li>At the Advertisers' request, our Company's team may create unique press releases according to Advertisers' specifications and deliver them to the Publishers.</li>
<li>For Marketplace, the prices for the Services provided by the Company will be set by the User with the Company's representatives and will be paid in advance by the Users (in which case the Users may request such Services only if there are amounts paid in advance and not used, on the date of request, from which the price of the requested Services may be deducted) or paid in other manner, expressly agreed by the parties. For Display Campaigns, Advertisers may also choose a price for 1,000 impressions. The Advertisers are free to choose the bid that they want to pay. If another User offers a bigger bid, the Advertisers offering a lower one will not receive the requested traffic.</li>
<li>Other services that may be subsequently implemented on the Website are subject to this set of Terms and Conditions, unless they have specific terms and conditions that will be formulated separately.</li>
<li>All advertising Campaigns on the Coinzilla Platform are served, tracked, and reported by the Company. The data generated by a Campaign will only be available for 1 (one) year. After the expiration of this period the data will be deleted.</li>
</ol>
<h2>User Account Registration</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>In order to have access to the Services, you have to create a User account on the Coinzilla Platform following the steps communicated by the Company.</li>
<li>Upon registration, the User has to provide all the requested information in the registration form available on the Website and to confirm the email address in order for the User account to be created.</li>
<li>The confirmation that the email address used to create the account belongs to you will be done by entering the 6-digit code received on the provided email address, in the respective field.</li>
<li><strong>THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CREATE THE USER ACCOUNT MUST BE REAL, COMPLETE AND CORRECT.</strong> If the information provided during the creation of the user account changes subsequently, the User is obliged to promptly update the respective information contained in the User's account.</li>
<li>For security reasons, any changes to the data regarding the User (Advertiser/Publisher) account, billing address, email address used to log in, etc., will be made through a request sent to our team from the email address used for the user's account, containing all the information to be modified. The email address to which the data change request will be sent is kyc@coinzilla.com.</li>
<li>The Company reserves the right to verify the information provided by the User upon registration and to also request supporting documents if any third parties (such as, without limitation, state authorities, banks, payment processors) so request for grounded reasons.</li>
<li>A User can create multiple user accounts for the Coinzilla Platform, respecting the KYC process for each account, according to point 3.5.</li>
<li>Through the User account created on the Coinzilla Platform, the User's access to the Services provided by the Company is ensured, with the account becoming functional after the User goes through the process of knowing the clientele, according to point 3.5. Moreover, the User account shall keep the record of all the amounts paid in advance by the Advertisers as per Clause 7 below, or, as the case may be, the record of all the amounts owed by the Company to the Publishers for the Services provided by them under Clause 8 below. For the avoidance of any doubt, the information on the value of such amounts is reflected in the User account for information purposes only, providing the User with the record of the amounts that can be further used for acquiring Services, or, for the Publisher, the record of the amounts owed by the Company at any given time. Depending on the operations made by the User, the information in the User account shall be appropriately updated. For the avoidance of any doubt, the User account does not store funds and does not allow the performance of any transfers or other operations in relation to them.</li>
<li>
By creating the account, the User expressly declares and warrants that:
<ol type="a">
<li>Uses the Website for the specific purposes of its commercial activity which it is authorized to carry out;</li>
<li>All information provided is complete, true, and accurate;</li>
<li>Understands and agrees that, in addition to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions, certain Services may be governed by specific rules. Any such rules will be published separately;</li>
<li>Understands that they are solely responsible for the security of the account and account password and will not allow other persons to access the account. Any breach or suspicion of breach of security of the User's account must be reported immediately to the Company. The Company will not be held liable for any damage caused as a result of the breach of account security due to the conduct of the User or any person accessing and/or using the User account, including but not limited to situations when: computer systems used are infected with viruses or other malware, or the device on which the User is logged in is accessed by anyone else, or the security of the email account associated with the User's account is in any way compromised.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Company reserves the right to delete user accounts that have been inactive for a period of one year, with the provisions of Clause 7.18 being applicable in the case of Advertisers. The Publishers' accounts will be deleted under the conditions provided by Clause 8.11.</li>
<li>Without a valid and confirmed email address, the User account cannot function optimally. Confirmation of the email address also prevents unauthorized persons from using the email address.</li>
<li>Users shall not use automated means, including scripts, robot, bot, spider, crawler and /or any computer applications/programs that may deceive or simulate certain activities or statuses on the Website, or, in any way, exploit certain functions or vulnerabilities of the Website in order to obtain advantages, for themselves or for other Users, regarding the use of the Services offered through the Website.</li>
<li>The Company reserves the right to restrict or exclude Users' access to the Website, as well as to delete or restrict the user account, within the limits of the law, if it considers that based on the User's conduct or activity, access and existence of the account may harm in any way the Company or other Users.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE!</strong> The Company shall not accept the registration as Users and shall not perform any activities whatsoever (shall not collect amounts from or make payments to) individuals or legal entities with their domicile/residence/office in one of the following States: <strong>Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea, Iraq, Iran, Liberia, Myanmar, Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Syria, Zimbabwe, North Korea, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine (only for Donetsk and Luhansk).</strong></li>

<li>Publishers are not allowed to use more than one banner size per page (e.g. the Publishers are not allowed to display two 300x250 banners on the same page, but they can display a 300x250 banner together with a 728x90 one);</li>
<li>Publishers are not allowed to display a banner on a different website than the one it was approved for (e.g. if a banner was approved for website1.com, you are only allowed to display it on website1.com);</li>
<li>Publishers are not allowed to purchase any type of traffic from other sources (advertising networks or other websites) to send it to our Advertisers' websites through their banners;</li>
<li>Publishers are not allowed to auto refresh their website to increase the impressions of the banners they display;</li>

<li>If the sponsored content was deleted by the Publisher without a valid reason, i.e. without complying with Clauses 7.1 and 8.2 of these Terms and Conditions, the Publisher must fully refund to the Company the amounts paid by the Advertiser for such article.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If your website is rejected, you can open a ticket and ask for a second review, but only after 1 (one) week has passed from the date of the denial. If you request to be rechecked faster than 1 (one) week, your request will be rejected.</li>
<li>If the Publisher's website changes its content so that it may violate the above provisions, the Publisher is obliged to immediately notify these changes to the Company via email or through our ticket system. If after the verifications the Company comes to the conclusion that the modifications violate the present Terms and Conditions, the Company has the right to suspend the advertising Campaign and/or block the Publisher account.</li>
<li>Websites that have been accepted by the Company have to respect the provisions of these Terms and Conditions for the entire period of validity of the Agreement. The Company reserves the right to amend or modify the Website acceptance policy (as stipulated in this Clause 6) based on its internal and international rules, subject to communicating such to the Users as per the present Terms and Conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Special clauses applicable to Advertisers</h2>
<ol start="7">
<h3>A) Advertising exposure</h3>
<li>The Company shall make its best efforts for the articles purchased through the Coinzilla Marketplace Platform to remain live on the Publisher's website(s) (as long as the Company has a contractual relationship with the Publisher and the Advertisers are paying the requested fees). However, the Publisher will be allowed to remove the article in the cases provided for in Clause 8.2 below.</li>
<li>If, under the conditions laid down in Clause 7.1 above, the Publisher deletes an article acquired via the Coinzilla Platform, the Advertiser will not be entitled to a refund of the amounts paid for the purchase of such article. The Company will not be responsible in any way for this action.</li>
<h3>B) Price of the Services</h3>
<li>The Company may offer Advertisers discounts, rebates, or other promotions in respect of the Services offered, in accordance with its commercial policy. Any such discounts or other types of promotions will be displayed on the Website.</li>
<li>In order to start using the Services, Advertisers have to pay to the Company, in advance, a minimum amount of EUR 100. The amounts paid may be spent on any campaign type offered by the Company. For the amounts paid in advance to the Company by the Advertiser (which represent the counter-value of the Services provided by the Company through the Platform), the Company will issue relevant invoices. Advertisers' active campaigns will receive traffic as long as the price for the supply of these Campaigns is paid in advance. For information purposes, the value of the amounts paid to the Company by the Advertiser is recorded in the User account of the Advertiser. The value standing to the balance of the User account shall be updated to the extent that the Company provides Services to the Advertiser, as per the latter's instructions. The balance of the User account shall indicate at any time the value of the amounts paid in advance by the Advertising Agent and in consideration for which no Services have been provided yet by the Company. If the Advertiser's User account balance becomes zero, i.e. there are no further amounts paid in advance by the Advertising Agent and not used, all Campaigns activated through its user account will be stopped immediately.</li>
<li>
The price for the Services provided by the Company is calculated based on the price model of the advertising Campaign type chosen by the Advertiser (i.e., CPM) and statistics gathered by the Company. For details, please refer to Insertion Order form that you can find on the Website.
<p>
CPM = Cost per thousand impressions.
</p>
</li>
<li>For Marketplace, the Company reserves the right to change at any time all advertising prices. We recommend to always check the price mentioned on the Website before placing an order. For Display Campaigns, when selecting the price, you will find information on the Coinzilla Platform on the highest price existing at that time (Bid/CPM). The amount of Campaigns spending will be deducted automatically from the amounts you paid in advance and recorded for informative purposes in the balance of the User account, in accordance with Clause 7.4 above.</li>
<h3>C) Deposits</h3>
<li>Advertisers can transfer funds to the Company for the payment in advance of the price of the Services via bank transfer or using cryptocurrency (BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, USDC, USDT, and others) which will be converted automatically into EUR via an authorized third-party payment processor, and will be collected by the Company in EUR. For fund transfers using other cryptocurrencies, please contact your account manager.</li>
<li>In order to be able to make a payment to the Company, your profile needs to be filled in with your real personal information (first and last name, email address, country of residence, and full address).
