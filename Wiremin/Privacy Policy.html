WireMin apps are designed as equal nodes in the network that communicate with other users on common protocols. It is not based on cloud service or central servers, so no single bit of user data will be transferred or stored in any computing facility controlled by us. WireMin messages and contents, as well as user identities and social relationships are stored and replicated among users' devices with end-to-end encryption, which only allows the users’ and the intended recipients’ access. Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are available below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></p><p class="p4">We don’t operate a service.

Your identity, messages, and social relationship data are always end-to-end encrypted so that they can never be shared or viewed by anyone except for you and the intended recipients.</p><p class="p14"><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p><p class="p11">No user information will be provided to us, not a single bit. There is information you provided that is stored in your own device and replicated on other users' devices, in a way that is anonymous and end-to-end encrypted without revealing the content and the identity of the owner.</p><p class="p8">Account Information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p11">A root secret is created when you create an account, which is only stored on your devices. It is the only information used to control an account fully. We support mnemonic backup in case of forgetting a passcode or losing the device. But it is on your own to keep it in a safe and secret place. You may optionally add other information to your accounts, such as a profile name and avatar. This information is end-to-end encrypted, shared with intended recipients, and may be replicated in other users' devices anonymously</p><p class="p8">Messages.</p><p class="p4">WireMin and unintended users cannot decrypt or otherwise access the content of your messages or profile data. Messages will be temporarily relayed and stored by others' devices for hours. While only your and intended recipients can decrypt messages. Message history is kept only on you and your recipients' devices.</p><p class="p5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p11">No user information is stored in any computing facility controlled by us or any server. WireMin apps can deliver messages without user identities and their social relationships.</p><p class="p8">Phone Contacts.</p><p class="p11">WireMin doesn't read phone contacts or your phone number for account registration or recommending connections/contacts to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p8">User Support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p11">If you contact WireMin User Support, any personal data you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p8">Device Information.</p><p class="p4">WireMin collects minimum device information, such as version number, platform, etc. All of this information is sent without association with the user account. WireMin App doesn't read or transfer the precise geo-location like GPS coordinates. Occasionally for WireMin App on mobile devices, an additional device notification token (e.g. iOS devices) may be collected, to enable push notifications. Again, that information is collected without exposing user identity or the device's IP which eliminates the possibility of user tracking.</p><p class="p8">Diagnostics Information.</p><p class="p6">WireMin may optionally collect information to diagnose crashes and malfunctions of the apps. All of the information has no association with the user account or user identity. Collecting that information may expose your device's IP depending on third-party debugging service providers. WireMin allows opt-out of such collections.</p><p class="p14"><strong>Information We May Share</strong></p><p class="p11">We don't have user information of any sort, so nothing will be shared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p8">Third Parties.</p><p class="p4">WireMin leverages third parties to achieve a better user experience and improve the stability of the App.</p><p class="p5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p4">• We employed Apple Push Service and Google Push Service for messaging notifications when the WireMin is not running. Both services require platform-specific device identifiers to be sent to these third parties, which can be turned off by disabling Push Notification.</p><p class="p5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p4">• We optionally collect crash point information based on third-party services (Firebase for the mobile platform and Sentry for the desktop platform). It can be turned off by navigating to Personal &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Allow Sending Diagnostics.</p><p class="p5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p11">WireMin restrictedly sends data to these third parties. All data is anonymous and does not contain any information related to your account or message content.</p><p class="p8">External Websites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p11">You may open a URL, which leads you to a third-party website that is displayed in WireMin apps. Their Terms and Privacy Policies govern your use of those services.</p><p class="p8">Other Instances where WireMin may Need to Share</p><p class="p4">• To meet applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.</p><p class="p4">• To enforce applicable Terms, including investigation of potential violations.</p><p class="p4">• To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p><p class="p6">• To protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of WireMin, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p><p class="p14"><strong>Updates</strong></p><p class="p6">We will update this Privacy Policy as needed so that it is updated, accurate, and as clear as possible.
