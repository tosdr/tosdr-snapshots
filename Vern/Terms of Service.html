		<li>Respect the American and Canadian legislation. Some examples of unacceptable behavior in accordance to the law include, but are not limited to: harassment, scam attempts, and unauthorized copying and/or distribution of copyrighted content.</li>
		<li>Due to online privacy laws such as COPPA, you must be 13 years or older to sign up for ~vern. Additionally if you are from the EU, you have to be at least 16 years of age as mandated by the GDPR.</li>
		<li>Any and all software or <b>original</b> and <b>nontrivial</b> user content hosted on <b>our servers</b> must be licensed under a free (as in freedom) license.</li>
		<li>No discrimination of any kind. Repeated violations of this rule even after warning will result in a ban.</li>
