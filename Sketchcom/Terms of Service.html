However, You grant Sketch B.V. a limited and non-exclusive license, revocable by You at any time by giving 14 days’ prior notice, to use Your business logo on Sketch B.V.’s marketing website for the purpose of presenting sample customers of the Sketch Platform in a neutral way. Sketch B.V. is allowed to use Your logo for this purpose only and the license granted herein is not transferable nor sublicensable. Sketch B.V. may also include a quote drafted by You relating to the service hereunder to be published in press releases. Such quote must be agreed on beforehand by You and Sketch B.V..</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The license granted under clause 3.1 remains effective until such Agreement is suspended or terminated in accordance with clause 14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch B.V. grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, revocable right to access and use the Sketch Platform in accordance with the Agreement, subject to Your payment of applicable fees under this Agreement. Sketch B.V. reserves all rights not expressly granted to You.</p>

</ol>

<h3 id="sketch-platform-subscription">Sketch Platform subscription</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If You register directly on Sketch B.V.’s website, You can start a trial of the Sketch Platform and create a Workspace in the Web app via <a href="/home">www.sketch.com</a>. Once You have created a Workspace, You are the Admin for that Workspace. In case of a Business Plan, you may be assigned a Sketch customer success manager (depending on the number of Editor’s seats purchased) who will assist You with the onboarding process and will further support You with priority support in accordance with clause 8.6 of these Terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After confirming Your agreement with our Terms of Service, You can trial the Sketch Platform for a one-time, limited term of 30 (thirty) consecutive days for the sole purpose of testing and evaluating Sketch. Upon expiration of the trial, You will be prompted for payment information in order to convert Your trial into a paid subscription, and You will need to reconfirm acceptance of our Terms of Service. Sketch B.V. will charge Your designated payment method for the coming period so that You can keep using the Sketch Platform. In case You don’t convert your trial into a paid subscription, You acknowledge and agree that Sketch B.V. may delete all of your content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to Your trial, provided that You will be granted 90 (ninety) days from the end of the trial to recover the files. Also, Sketch B.V. reserves the right to modify the terms of service of any trial and/or cancel any trial subscription at any time. If You are purchasing the Sketch Platform via or thanks to a third-party Partner, the free trial referenced in this clause 4.2 and in the preceding clause 4.1 won’t apply to Your purchase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for our services be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax. The fees displayed on Sketch B.V.’s pricing page are applicable for direct purchases made on sketch.com and may vary on third-party merchant platforms. You acknowledge and agree that any and all bank fees associated with the payment of fees under this Agreement shall be Your sole responsibility. Sketch B.V. shall not be liable for any costs, charges, or expenses incurred by You in connection with banking transactions, including but not limited to wire transfer fees, currency conversion fees, or any other similar charges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If You are the Admin for a Workspace, You can: (a) invite individuals for Your Workspace and assign them the role of Admin, Editor, Viewer, Guest or the Finance Role via www.sketch.com, (b) assign yourself the role of Editor or Viewer, (c) You can revoke the assigned role of Editor or Viewer with immediate effect and (d) You can request and manage the Restricted Upload feature. If You are the Workspace Owner You can, inter alia: (a) request the deletion of a Workspace; (b) request a change of Plan; (c) transfer document between Workspaces; (d) issue data deletion requests; (e) request and manage the Restricted Upload feature; and (f) access My Drafts in case a user is removed from a Workspace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If You are an Editor in a Workspace, You are granted a license to Use the Mac app for the term that You are an Editor. Each Editor in a Workspace can use their own Sketch Account to log into the Sketch Platform on any device they own; however, sharing credentials to access and use the Sketch Platform is a violation of this Agreement, including its clause 10.2, and may result in Sketch B.V. suspending Your Sketch Account and terminating this Agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If You are a Viewer or a Guest in a Workspace, You can review Content and post Comments, but You cannot access the Mac app or upload Content to the Web app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promotions that may be run by Sketch B.V., whether via email, on websites, social media platforms or otherwise, are subject to these Terms and to any other specific rule that might include duration, entry instructions and specific details, rules or conditions relating to a particular Promotion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Our subscriptions refund policy depends on the billing option You chose during the sign- up process:
    <ul>
      <li>For monthly billing, we don’t offer refunds, but You can cancel at any time, You won’t be billed again and You can use Your account until it expires;</li>
      <li>For annual billing, we offer a full refund within 30 days of Your initial purchase. Subsequent purchases, such as additional seats and renewals, are not refundable. To request a refund on an annual billing charge, You can contact our <a href="/support/contact/">Customer Support</a> following the instructions detailed in our <a href="/support/billing-and-plans/billing/refunds/">Refund Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if You fail to prove your identity as the Workspace Owner within 30 days of Your purchase, the refund request may be rejected at Sketch’s sole discretion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If You are given access to Beta Features, You are not obligated to use them and Sketch B.V. may immediately and without notice remove Your access to such Beta Features for any reason without liability to You.

      <li>If Sketch B.V. discontinues Your use of the Sketch Platform or terminates the Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice (including email) to You.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    <p>Sketch B.V. is entitled to terminate any subscriptions for the Sketch Platform, including trials, during the license term with immediate effect and without prior notice in the event You fail to comply with the Agreement or applicable laws and regulations, in the event You fail to pay Your fee for the applicable payment term, or in the event Sketch B.V. is required to do so by law or an order of an applicable court or other authoritative body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch B.V. may suspend Your access to and Your use of the Sketch Platform and terminate this Agreement immediately in writing (including email or text message), without prior written notice (i) if You fail to comply with any term(s) and conditions of the Agreement, (ii) on becoming aware of any potential violation of the Agreement. Sketch B.V. relies on third-party payment processors. In case You dispute a payment with one of such third-party payment processors and You lose such dispute, You will have to reach out to Sketch B.V. to reactivate Your subscription contacting Sketch B.V. at <a href="mailto:mail@sketch.com">mail@sketch.com</a> or, if You have purchased a Business Plan subscription, contacting Your customer success manager, if applicable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any terms and conditions of the Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including but not limited to payment obligations stemming from entering into this Agreement (as described in clause 2.2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You and Sketch B.V. waive their rights to rescind or annul the Agreement. Articles 3:44, 6:228 and 6:265 of the Dutch Civil Code are excluded.</p>

    <p>b) Your right to access and use the Sketch Platform shall terminate;</p>

    <p>c) any other rights granted to You under the Agreement shall immediately be relinquished by You;</p>

    <p>d) unless agreed otherwise in writing with Sketch B.V., Sketch B.V. will deactivate and delete Your Sketch Account(s) and data; and</p>

    <p>e) You shall promptly return to Sketch B.V. all Sketch Platform and Sketch’s Confidential Information in Your or any of Your employees’, agents’, subcontractors’ or (external) advisors’ possession, without withholding any copies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By entering into this Agreement, You agree to the automatic renewal of Your subscription until You choose to cancel.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may not assign or subcontract any of Your rights or obligations under the Agreement to any third party without Sketch B.V.’s prior written consent. Sketch B.V. may assign or subcontract any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement at its sole discretion.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A failure by Sketch B.V. to give notice to You of any breach or non-fulfillment of any provision, term or clause of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall the waiver of any breach or non-fulfillment of any provision, term or clause hereof constitute a waiver of any other provision, term or clause thereof.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersedes all other agreements between Sketch B.V. and You relating to its subject matter (whether oral or written and whether expressed or implied). You expressly agree that any different or additional terms set forth in any purchase order, portal, code of conduct, or other similar documentation provided by You shall not be applicable in the relationship between You and Sketch B.V. even if signed, acknowledged or accepted by Sketch B.V., unless Sketch B.V. specifically references this clause and waives its rights.</p>
