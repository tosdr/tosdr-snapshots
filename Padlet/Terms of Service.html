          <h1 class="no_toc" id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: Dec 6, 2021</em></p>

<p>You are now reading Padlet’s Terms of Service, meaning the contract between you and Padlet when you use Padlet’s site, services, and products.</p>

<h2 id="accepting-the-terms-of-service">Accepting the Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Please read these Terms of Service, our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="/content">Content Policy</a> (collectively, the “Agreement”) carefully before using Padlet.com (the “Site”) and/or the other domains, products, services, and/or content provided by Wallwisher, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site, the “Services”) (Wallwisher, Inc., a Delaware corporation, collectively with its agents, consultants, employees, officers and directors, “Padlet,” “we,” or “us”). By using or accessing the Services, you (“Subscriber” or “you”) agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="modifications-to-this-agreement">Modifications to this Agreement</h2>

<p>Padlet reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Agreement at any time by posting a revised Agreement through the Services and by providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via e-mail where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification in your Padlet Profile). You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement. Modifications are effective when posted, and your use of the Services following any such posted modification and notice of same constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified. Note that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below) prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time Padlet received your prepayment. If Padlet entered into a Master Agreement with you, the terms of the Master Agreement shall prevail.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-the-services">Use of the Services</h2>

<p>Padlet is not currently directed to children under the age of 13 and such children may  only use the Padlet Services with guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.  In the United States, if You are the sponsor of a Sponsored Group (the “Sponsor”), including a School that is using Padlet, that includes children under the age of 13, You (or Your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). The  Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Service the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Service. You represent and warrant that you have the proper authority to designate and, as a result of engaging with the Padlet Services do hereby designate,  Padlet a “school official” within the meaning of FERPA. Padlet will be under your direction with respect to the use and maintenance of personally identifiable information and education records, as those terms are defined by FERPA, and we may use personally identifiable information and education records only as set forth under these Terms. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>. If You are outside of the United States, You are responsible to comply with  any laws applicable to You before submitting any child’s personal information or permitting any child to submit personal information to Padlet.</p>

<p><strong>Service Changes and Limitations:</strong> The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to You. Padlet retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Padlet may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict Your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. Padlet may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below).</p>

<p><strong>Limitations on Automated Use:</strong> You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (a) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Padlet and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Padlet (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless You have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Padlet, or unless permitted by Padlet’s robots.txt file or other robot exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape Content (as defined below) from the Services, without Padlet’s express prior written consent; (e) use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or e-mail headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>

<h2 id="registration-padlet-urls-and-security">Registration, Padlet URLs, and Security</h2>

<p>As a condition to using certain of the Services, You may be required to create an account (an “ <strong>Account</strong>”) and select a password and Padlet username. You may also select new Padlet URLs for each blog You create. You must provide Padlet with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly e-mail address, and failure to do so may result in suspension of Your Account.</p>

<p>You agree that You shall not select or use as a Padlet URL a name of another person or entity with the intent to impersonate that person or entity or with the intent to otherwise cause confusion as to the origin or provenance of Your Account. Padlet reserves the right to refuse registration of, cancel, or modify a Padlet URL in its sole discretion.</p>

<p>You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Account password and for the security of your Account, and You will notify Padlet immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Your Account or Account password.</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

<p>Any information you provide to Padlet is subject to Padlet’s <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>) of this information.</p>

<h2 id="content-and-subscriber-content">Content and Subscriber Content</h2>

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong> For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term “Content” means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies, and comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, and interactive features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services; (2) the term “Subscriber Content” is all Content that is posted or otherwise provided or transferred to the Services by a Subscriber (including, without limitation, by You); and Content also includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.</p>

<p><strong>Ownership:</strong> Subscribers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in their Subscriber Content.  Padlet and the applicable  third parties retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in the Padlet Services and all Content other than Subscriber Content.</p>

<p><em>You retain ownership of any intellectual property You post to Padlet</em></p>
