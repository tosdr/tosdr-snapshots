          <p>This policy has been approved by the Executive Committee and any amendments to it require the Committee's approval.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-81e1">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="1-1-purpose-08b9">1.1 Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this IT Acceptable Use Policy is to outline the acceptable use of all IT resources, including computer hardware and software, network systems, internet access, email systems, and other electronic communication systems, by students, employees, contractors, and third-party service providers at the University of Bath. This policy aims to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the University's IT resources, and to promote responsible and ethical behaviour when using these resources.</p>

<h2 id="1-2-scope-a607">1.2 Scope</h2>

<p>Members of the University and all other users (staff, students, visitors, contractors and others) of the University's facilities are bound by the provisions of its policies in addition to this Acceptable Use Policy. The University of Bath seeks to promote and facilitate the positive and extensive use of Information Technology in the interests of supporting the delivery of learning, teaching, innovation and research to the highest possible standards. This also requires appropriate and legal use of the technologies and facilities made available to students, staff and partners of the University.</p>

<h1 id="2-acceptable-use-policy-c69b">2 Acceptable use policy</h1>

<h2 id="2-1-acceptable-use-5677">2.1 Acceptable Use</h2>

<p><strong>2.1.1</strong> Users are encouraged to use the IT facilities to further the goals and objectives of their work, study or research and in accordance with the Dignity and Respect policy. Subject to all of the following, the University permits personal use of the IT facilities as a privilege, not a right with the below condition: </p>

<ul>
<li>It does not interfere with the member of staff’s work nor the student’s study;</li>
<li>It does not contravene any University policies; and</li>
<li>It is not excessive in its use of resource</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.1.2</strong> All users of the University's IT resources must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including but not limited to the Data Protection Act 2018, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the University's Information Security Policy. </p>

<p><strong>2.1.3</strong> The University has a statutory duty (the Prevent Duty), under Section 26(1) of the Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015, to act to stop members of its community from being drawn into terrorism. In order to comply with this duty, the University reserves the right to monitor or block access to material that might incite extremism, radicalisation or violence. Anyone needing to access security sensitive material for legitimate academic purposes must register via the Ethics Review Process.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.4</strong> All users of the University's IT resources are responsible for maintaining the security of these resources by using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and reporting any suspicious activity to the IT department.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.5</strong> The University respects the privacy of its users and expects all users to respect the privacy of others. Any unauthorised access, use, or disclosure of personal information is strictly prohibited.  </p>

<p><strong>2.1.6</strong> Users must comply with any request made to them by university staff in connection with the enforcement of this policy.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.7</strong> Users shall not use the IT facilities inappropriately. See 2.2 for the unacceptable use examples.</p>

<h2 id="2-2-unacceptable-use-d788">2.2 Unacceptable Use</h2>

<p><strong>2.2.1</strong> Subject to exemptions defined in 2.2.8, the University IT Systems may not be used directly or indirectly by a User for the download, creation, manipulation, transmission or storage of:</p>

<ol>
<li>any offensive, obscene or indecent images, data or other material, or any data capable of being resolved into obscene or indecent images or material;</li>
<li>unlawful material or material that is defamatory, threatening, discriminatory, extremist or which has the potential to radicalise themselves or others; </li>
<li>any material which promotes terrorism or violent extremism, or which seeks to radicalise individuals to such causes;</li>
<li>unsolicited and unauthorised bulk email (spam) which is unrelated to the legitimate business of the University. For the surveying of students, please refer to the protocol;</li>
<li>material which is subsequently used to facilitate harassment, bullying and/or victimisation of a member of the University or a third party;</li>
<li>material which promotes discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation;</li>
<li> material with the intent to defraud or which is likely to deceive a third party;</li>
<li>material which advocates or promotes any unlawful act;</li>
<li>material that infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of a third party, or that is in breach of a legal duty owed to another party; or</li>
<li>material that brings the University into disrepute.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2.2.2</strong> The University networks must not be deliberately used by a User for activities having, or likely to have, any of the following characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Accessing or attempting to access unauthorised information or resources. </li>
<li>Sharing passwords or other access credentials with others.</li>
