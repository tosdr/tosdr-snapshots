<h1 id="understanding-data-protection">Understanding Data Protection</h1>

<p>While you are a student at the University of Bath and after you cease to be a student, the University needs to collect, store, use and disclose certain data about you for purposes connected with your studies, including providing services to applicants, current students and alumni.</p>

<p>By registering at the University of Bath as a student, you consent to the University collecting, storing, using and disclosing data about you for any purposes connected with your studies, your health and safety and for other legitimate reasons while you are a student, and also for certain purposes after you cease to be student, and as detailed in this document.</p>

<p>When we process data about you, we have to observe the requirements of the <a href="/corporate-information/data-protection-act/">Data Protection Act</a>. The Act establishes a framework within which information about individuals can be legally collected, stored, used and disclosed. This statement is designed to highlight the areas of Data Protection which are particularly relevant to you, and to help you understand how information about you will be collected, stored, used and disclosed. It applies to all students regardless of age, so if you are under 18, you will be treated in the same way as students who are over 18 for Data Protection purposes.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-data-will-be-used">How the data will be used</h1>

<p>The University will only use your data fairly and lawfully in accordance with our obligations under the <a href="/corporate-information/data-protection-act/">Data Protection Act</a>. This means that we will process your data in a way which respects the Data Protection Principles set down in the Act and your rights under the Act.</p>

<p>The <a href="/corporate-information/data-protection-act/">Data Protection Act</a> requires us to keep your data secure. This means that your confidentiality will be respected, and all appropriate measures will be taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure.</p>

<p>Although it is not possible to state every purpose for which your information will be used, the following are examples of how it is likely to be used while you are a student:</p>

<ul>
<li>To administer your studies and record academic achievements (e.g., your unit choices, examinations and assessments, and the publication of pass lists) </li>
<li>To assist in pastoral and welfare needs (e.g., Therapeutic, Mental Health & Wellbeing services, services to students with disabilities, and support for students with low or non-engagement with their programme of study)</li>
<li>In the event of medical needs or emergencies, for example where we have reason to believe that you or another person may suffer harm</li>
<li>To administer financial aspects of your registration as a student (e.g., payment of fees, debt collection) </li>
<li>To manage course facilities, such as computing facilities, sports facilities and clubs, and the Library </li>
<li>To produce management statistics and to conduct research into the effectiveness of our courses and services </li>
<li>To monitor our equality and diversity policies (e.g., compliance with the Equality Act) </li>
<li>To contact you with tailored placement and careers opportunities </li>
<li>To communicate relevant support or other group-specific information direct to applicable students </li>
<li>Text messaging for relevant activities or reminders about surveys, e.g., NSS. </li>

<li>For security and disciplinary purposes </li>
<li>For internal and external audits, and quality assurance exercises </li>
<li>For marketing and alumni relations purposes </li>
</ul>

<p>Much of this data will be held in written (paper or electronic) form. However, the University also takes photographs on campus and during events and may record lectures, seminars, tutorials, presentations and other events. The student data captured or held may therefore include visual images of students and audio recordings of their voices. As the University may record lectures and other events, such as presentations delivered by its staff or students, such recordings will include words spoken by students or performances given by them. You are also giving us permission to record any words that you may speak or performances that you may give in lectures, presentations or other events which are recorded and also consent to us making any such recordings available to other students in accordance with our Intellectual Property Policy.</p>

<p>The University also records its graduation ceremonies and makes these recordings available via its website.  By taking part in the graduation ceremony you are giving us your permission to do so.</p>

It is designed to gather students' views on the quality of the teaching, assessment and support which they have experienced. This information is used to produce statistics and provide summary feedback to individual institutions and student unions. The survey is commissioned by the <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/">Office for Students (OfS)</a> on behalf of a range of funding bodies and Higher Education providers and can be found on the <a href="https://www.thestudentsurvey.com/">National Student Survey</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-student-surveys-04d7">Other Student Surveys</h3>

<p>In other cases, the University will not release data about you to bodies or individuals who have funded your education (such as your parents or employer), unless you tell us that we can do so. However, if you are under 18 years of age you consent to the University advising your parents as to the amount and nature of any debts you owe to the University from time to time.</p>

This will be done for the administration of the visit, exchange or study abroad, and so that the other institution can carry out its duties in regard to your studies.

<h1 id="uk-visas-and-immigration">UK Visas and Immigration</h1>

<p>This section applies to students who require a visa to enter the UK to study at the University.</p>

<p>To assist in preventing immigration fraud, the University is required to report to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)</a> details of students subject to immigration control who fail to register, who discontinue their studies or who fail to maintain contact with the University. We may also be required to provide UKVI with other information about students. From time to time, the University also receives enquiries from UK immigration officials regarding the status of applicants or students, e.g., to check whether an offer of a place has been made or whether a student has enrolled.</p>

<p>The University will normally provide information about applicants and students when requested to do so by UK immigration officials. Failure to do so, in some cases, could lead to the University's removal from the list of institutions approved to receive overseas students. We will maintain the records about students (e.g., attendance) which we are required to maintain to meet UKVI's requirements.</p>
