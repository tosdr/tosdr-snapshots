                    CloudConvert is a universal app for file conversions. Amongst
                    others, we do offer tools to convert files to other formats, to create
                    website screenshots, to merge files, to create thumbnails and to add
                    watermarks to files. The service is both available as website and REST API
                    for integration in other services.
                    The service can be used both without and with optional registration.

                <p>
                    By visiting our website and/or using our API, your IP address will be
                    logged, along with the HTTP referrer, the user agent, and the dates of
                    access (log data).

                <p>
                    In the course of providing the service, your selected files are transferred

                    The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the

                    We use the IP address and other information provided by the user (in
                    particular postcode in the context of registration or ordering) for
                    regional targeting (so-called "geotargeting").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regional targeting is used, for example, to automatically select servers that are geographically
                    nearest to users. The legal
                    basis for the use of the IP address and, if applicable, other information
                    provided by the user (in particular postcode) is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, based
                    on our interest in ensuring best performance and transfer speed for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the process, part of the IP address and the additional information
                    provided by the user (in particular postcode) are merely read out and not
                    stored separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can prevent geotargeting by using, for example, a VPN or proxy server
                    that prevents precise localisation. In addition, depending on the browser
                    used, you can also deactivate location localisation in the corresponding
                    browser settings (insofar as this is supported by the respective browser).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use geotargeting on our platform for the following purposes:

                <ul>
