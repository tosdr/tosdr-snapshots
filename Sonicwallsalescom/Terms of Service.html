remedy such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice in writing from Sonictek
requiring the Buyer to do so;
	
</p>

</p>
<p><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>5. DELIVERY </strong>
</p>
<p>5.1 Unless otherwise
agreed in writing with an Authorised Officer the costs of packing and delivery
(including costs of carriage, cases and materials) shall be for the Buyer’s
account. If Sonictek pays for or incurs all or part of such costs, it shall
invoice its costs so incurred to the Buyer at the date of dispatch. If Sonictek

Buyer at Sonictek’s standard rate then in force.
	
</p>
<p>5.2 The Buyer
warrants the details of any address for delivery stipulated by the Buyer. Sonictek

deliveries where the recipient is not available or is unwilling to accept the
Goods (such charges to cover the loss of profit incurred by Sonictek).

for the delivery of the Goods are approximate only and Sonictek shall not be
liable for any loss, direct or indirect, which may arise from delay in Delivery
of the Goods howsoever caused. Time for Delivery shall not be of the essence
and the Buyer shall not be entitled to cancel the Contract by virtue of late
Delivery. The estimated Delivery time shall be calculated as from the date of Sonictek’s
acceptance of the Buyer’s Order and (where required by Sonictek) any payment,
samples, information, licenses and consents necessary to proceed with the Order
have been supplied by the Buyer. Changed specifications or instructions may
result in changes to estimated Delivery times.
	
</p>
<p>5.4 The Goods may be
delivered in instalments. Each delivery shall constitute a separate Contract
and failure by Sonictek to deliver any one or more of the instalments (or
faulty Goods) in accordance with these Conditions or any claim by the Buyer in
respect of any one or more instalments shall not entitle the Buyer to treat the
Contract as repudiated. 
	
</p>
<p>5.5 If the Buyer’s
carrier or other third party nominated by the Buyer fails to take receipt of
the Goods after being notified that the Goods are ready for Delivery or fails
to give Sonictek adequate Delivery instructions at the time stated for Delivery
or has requested a delay in Delivery or the Buyer is unable to give access to
its premises for the purposes of Delivery or installation then Sonictek may at
the risk and expense of the Buyer:
	
</p>
<p>5.5.1 store the Goods
until actual Delivery and charge the
	
</p>
<p>Buyer for the costs
(including insurance and transport costs) of storage and re-Delivery; or
	
</p>
<p>5.5.2 sell the Goods
at the best price readily obtainable and (after deducting all storage, selling
and other expenses) account to the Buyer for the excess over sums owing by the
Buyer or charge the Buyer for any shortfall. The date of the Goods being put
into storage shall be deemed to be the date of Delivery and, unless the Goods
have already been paid for, the Buyer shall be invoiced for the Goods at that
date. Once the Goods are in storage, Sonictek will not have any obligation to
take any further steps in relation to the Goods, unless and until has received
full written instruction from the Buyer.
	
</p>

to be exported out of the 
	<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">United
  Kingdom

any special terms agreed in writing between the Buyer and the Sonictek) apply
notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions:

</p>

be responsible for complying with any legislation or regulations governing the
importation of the Goods into the country of destination and for the payment of
any duties thereon.

would be apparent on inspection and which are made after shipment, or in
respect of any damage during transit.
	
</p>

not be entitled to withhold payment of the price for the Goods due to the
Buyer’s failure to comply with the provisions of this clause.
	
</p>
<p>(vii) The Goods will
be packaged in accordance with the Sonictek’s standard practice, and the
packaging shall meet any reasonably requirements stipulated in advance by any
independent contractors or shippers.
	
</p>
<p>5.7 The Buyer’s
failure to make due payment in respect of any deliveries or instalments under
any Contract shall entitle Sonictek to delay, suspend or cancel deliveries in
whole or in part as its option.
	
</p>
<p>5.8 In no case shall
any dispute concerning (1) any item or separate part of the Goods or work (2)
any other contractual obligation or liability of Sonictek to the Buyer affect
the Buyer’s obligation in respect of payments to be made under these Conditions

<p><strong>17. SECURITY AS A
SERVICE (SECAAS)
	</strong>
</p>
<p>17.1 Payments for the
service will be monthly in advance. All contracts are for a minimum of 24
months. After the initial 24 month period the unit can be returned or we will
continue to bill at the monthly sum already agreed. 3 months’ written notice of
cancellation is needed. Contracts cannot be cancelled within the subscription
period. The appliances and associated services will remain the property of Sonictek,

month period, the “Evergreen” program can be taken advantage of. After the
contracted period all units must be returned to Sonictek unless otherwise
agreed. An individual order for each security appliance must be raised for the
full amount of the subscription term. e.g. for a firewall or a firewall with
service(s) costing £100 per month over a 24 month period an order for £2400
payable as 24 x £100 monthly payment would have to be raised

non-payment or a returned subscription payment. The full cost of the minimum
