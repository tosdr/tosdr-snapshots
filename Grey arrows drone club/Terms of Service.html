<p>Competitions held by Grey Arrows Drone Club are skills-based and require a question to be answered. Entrants who successfully answer a question are entered in to a prize draw.  Grey Arrows Drone Club has a reasonable expectation that skill, judgment or knowledge of the prize is required to enter the competition. Entry to the Competition is only available to Club <a href="https://greyarro.ws/faq#membership">members</a> residing in the UK with an active membership subscription.  Non-members and non-UK residents are not eligible to enter.</p>
<p>Entry to a Competition can only be made online via <a href="https://dronescene.co.uk/competitions">https://dronescene.co.uk/competitions</a> and ticket purchases can only be made using a debit or credit card.</p>

<p>Each Competition has a Start Date, an End Date and a Draw Date. Tickets may only be purchased during the period between the Start Date and the End Date of the Competition.</p>
<p>Prizes are non-transferable and no cash alternative prize is available.</p>
<p>Entrants who successfully answer a question will have their ticket(s) entered in to a prize draw to choose a winner.

A live-chat will also be available during the live draw, the link to which will also be made available at the time.
