All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.

Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently and forever barred. This one (1) year period includes the thirty (30) day pre-dispute procedure set forth in Section 24(a) above.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>e. Improperly Filed Claims. </strong>All claims you bring against WetHunt must be resolved in accordance with this Section.
