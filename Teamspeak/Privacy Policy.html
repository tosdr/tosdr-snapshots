<h3><a name="_Toc524517583"></a><a name="_Toc524359593"></a>18. Warranty</h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">18.1 The statutory warranty rights apply to consumers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">18.2 The following provisions shall apply to entrepreneurs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">18.2.1 The customer&#39;s warranty rights expire within one year. This does not apply to damages culpably caused by TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> from injury to life, body or health and grossly negligent or deliberately caused damages or fraudulent intent, as well as to recourse claims according to &sect;&sect; 478, 479 BGB (German Civil Code).</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">18.2.2 Any warranty on the part of TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> is excluded if the defect is due to circumstances that TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> has caused at the express request of the customer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">18.2.3 The strict liability for damages for initial defects according to &sect; 536a Abs. 1 BGB (German Civil Code) is excluded.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc524517584"></a><a name="_Toc524359594"></a>19. Liability</h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">19.1 TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> is liable in all cases of contractual and non-contractual liability for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">19.2 In other cases TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> is only liable - as far as not differently regulated in clause 19.1 of these GTC - in case of violation of a contractual obligation, the fulfilment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the customer may therefore regularly rely (so-called cardinal obligation). In all other cases, TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span>&#39;s liability is excluded, subject to the provisions in Section 19.1 of these GTC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">19.3 As far as TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> is liable according to clause 19.1 of these GTC, this liability is limited to damages which TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> has foreseen as a possible consequence of a breach of contract at the time of conclusion of the contract or which should have been foreseen in case of application of customary care. Indirect damages and consequential damages resulting from defects in performance by TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> are only compensable if such damages are typically to be expected when the performance is used as intended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">19.4 The liability of TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> for damages from injury to life, body or health and according to the Product Liability Act remains unaffected by the above limitations and exclusions of liability.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc524517585"></a><a name="_Toc524359595"></a>20. Offsetting, rights of retention and assignment</h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">20.1 The customer is only entitled to offset against legally established or undisputed claims against TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span>. The same applies to the assertion of rights of retention.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">20.2 The assignment of claims against TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> to third parties is only possible with the written consent of TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span>.

<h3><a name="_Toc524517586"></a><a name="_Toc524359596"></a>21. Text form</h3>

<h3><a name="_Toc524517587"></a>22. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction</h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px">22.1 German law shall apply. In the case of consumers, this choice of law applies only insofar as the protection granted by mandatory provisions of the law of the country of the consumer&#39;s habitual residence is not withdrawn (principle of favourability).</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">22.2 The place of performance for all services arising from business relations with TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span> and the place of jurisdiction shall be the registered office of TeamSpeak<span class='ts-tm'>®</span>, provided that the User is not a consumer but a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law. The same applies if the user does not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or the EU or if his place of residence or usual abode is not known at the time the action is filed. The authority to appeal to the court at another legal place of jurisdiction remains unaffected by this.</p>
