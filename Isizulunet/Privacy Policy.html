<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This privacy policy is intended to inform the users of my website about the
nature, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data by me,
the website operator.</p>

<p>My website does not directly use or embed any external tools, services or
content. Operators of websites to which I have linked receive your data (IP
address, etc.) only when you (actively) click on the link I have set. Thus,
you decide for yourself whether and with whom you want to share your data.</p>

<h3>Collection and processing of personal data, type and purpose of use</h3>

<h4>Using the website</h4>

<p>When you visit my website, or use its OpenSearch interface or its API, your
web browser automatically transmits certain information to the server, which
could in turn make you identifiable. For example, your web browser transmits
the IP address assigned by your provider.  To provide the service, the web
server processes the following information and stores it in a logfile:</p>

<ul class=taleft>
<li>The <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address>IP address</a> of
the requesting computer, e.g.: <b>51.195.149.220</b></li>
<li>The API username if applicable, e.g.: <b>johndoe</b>
<li>The date and time of the request, e.g.: <b>20/Jun/2024:16:26:35</b></li>
<li>The HTTP request <a
href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods>method</a>,
e.g.: <b>GET</b></li>
<li>The requested <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax>URL
path</a>, e.g.: <b>/pvc/</b></li>
<li>The HTTP version used in the request, e.g.: <b>HTTP/1.1</b>
<li>The HTTP <a
href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Status_codes>status
code</a>, e.g.: <b>200</b></li>
<li>The number of bytes transmitted to your browser, e.g.: <b>5189</b></li>
<li>The requested <a
href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name>domain</a>, e.g.:
<b>isizulu.net</b></li>
<li>The website from which the request originated (<a
href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer>Referrer</a>), e.g.:
<b>https://duckduckgo.com/</b></li>
<li>The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your
computer (<a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent>user agent</a>),
e.g.:<br><b>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0</b></li>
<li>The <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>TLS
version</a> and <a href=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite>cipher
suite</a> used by your browser, e.g.:<br>
<b>TLSv1.3-TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256</b></li>
<li>The term(s) you looked up in the dictionary and corresponding
search sugggestions, if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click the "hide phonetic spelling" checkbox, a cookie is
exchanged between the server and your browser for the sole purpose of
remembering this setting.</p>

I use the aforementioned information for the following purposes:

<ul class=taleft>
<li>Ensuring secure and stable server operations</li>
<li>Accumulated, anonymized access statistics</li>
<li>Further administrative tasks like identification of orphaned links
or configuration errors</li>
</ul>

<p>The server logfiles are stored for up to 7 days. IP addresses and browser
identifiers are anonymized after 1 day.</p>

<h4>Using my contact address</h4>

<p>For inquiries not covered by the forum I offer you the possibility
to <a href="/contact/">contact</a> me by encrypted e-mail. In doing so, the
specification of a valid e-mail address is required so that I know from whom
the request originates and to be able to answer it. Further information can
be given voluntarily.</p>

<h4>Using the forum</h4>

<p>The forum is hosted and operated externally by Tapatalk and is subject to
their privacy policy. No data is exchanged between this website and the
forum.</p>

<h3>Data security and data processing</h3>

<p>All data processing of this website takes place on my own server located in
Germany. I have taken appropriate technical and organizational protective
measures to make it very difficult for potential attackers to compromise the
server.</p>

<p>When visiting this website, an encrypted connection is initiated via the
common TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol. The highest encryption level
(cipher suite) supported by your browser is used. You can tell whether an
individual page of my website is transmitted in encrypted form by the display
of a key or lock symbol in the URL line or status bar of your browser.</p>
