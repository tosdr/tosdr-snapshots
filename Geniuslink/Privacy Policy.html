          <H2 >1. Overview</H2>
          <P>GeoRiot (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;)
            provides a set of services (&ldquo;Genius Link Services&rdquo;) to
            commercial customers (&ldquo;Clients&rdquo;) for purposes of online
            marketing and sales of digital and physical products and services
            (&ldquo;Products&rdquo;) to individual consumers. The Genius Link
            Services are provided to Clients worldwide, including in the United
            States (&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;), the member states of the European Union
            (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;), and Switzerland. The Genius Link Services are
            provided under the names &ldquo;Genius Link&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;BookLinker.net.&rdquo; The Genius Link Services are not
            provided to individuals as consumers.</P>
          <P>The Genius Link Services are dynamic
            links that are used to connect consumers visiting or interacting with
            a Client&rsquo;s websites, applications, social media, electronic
            documents, eBooks, text messages and other online digital properties
            (&ldquo;Digital Properties&rdquo;) to retail websites (&ldquo;Storefronts&rdquo;)
            maintained by international goods and services retailers
            (&ldquo;Retailers&rdquo;) where Products identified on the Client&rsquo;s
            Digital Property (&ldquo;Products&rdquo;) can be purchased. These
            dynamic links are called &ldquo;Geni.us Links.&rdquo; Digital
            Properties including Geni.us Links are accessed through a personal
            computer, laptop, smartphone or other device providing Internet
            access through a browser (&ldquo;Device&rdquo;) when an individual
            follows the Geni.us Link to a Storefront.</P>
          <P>GeoRiot collects information that is
            or can be associated with a particular individual (&ldquo;Personal
            Information&rdquo;) automatically when an individual using a Device
            clicks a Geni.us Link in the course of viewing and interacting with
            content on a Client&rsquo;s Digital Properties (a &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;).
            Such an individual is referred to as a &ldquo;Buyer&rdquo; in this
            Policy. GeoRiot also collects Personal Information automatically
            about individuals who navigate to and browse the GeoRiot&rsquo;s
            website(s) (&ldquo;Site Visitors&rdquo;). Finally, GeoRiot collects
            Personal Information about individuals acting as or on behalf of
            Clients for purposes of the Genius Link Services (&ldquo;Client
            Users&rdquo;) in the course of Client account registration and in
            communications and transactions between the Client and GeoRiot. This
            Policy explains our data collection and privacy practices with
            respect to the Personal Information of Buyers, Site Visitors, and
            Client Users.</P>
          <h2 >2. Adherence to the Standard Contractual Clauses, GDPR &amp; UK Data Protection Laws, and California Consumer Privacy Act.</h2>
          <P>GeoRiot's and the Genius Link Services' collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the
            European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States by GeoRiot and Genius Link is conducted in
            compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers as approved by the European Commission pursuant to
            Decision C(2021)3701 (the "SCCs"), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 ("EU Regulations") and the
            UK GDPR and Data Protection Act of 2018 (UK Data Protection Laws). If there is any conflict between the terms in this
            Policy, the SCCs, EU Regulations and the UK Data Protection Laws, the SCCs, EU Regulations and the UK Data Protection
            Laws shall govern. To learn more about the SCCs, and to view the model agreement text, please visit
            http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/915/oj.</P>
          <P>While not all data described as Personal Information in this Policy is necessarily within the scope of information
            covered by the SCCs, the GDPR, EU Regulations and the UK Data Protection Laws, as a matter of prudence and due
            diligence and to help assure transparency, GeoRiot has elected to attest to its adherence to the SCCs, EU Regulations
            and the UK Data Protections Laws regarding all Personal Information that it collects and maintains, as described in
            this Policy. GeoRiot has also implemented policies and procedures to assure its compliance with the EU General Data
            Protection Directive to the extent it applies to Personal Information.</P>

          <h2 >3. Collection and Processing of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>Please note that GeoRiot does not provide any products or services to individuals acting in a personal capacity or
            engage in transactions or communications with them. GeoRiot only collects and uses information such as names,
            addresses or other contact information, governmental or corporate identification numbers, account numbers or images,
            or other information in connection with Client Users; and only collects and uses information such as username or email
            address, IP address, or other information in connection with Site Users who post a comment on our blog. GeoRiot does
            not combine Personal Information with other data to identify individuals for purposes of the Genius Link Services.</p>
          <p>Information collected through Geni.us Links and information collected about Site Visitors and Client Users is
            transferred to and stored by GeoRiot in the United States, according to GeoRiot's standard Data Retention policies. As
            a matter of due diligence and prudence, GeoRiot has taken appropriate measures to ensure the security, integrity and
            ethical use of such information, called "Potential Personal Information" for purposes of this Policy. GeoRiot does not
            combine Potential Personal Information with other data to identify individuals for purposes of the Services.</p>
          <p>Access to potential personal information is limited to only those who have been trained on rules and regulations
            pertaining to the handling of Potential Personal Information. While Potential Personal Information is not directly
            accessed, it may at times be shown internally during maintenance and troubleshooting operations.</p>
          <p>While Potential Personal Information may not be Personal Data within the meaning of GDPR or the UK Data Protection
            Laws, as a matter of prudence and due diligence and to help assure transparency, GeoRiot has elected to adhere to
            policies and procedures to assure its compliance with the E.U. General Data Protection Directive to the extent the
            GDPR and/or the UK Data Protection Laws apply to Potential Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>In an effort to minimize the burden on our clients and ourselves, we've stopped storing IP addresses, effective May
            9th, 2018, after the initial processing of the click.</p>

          <P>When a Buyer clicks a Geni.us Link
            the following information is collected automatically, as determined
            by the coding of the Geni.us Link by GeoRiot:</P>

                (&ldquo;Device Data&rdquo;).</P>

            <LI>
              <P><I>Dynamic Links.</I>&nbsp;A
                Client can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate
                Retailer website based on information such as the user&rsquo;s
                location, device, and language set in the browser. This may include
                dynamic links on a Client&rsquo;s Digital Property which
                automatically populate a Storefront customized for the Buyer on the
                Digital Property. For example, a Client website that reviews
                technology devices may display related products with links to
                purchase them on Retailer Amazon&rsquo;s Storefront. The Geni.us
                Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the
                Client&rsquo;s website is directed appropriately based on the
                Buyer&rsquo;s location.</P>
            <LI>
              <P><I>Automatic Product
                Localization.</I>&nbsp;A Client can use a single link to
                automatically route Buyers to the appropriate Product in the Buyer&rsquo;s
                local Storefront, such as the Amazon, iTunes, or Microsoft online
                stores. Automatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from
                the correct local Retailer&rsquo;s Storefront. For example, a Buyer
                in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us
                Link from a Client website, and the Client might earn a commission
                through the Amazon Germany affiliate program.</P>

              <P><I>Choice Pages.</I>&nbsp;A

                an automated process pick for them.</P>

              <P><I>Retargeting.</I>&nbsp;The

            directly with individuals, since its presence on its Clients&rsquo;
            Digital Properties is limited to the Geni.us Link(s) in/on the
            Client&rsquo;s Digital Properties. GeoRiot therefore contractually
            requires its Clients to ensure their compliance with any legal
            requirements for notification to and consent by individuals with
            respect to their data collection and use practices, as required in
            their applicable jurisdictions.</P>
          <P><A NAME="Bookmark1"></A>In addition,
            GeoRiot contractually requires its Clients to comply with the Network
            Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct where it is applicable to
            their business. In particular, if a Client attempts to combine data
            about an individual from other sources with GeoRiot Personal
            Information, it is required to notify the affected individuals and
            obtain their opt-in consent in accordance with the NAI Code of
            Conduct. If a Client collects data for interest-based advertising, it
            is required to clearly and conspicuously post a notice consistent
            with the NAI Code that contains:</P>

          <P><B>Buyers</B></P>
          <P>GeoRiot principally collects
            information through transactions that occur as part of &ldquo;Link
            Localization.&rdquo; In this process a Geni.us Link which promotes or
            sells a product is posted on a Client&rsquo;s Digital Property, and
            automatically points to a Retailer&rsquo;s online Storefront
            designated by the Client. When a Buyer clicks the Geni.us Link,
            Personal Information is collected and transmitted to GeoRiot&rsquo;s
            servers. This information is automatically analyzed to identify the
            location and type of Device being used to access the link. Based on
            this information, the Geni.us Link automatically redirects the Device
            to a web page in regional or country-specific storefront of the
            Retailer (&ldquo;Localized Page&rdquo;) which promotes or sells the
            product.</P>
          <P>GeoRiot does not create or
            administer either its Clients&rsquo; Digital Properties or Retailers&rsquo;
            Storefront pages, does not provide content for either, and does not
            sell or promote products on either. The only information GeoRiot
            collects from either the Digital Property or the Storefront is that
            provided in response to the click on the Genius Link.</P>
          <P>GeoRiot may collect and process the
            following information from the Device used to click on the Geni.us
            Link:</P>
          <UL>
            <LI>
              <P><A NAME="_Hlk514509101"></A><A NAME="Bookmark2"></A> User Agent Information which identifies the Device, operating system
                and browser used by the Device in use. </P>
          </UL>
          <UL>
            <LI>
              <P>Location Information, which is
                the IP address of the Device used in the Transaction. The IP address
                provides network information, which can often be used to determine
                the country, state and sometimes city and postal code where the
                Device is in use. Location Information is treated as if it were
                Personal Information. However, GeoRiot typically deletes Location
                Information within five minutes of the click, and does not maintain
                or store such data beyond that time period.</P>
            <LI>
              <P>Language Information, which is
                the language associated with the Device&rsquo;s browser. </P>

            <LI>
              <P>Product Information, which is
                identification information for Products the Device was used to view. </P>

                Transaction (&ldquo;Limited Purchase Information&rdquo;). Limited
                Purchase Information is collected and provided to GeoRiot by
                Clients, who are responsible for ensuring that any individual
                consent or authorization required for its use by GeoRiot has been
                obtained. </P>
          </UL>
          <P>GeoRiot does not collect any other

            are only offered with respect to individuals who are 18 years of age
            or older. GeoRiot does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal
            Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no
            aspect of the Genius Link Services is designed to attract people
            under the age of 13. If GeoRiot obtains knowledge that a Buyer is
            under the age of 13, GeoRiot will remove Personal Information with
            respect to that individual from its databases.</P>

          <P>When a Client creates a GeoRiot

            communicate with GeoRiot as or on behalf of a Client (&ldquo;Client
            Users&rdquo;). This information may include Client User name, email
            addresses, and potentially other information used to communicate with
            the Client User, as well as the content of communications between
            GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client User

          <H3 >e. Consumer Access to Potential Personal Information</H3>
          <p>The Potential Personal Information GeoRiot maintains after processing a geni.us Link click is limited to User Agent
            Information, Language Information, Client URL, Product Information, Limited Purchase Information and Third Party
            Product Information. The only information maintained by GeoRiot which might in principle allow identification of an
            individual Consumer is User Agent Information and Limited Purchase information, which would have to be combined with
            other information from third parties which is not available to GeoRiot in order to allow identification of an
            individual Consumer.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot therefore can only provide a Consumer with an opportunity to review and request that GeoRiot update or delete
            their Personal Data included in Potential Personal Information if the Consumer can provide GeoRiot with additional
            information regarding the Consumer's association with specific User Agent Information and/or Limited Purchase
            Information for GeoRiot to identify the Consumer with specific Potential Personal Information in GeoRiot's control,
            with a reasonably high degree of reliability. In the event a Consumer provides such information, GeoRiot will upon
            request allow them to review and request that GeoRiot update or delete Potential Personal Information to the extent
            the information can be identified to the individual Consumer or is identifiable to a specific Device used by the
            Consumer for the Transaction(s) for which the information was collected.
          </p>
          <p>For additional information and to request the opportunity to review and request update or deletion, please email

          <H3 >f. Security</H3>
          <P>GeoRiot maintains reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards (E.g. general PII
            safeguard processes, account ownership verification for client support, Compliance with GDPR/CCPA data deletion
            requests), considering factors such as the currently available security technologies and the costs to implement those
            technologies to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
            destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
            With respect to electronically stored information, safeguards that GeoRiot maintain include, but are not limited to:
            (1) restricting access to servers and other infrastructure to only authorized individuals with VPN credentials; (2)
            regular installation of software security updates; (3) logging of system activities such as failed login attempts and
            suspicious behavior; and (4) retention of data for only the duration necessary for processing. Notwithstanding the
            safeguards maintained by GeoRiot. GeoRiot cannot guarantee that these safeguards will not be penetrated or
            compromised or that all information will remain secure under all circumstances.</P>
          <H3 >g. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</H3>
          <P>GeoRiot will take reasonable steps
            to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current,
            and reliable for its intended use, and to ensure that it does not
            process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with the
            purposes for which it was collected unless authorized by the
            individual. GeoRiot will take reasonable and appropriate measures to
            ensure that it does not retain Personal Information only for as long
            as is consistent with the purposes for which it was collected.</P>
          <H3 >h. Disclosures for Law Enforcement and National
            Security Purposes</H3>
          <P>GeoRiot may be required to disclose
            Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public
            authorities with appropriate jurisdiction, including to meet national

            discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. GeoRiot
            does not offer any rewards programs or incentives for the collection
            or sharing of data at this time.</P>


          <H2>13. Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability</H2>
          <p>GeoRiot is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") with respect to this
            Policy. The FTC may investigate violations of this Policy, and enforce compliance with the SCCs, EU Regulations, the
            UK Data Protection Laws and applicable law.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot provides assurance of its compliance with this Policy by conducting internal assessments of its relevant
            practices internally. In the event such an assessment finds non-compliant privacy, corrective action plans will be
            developed to resolve the identified gaps in compliance, as well as preventive action plans to maintain compliance.</p>
          <p>Any employee GeoRiot finds has violated this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
            termination of employment.</p>
          <p>Any complaints, questions or concerns about the use or disclosures of Potential Personal Information or Client
            Personal Data by GeoRiot or other matters subject to this Policy should be directed to the address given below.
            GeoRiot will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal
            information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy, and will respond to any complaint within
            thirty (30) days of receiving a complaint.</p>
          <p>In the event you are not satisfied with the response to a complaint you may seek independent review by arbitration.
            In such an event the dispute will be subject to arbitration by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the
            American Arbitration Association ("ICDR"), under the rules of the ICDR, at no cost to you.</p>
          <p>In the event you have filed a complaint and pursued arbitration for a violation of this Policy, the SCCs, EU
            Regulations or the UK Data Protection Laws by GeoRiot and are not satisfied with the result, you have the right to
            seek arbitration by a panel proficient with SCCs, EU Regulations and the UK Data Protection Laws. This panel may
            impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief to remedy the violation of the Principles with respect to
            your rights. You may seek such arbitration through your nation's Data Protection Authority ("DPA").</p>
          <p>GeoRiot will respond promptly and appropriately to inquiries about this Policy and compliance with the EU
            Regulations, UK Data Protection Laws and the SCCs from the FTC or the U.S. Department of Commerce, including inquiries
            from DPAs. </p>


          <H2 >14. Amendment of Policy</H2>
          <P>GeoRiot reserves the right to modify
            this Policy at any time without notice. If GeoRiot amends this
            Policy, notice of the amendment and the amended policy will be posted

            appropriate. Any amendment will be consistent with the requirements
            of the SCCs and applicable EU law. The terms of this Privacy Policy
            in effect at the time Personal Information is collected by GeoRiot

            amendment.</P>
