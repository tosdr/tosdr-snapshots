Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>12.1 Governing Law. </strong>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>12.2 Arbitration. </strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WEBSHARE. This Section 12.2 (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Webshare that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Webshare, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“<strong>Claim</strong>” or collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms. </p><p>If you are a new Webshare User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Webshare at [legal@webshare.io] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@webshare.io"><strong>legal@webshare.io</strong></a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Webshare has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><strong>www.adr.org</strong></a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and Webshare agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (A) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (B) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (C) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Webshare agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Webshare from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 12.3 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WEBSHARE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER WEBSHARE USERS. YOU AND WEBSHARE FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WEBSHARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. </p><p><strong>13.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>12.2 Arbitration. </strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WEBSHARE. This Section 12.2 (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Webshare that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Webshare, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“<strong>Claim</strong>” or collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms. </p><p>If you are a new Webshare User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Webshare at [legal@webshare.io] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@webshare.io"><strong>legal@webshare.io</strong></a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Webshare has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><strong>www.adr.org</strong></a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and Webshare agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (A) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (B) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (C) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Webshare agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Webshare from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 12.3 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WEBSHARE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER WEBSHARE USERS. YOU AND WEBSHARE FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WEBSHARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. </p><p><strong>13. General</strong></p><p><strong>13.1 Assignment. </strong>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Webshare without restriction.

Except as otherwise stated in Section 12.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>13.4 No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Webshare’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p><p><strong>13.5 Contact.</strong> Please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@webshare.io"><strong>legal@webshare.io</strong></a> with any questions regarding these Terms.<br/></p></div><div class="w-richtext"><p>Welcome to Webshare!

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>12.1 Governing Law. </strong>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>12.2 Arbitration. </strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WEBSHARE. This Section 12.2 (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Webshare that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Webshare, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“<strong>Claim</strong>” or collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms. </p><p>If you are a new Webshare User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Webshare at [legal@webshare.io] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@webshare.io"><strong>legal@webshare.io</strong></a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Webshare has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><strong>www.adr.org</strong></a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and Webshare agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (A) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (B) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (C) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Webshare agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Webshare from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 12.3 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WEBSHARE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER WEBSHARE USERS. YOU AND WEBSHARE FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WEBSHARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. </p><p><strong>13. General</strong></p><p><strong>13.1 Assignment. </strong>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Webshare without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p><p><strong>13.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.</strong> Webshare may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webshare in our sole discretion. Webshare reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. Webshare is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. </p><p>Webshare may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time. When we change these Terms, we will post the updated Terms on our website and notify you that changes have been made to these Terms. Any updated Terms shall be deemed accepted and become effective 30 days after such notification, unless you provide Webshare with a written rejection of the updated Terms, in which case, the Terms shall continue under its original provisions until the end of your ongoing Subscription Period and the updated Terms shall become effective at the start of your next Subscription Period or your purchase of any other Service, whichever is earlier. If you do not agree to these Terms or any updated Terms, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of the Terms or effective date of any updated Terms will confirm your consent and acceptance thereto. You also recognize and agree that Webshare’s <a href="https://www.webshare.io/privacy-policy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a> is not incorporated into these Terms and may be revised and updated by Webshare at any time in its sole discretion, with or without following the procedures of this Section 13.2.</p><p><strong>13.3 Entire Agreement/Severability. </strong>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Webshare in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Webshare concerning the Service. Except as otherwise stated in Section 12.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>13.4 No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Webshare’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p><p><strong>13.5 Contact.</strong> Please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@webshare.io"><strong>legal@webshare.io</strong></a> with any questions regarding these Terms.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/5e42f62100b3492c83c731fa_divider-sharp-bottom.svg" alt="" class="divider divider-bottom"/></div><div data-w-id="a5645c38-47bc-a1d9-74a1-d2e97a6bde93" class="bottom_footer-wrapper"><section class="full_cta-section"><div class="cta_third_planet_full" data-w-id="a5645c38-47bc-a1d9-74a1-d2e97a6bde95" data-animation-type="lottie" data-src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b7e846856eed9e41a35efe_third_planet.json" data-loop="1" data-direction="1" data-autoplay="1" data-is-ix2-target="0" data-renderer="svg" data-default-duration="6.166666666666667" data-duration="0"></div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b7ff9d90cc5798c8d4be75_stars.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="cta_stars_right_full"/><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b8000530843452c55ab426_stars_2.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="cta_stars_left_full"/><div class="cta_earht_green_full" data-w-id="a5645c38-47bc-a1d9-74a1-d2e97a6bde98" data-animation-type="lottie" data-src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b7e84616f5744348611660_green_planet.json" data-loop="1" data-direction="1" data-autoplay="1" data-is-ix2-target="0" data-renderer="svg" data-default-duration="6.166666666666667" data-duration="0"></div><div class="cta_earht_purple_full" data-w-id="a5645c38-47bc-a1d9-74a1-d2e97a6bde99" data-animation-type="lottie" data-src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b7e84660f97b46d63799e1_purple_planet.json" data-loop="1" data-direction="1" data-autoplay="1" data-is-ix2-target="0" data-renderer="svg" data-default-duration="6.166666666666667" data-duration="0"></div><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container_new w-container"><div class="full_cta-wrap"><div class="cta_cosmonaut_full" data-w-id="a5645c38-47bc-a1d9-74a1-d2e97a6bde9c" data-animation-type="lottie" data-src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e42f62100b3490abec730e4/64b7e5000f1746238795f5ec_cosmonaut.json" data-loop="1" data-direction="1" data-autoplay="1" data-is-ix2-target="0" data-renderer="svg" data-default-duration="6.166666666666667" data-duration="0"></div><div class="cta_title_wrap is-footer"><h1 class="cta_title">Get started today, </h1><h1 class="cta_title">no credit card required.</h1></div><div class="header-hp-button_wrap is-footer"><a href="https://proxy2.webshare.io/register/?source=footer-create-account" target="_blank" class="button_new is_hug w-inline-block"><div>Create Account</div><div class="pricing-card-button_icon w-embed"><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
