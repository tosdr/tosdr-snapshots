Your subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal 
period of the same duration as the subscription term originally 
selected, at the then current non-promotional subscription rate. Please 
note that you must terminate your subscription prior to the end of the 
subscription period for which you have paid to avoid being charged for 
the next subscription period. To change or terminate your subscription 
at any time, please choose one of the procedures detailed in the <a href="http://furrymate.com/dating/page/general/faq" title="" target="">FAQ</a>
section of the website or us the <a href="https://furrymate.com/dating/contactus/" title="" target="">contact us</a>

notice to the other.&nbsp;FurryMate reserves the right to suspend immediately
 or terminate your access to any of the Services, without notice, for 
any reason.&nbsp;FurryMate also reserves the right to remove your account 
information or data from the Site and any other records at any time at&nbsp;FurryMate's sole discretion. If your access to any of the Services is

<br/><br/>We operate an automatic renewal billing policy for all trial and 3 month plans.
<br/>This means that once your initial membership period has expired, for
 your convenience, your membership will automatically be renewed at the 
same rate that you signed up for using the original payment method. For 
example if you pay by card, we will continue to debit this same credit 
card as each subscription period expires. 
We will only debit these repeat payments when your current payment 
period expires and not before.<br/>
Please be aware when you subscribe to a trial period package, or 3 month
 package, you will become liable for automatic rebilling. THIS MEANS 
THAT THE MINIMUM DURATION OF YOUR CONTRACT WILL BE FOR THE INTIAL PERIOD
 YOU SELECT, AND THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR 
SERVICE. 
Please note that 6 month packages are one time payments and will not 
renew.<br/>
