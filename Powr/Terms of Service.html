Fees for Services.</b> <!-- -->You agree to pay to POWR any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.</p><p><b class="terms_paragraph_paragraph_content__YWO8X">1.2. Subscriptions.</b> <!-- -->Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by contacting our customer support team. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.</p><p><b class="terms_paragraph_paragraph_content__YWO8X">1.3. Taxes.</b> Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than POWR’s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”). You will pay POWR for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If POWR is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide POWR with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to POWR, you must provide POWR with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</p><p><b class="terms_paragraph_paragraph_content__YWO8X">1.4. Price Changes</b>. POWR may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. POWR will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.</p><p><b class="terms_paragraph_paragraph_content__YWO8X">1.5. Overage Fees</b>. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears on a monthly basis. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service.</p></main></section><section><header class="text-color7 font-gordita-bold"><h1 class="terms_paragraph_paragraph_header__GbZoR">2.
