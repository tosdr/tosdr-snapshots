      <h3 id="p1">Agreement to Terms</h3>
      <p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.</p>

      <h3 id="p2">Changes to Terms or Services</h3>
      <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

      <h3 id="p3">Who	May	Use	the	Services</h3>
      <h4><u>Eligibility</u></h4>
      <p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with BloomSky and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. You may allow others to use the Services on your behalf and under your supervision for non-commercial purposes (such as for educational purposes), but you remain responsible for ensuring all such users comply with these Terms.</p>
      <h4><u>Registration and	Your Information</u></h4>
      <p>If	you	want	to	use	certain	features	of	the	Services	you	will	have	to	create	an	account	(“<b>Account</b>”) by	entering
  an email	address and	selecting	a	password.	You	can	do	this	via	the	App	or through	your	account	with	certain
  third-party	social	networking	services	such	as	Facebook	(an	“<b>SNS	Account</b>”).	If	you	choose	the	SNS	Account
  option	we’ll	create	your	Account	by	extracting	from	your	SNS Account	certain	personal	information	such	as
  your	name	and	email	address	and	other	personal	information	that	your	privacy	settings	on	the	SNS	Account
  permit	us	to	access.</p>
      <p>It’s	important	that	you provide	us	with	accurate,	complete	and	up-to-date	information	for	your	Account and
  you	agree to	update	such	information, as	needed,	to	keep	it	accurate,	complete	and	up-to-date.	If	you	don’t,
  we	 might have	 to	 suspend	 or	 terminate	 your	 Account. You	 agree that	 you	 won’t disclose	 your	 Account
  password	 to	 anyone and	 you’ll notify	 us	 immediately	 of	 any	 unauthorized	 use	 of	 your	 Account. You’re
  responsible	for	all	activities	that	occur	under	your	Account,	whether	or	not	you	know	about them.</p>
      <h4><u>Using the Services</u></h4>
      <p>Via the Services, you will be able to: (i) have access to your own personal weather station, which will provide the following information: temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, UV light, rain detection and take pictures of the sky and the surrounding environment (collectively, the “<b>Weather Data</b>”), (ii) connect your Weather Station to the BloomSky network, (iii) if you choose to make your Weather Station publicly available on the BloomSky network, share your Weather Data with other App users and (iv) if you use the Widget, display the Weather Data on a website that you own or operate (“<b>Your Website</b>”). If you choose to make your Weather Station private, you will still have access to your own Weather Data but it will not be accessible to other App users.</p>

      <h3 id="p4">Feedback</h3>
      <p>We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“<b>Feedback</b>”). You can submit Feedback by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@bloomsky.com">support@bloomsky.com</a>. You grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license under any and all intellectual property rights that you own or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.</p>

      <h3 id="p5">Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy located at <a href="/legal/privacy">www.bloomsky.com/legal/privacy</a> for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.</p>

      <p>For purposes of these Terms: (i) "<b>Content</b>" means text, graphics, images, music, audio, video, communications, charts, data files, measures, photographs, messages, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Services; and (ii) “<b>User Content</b>” means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Services. Content includes without limitation User Content.</p>

      <h3 id="p7">Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal</h3>
      <p>BloomSky does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, BloomSky and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.</p>
      <h4><u>Rights in User Content Granted by You</u></h4>
      <p>By making any User Content available through the Services and connecting your Weather Station to a Wi-Fi network you hereby grant to BloomSky a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform and distribute your User Content in connection with operating and providing the Services and Content to you and to other Account holders and for any other purpose in BloomSky’s sole discretion.</p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by BloomSky on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
      <p>You can remove your User Content (other than User Content incorporated in the Weather Data) by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@bloomsky.com">support@bloomsky.com</a> and specifically asking us to delete it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content, including User Content incorporated in the Weather Data, may continue to exist on the Services. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.  We cannot remove User Content from your SNS Account once you have shared such Content with your friends.</p>
      <h4><u>Rights in Content Granted by BloomSky</u></h4>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, BloomSky grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download, view, copy, display and print the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes.</p>

      <h3 id="p8">Rights and Terms for App</h3>
      <h4><u>Rights in App Granted by BloomSky</u></h4>
      <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, BloomSky grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device that you own or control and to run such copy of the App for your own personal non-commercial purposes. You may not copy the App, except for making a reasonable number of copies for backup or archival purposes. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not: (i) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the App; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend or rent the App to any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App; or (iv) make the functionality of the App available to multiple users through any means.  BloomSky reserves all rights in and to the App not expressly granted to you under these Terms.</p>
      <h4><u>Additional Terms for App Store Apps</u></h4>
      <p>If you accessed or downloaded the App from the Apple Store, then you agree to use the App only: (i) on an Apple-branded product or device that runs iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system software); and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple Store Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>If you accessed or downloaded the App from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple Store, Google Play or the Amazon Appstore) (each, an “<b>App Provider</b>”), then you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>These Terms are concluded between you and BloomSky, and not with App Provider, and that, as between BloomSky and the App Provider, BloomSky, is solely responsible for the App.</li>
        <li>App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.</li>
        <li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify App Provider and App Provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of an App to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of BloomSky.</li>
        <li>App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</li>
        <li>In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, BloomSky will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.</li>

      <h3 id="p16">Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <h4><u>Governing Law</u></h4>
      <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
      <h4><u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u></h4>
      <p>You and BloomSky agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “<b>IP Protection Action</b>”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. <b>You acknowledge and agree that you and BloomSky are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</b>. Further, unless both you and BloomSky otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
      <h4><u>Arbitration Rules</u></h4>
      <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
      <h4><u>Arbitration Process</u></h4>
      <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
      <h4><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u></h4>
      <p>Unless you and BloomSky otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and BloomSky submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
      <h4><u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u></h4>
      <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. BloomSky will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
      <h4><u>Fees</u></h4>
      <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, BloomSky will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
      <h4><u>Changes</u></h4>
      <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if BloomSky changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:support@bloomsky.com">support@bloomsky.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of BloomSky’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and BloomSky in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
