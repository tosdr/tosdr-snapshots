<h3 id="heading-c-codecademy-accounts" class="styles_h3__VPpU9">C. Codecademy Accounts</h3>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">Your Codecademy account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Codecademy with a third-party service (for example, Facebook or Twitter), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Codecademy immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Codecademy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your “account settings” page.

<h3 id="heading-d-pro-accounts" class="styles_h3__VPpU9">D. Pro Accounts</h3>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">A job-readiness checker is available to our Pro users, allowing the instant generation of “job reports” with a predictive score on “how ready” a learner might be to apply to specific real job postings. The job reports are generated using proprietary data Codecademy has on a learner’s learning progress and optional user uploaded past professional experiences. This tool bridges the “last mile” gap between learner progress made through completing content on Codecademy and the potential success of applying to desired jobs. This is an AI-powered feature subject to our team’s policy on responsible use of AI. We may place daily limits per user caps on how many Job Reports a user may generate.</p>
<h3 id="heading-e-school-accounts" class="styles_h3__VPpU9">E. School Accounts</h3>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13. Because Codecademy provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the School’s curriculum, CODECADEMY RELIES ON SCHOOL TO OBTAIN AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CONSENT, IF NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Codecademy to collect information from students before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as Codecademy. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p>

<h3 id="heading-a-governing-law" class="styles_h3__VPpU9">A. Governing Law.</h3>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Codecademy, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal 
Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>
<h3 id="heading-b-arbitration" class="styles_h3__VPpU9">B. Arbitration.</h3>
<p class="styles_p__TNq46">READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CODECADEMY. In the unlikely event that Codecademy has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Codecademy claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless you and Codecademy agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Codecademy from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Codecademy’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND CODECADEMY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>

type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"markdownPage":{"__typename":"MarkdownPage","content":"# Terms of Service\n\nWelcome to Codecademy, the website and mobile service of Codecademy LLC (“Codecademy,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Codecademy Privacy Policy , whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).\n\nPLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n## 1. Use of Our Service\n\nCodecademy provides an online interactive platform for taking and creating coding classes.\n\n### A. Eligibility\nThis is a contract between you and Codecademy. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Codecademy Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You must be 16 years or older to use the Services. If you are less than 18 years of age and would like to register to use any part of the Services, please ask your parent or legal guardian to review and agree to these terms before you use any part of the Services, or ask them to complete the purchase or registration on your behalf.  Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a particular competition, promotion, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content accessible through the Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Codecademy.\n\n### B. Codecademy Service\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Codecademy reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Codecademy Content (as defined below). Codecademy may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.\n\n### C. Codecademy Accounts\nYour Codecademy account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Codecademy with a third-party service (for example, Facebook or Twitter), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.\n\nYou may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Codecademy immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Codecademy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.\n\nYou may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your “account settings” page. By providing Codecademy your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your “account settings” page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.\n\n### D. Pro Accounts\nA job-readiness checker is available to our Pro users, allowing the instant generation of “job reports” with a predictive score on “how ready” a learner might be to apply to specific real job postings. The job reports are generated using proprietary data Codecademy has on a learner’s learning progress and optional user uploaded past professional experiences. This tool bridges the “last mile” gap between learner progress made through completing content on Codecademy and the potential success of applying to desired jobs. This is an AI-powered feature subject to our team’s policy on responsible use of AI. We may place daily limits per user caps on how many Job Reports a user may generate.\n\n### E. School Accounts\nThe Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13. Because Codecademy provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the School’s curriculum, CODECADEMY RELIES ON SCHOOL TO OBTAIN AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CONSENT, IF NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Codecademy to collect information from students before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as Codecademy. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.\n\n### F. Service Rules\nYou agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Codecademy servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Codecademy grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from Codecademy.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.\n\nWe may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.\n\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other Codecademy Users.

Access to these features may be subject to age restrictions. We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. Codecademy has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.\n\nYou agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current or (ix) violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. Codecademy reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Codecademy believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.\n\nIn connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:\n\nYour User Content and Codecademy’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.\nCodecademy may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.\nTo the best of your knowledge, all your User Content you provide to us is truthful and accurate.You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.\nCodecademy takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Codecademy shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.\n\n## 3. User Content License Grant\n\nBy posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Codecademy a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Codecademy’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, display, reproduce and perform such User Content solely as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.\n\n## 4.

This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal \nArbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless you and Codecademy agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Codecademy from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Codecademy’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND CODECADEMY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.\n\n## General\n\n### A.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.\n\n### D. No Waiver.\nNo waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Codecademy’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n\n### E.

This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).\n\nPLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n## 1. Use of Our Service\n\nCodecademy provides an online interactive platform for taking and creating coding classes.\n\n### A. Eligibility\nThis is a contract between you and Codecademy. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Codecademy Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You must be 16 years or older to use the Services. If you are less than 18 years of age and would like to register to use any part of the Services, please ask your parent or legal guardian to review and agree to these terms before you use any part of the Services, or ask them to complete the purchase or registration on your behalf.  Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a particular competition, promotion, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content accessible through the Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Codecademy.\n\n### B. Codecademy Service\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Codecademy reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Codecademy Content (as defined below). Codecademy may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.\n\n### C. Codecademy Accounts\nYour Codecademy account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Codecademy with a third-party service (for example, Facebook or Twitter), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.\n\nYou may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Codecademy immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Codecademy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.\n\nYou may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your “account settings” page. By providing Codecademy your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your “account settings” page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.\n\n### D. Pro Accounts\nA job-readiness checker is available to our Pro users, allowing the instant generation of “job reports” with a predictive score on “how ready” a learner might be to apply to specific real job postings. The job reports are generated using proprietary data Codecademy has on a learner’s learning progress and optional user uploaded past professional experiences. This tool bridges the “last mile” gap between learner progress made through completing content on Codecademy and the potential success of applying to desired jobs. This is an AI-powered feature subject to our team’s policy on responsible use of AI. We may place daily limits per user caps on how many Job Reports a user may generate.\n\n### E. School Accounts\nThe Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13.

The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Codecademy from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Codecademy’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
