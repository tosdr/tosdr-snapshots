    <h2>Public Data Guidelines</h2>

    <p>Some Open Humans members generously make their data public under the
      <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative
        Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication</a> (v1.0 or later). The
      following usage guidelines are based on goodwill. These are not a legal
      contract, but we request you follow these guidelines when using data from
      our project.</p>

    <h4>Don't re-identify</h4>

    <p>If an individual has not intentionally shared their name/identity in
      their Open Humans profile, you should not make specific efforts to
      re-identify that individual from this data unless you meet the following
      guidelines:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You inform Open Humans of your plans to perform this work.</li>
      <li>An ethics review board (e.g. an institutional review board) reviews
        and approves your study as human subjects research (i.e. it is not
        considered exempt).</li>
      <li>We privately receive any reports you plan to publish at least two
        weeks prior to publication and have an opportunity to contact you and
        your ethics board with concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Acknowledge and cite where possible</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Please acknowledge and cite the researchers who created the datasets
        shared by participants.</li>
      <li>Do not misrepresent Open Humans data as something you generated
        yourself.
      </li>
      <li>Please include a reference to these guidelines in any re-distribution
        of our data.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Share knowledge</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Use standard identifiers where possible to assist others interested in
        finding work related to a sample or data set, and to enable participants
        to track research derived from their contributions.</li>
      <li>We encourage open access publication when possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Use at your own risk</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Our data is offered "as is", without warranty of any kind.</li>
      <li>Our database will change, as participants may choose to withdraw
        and/or remove data.</li>
      <li>Any use you make of the data must conform to all applicable laws and
        regulations in a given jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have suggestions for changes to these guidelines, please feel free
      to <a href="mailto:support@openhumans.org">contact us</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="naming">
    <h2>Naming Guidelines</h2>

    <p>Members of Open Humans must choose names and usernames that meet the
      following guidelines. These names are public and can uniquely identify
      their account.</p>

    <h4>Real names are allowed, but not required</h4>
    <p>You may use your real name as your name or username (or both). You are
      not required to reveal your real name, but remember that your account's
      data and information might still be highly identifiable.</p>

    <h4>No impersonation</h4>
    <p>You may not use a name that implies you are a specific, identifiable
      person, unless that is your real name. If you have the same name as a
      well-known person to whom you are unrelated and are using your real name
      then you should state clearly on your userpage that you are unrelated to
      the well-known person.</p>

    <h4>Not disruptive or offensive</h4>
    <p>Examples of disruptive or offensive names or usernames are names that
      contain or imply profanity or personal attacks.</p>

    <h4>Not promotional</h4>
    <p>Your name or username should not promote an organization or product.</p>

    <h4>Not otherwise misleading or confusing</h4>
    <p>Your name or username should not be otherwise misleading or confusing.
      For example, you may not have a username that leads people to believe the
      account has permissions it does not have (e.g. "administrator" or
      "moderator").</p>
    <p>We're also flattered by the enthusiasm demonstrated by usernames similar
      to our own organization (e.g. "OpenHuman1"), but we believe these could
      be misleading and are therefore not allowed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="activity">
    <h2>Activity Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Open Humans has the following practices that it expects connected studies
      and other activities to follow.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Data management</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Explain the data you'll receive</b></p>
        <p>
          Give a plain English list of the data your activity will access and
          store. Describe the potential sensitivity and identifiability of this
          data. Give these lists to your participants or users, and (if you
          are a study) to your IRB or equivalent ethics board.
        </p>
        <p>For example, instead of saying:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>
          "We will access and store your Hypothetical Diet Tracker App data."
        </i></p>
        <p>Say:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>
          "We will access and store the following data from Hypothetical Diet
          Tracker App: your ZIP code, food diary, and weight log data."
        </i></p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Explain what you will do with the data you'll receive</b></p>
        <p>
          Give a plain summary that explains what you will do with the data you
          will access. Describe the kind of study or activity you are running and
          why you would like to access the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example say:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
          <i>"We will use this data to explore whether there is a correlation
            between a person’s location and their diet/weight."</i>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Explain your data privacy and security</b></p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for how your activity manages data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give a plain English description of how you will manage the data.
          Explain whether that data is identified or potentially identifiable,
          its sensitivity, and other privacy and security issues that may be
          relevant. Share this with your participants or users, and (if you
          are a study) with your IRB or equivalent ethics board.
        </p>
        <p>For example:
          <br>
          <div style="margin-left:20px;"><i>
            "Raw data will be managed privately, accessed only by study staff
            and other authorized individuals. To further enhance privacy and
            security, this private data will not have your name associated with
            it, although it is possible someone could identify you from the data."
          </i></div>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Explain what happens with the data after a user leaves your activity</b></p>
        <p>
          Users can leave your activity on Open Humans at any time. Explain what
          you will do with their data after this happens. (For example: will you
          delete your copies of their data?)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Be aware of existing de-identification standards</b></p>
        <p>
          You should be aware of what types of data are considered
          "identifiable" when you're deciding which data to collect and how to
          manage it. Although you may have access to data without explicit
          personal identifiers, that data can still be highly identifiable or
          become identifiable if combined with other data elements. Explain how
          this could happen with the data you are requesting from the
          individual users.
        </p>
        <p>
          "De-identification" refers to processing personal data to make it very
          difficult or impossible to re-identify an individual. Open Humans does
          NOT de-identify data. The most well known standard for data
          de-identification is
          <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html">
          HIPAA's safe harbor guidelines</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Don't ask for more data than you need</b></p>
        <p>
          When you're requesting data and information, be considerate. Don't
          needlessly increase the identifiability and/or sensitivity of the
          data you'll be collecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, avoid unnecessary granularity that makes data more
          identifiable. If someone's year of birth is sufficient for your
          activity, don't ask for the month and day.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Share data with activity members</b></p>
        <p>
          Open Humans supports the philosophy of "equal access": when generating
          data about individuals, we should try to give them access to that data.
          For example, we would like to support a study that wished to give their
          participants access to resulting raw genome data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities can use our APIs to upload data for their activity members.
          Your data will be private in their account, where they will be able
          to manage it as an additional data source.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Organize data according to type</b></p>
        <p>
          If you have data types that are very different, consider sharing them as
          separate units (e.g. "sequencing data" and "survey data") to facilitate
          your participants' downstream management of that data.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Minimize the use of personal data</b></p>
        <p>
          It's trivial to identify a data set if someone's name or email is
          included. Avoid collecting or maintaining this information, if
          possible. When you do collect such information, try to minimize its
          use (e.g. don't include it in data analysis files).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Use HTTPS</b></p>
        <p>
          Use HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) to encrypt transmissions of data to and
          from your website. This is required to protect user information,
          tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data in transit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running your own website, your SSL should be audited for
          using weak encryption algorithms and support for perfect forward
          secrecy with a tool like
          <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">Qualys SSL Server Test</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Keep secrets secret</b></p>
        <p>
          Your activity will have secret keys, codes, and tokens, that
          are used to authenticate identity and encrypt interactions. These
          MUST be kept secret (e.g. as local files or environment variable).
          You should use encrypted communications to share these with other
          administrators.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a secret is accidentally leaked,
          <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/">e.g.
          in a code commit</a> (even if private!), make sure removal is complete
          (e.g. using git-filter-branch) but &ndash; more importantly &ndash;
          make sure this secret is invalidated and a new key or token is
          generated.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Monitor and limit admin access</b></p>
        <p>
          Have a policy for who has administrative access to servers and data.
          Revoke access when it is no longer needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Use standard software and services</b></p>
        <p>
          Security is hard to implement correctly, and standard web frameworks and
          packages exist that implement these for you (e.g. password hashing).
          Standard services, like platform cloud hosting, can also help by
          implementing and updating standard security tools (e.g. SSL).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Stay up to date</b></p>
        <p>
          Security practices constantly need updating. Be sure to update operating
          systems and software packages to stay up to date with the latest security
          updates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Hash passwords</b></p>
        <p>
          If you're using passwords for account management, there is no need to
          store them. Use well-established salt and cryptographic hash
          functions (e.g. bcrypt) to verify passwords without storing them, to
          minimize the damage a database breach could cause.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Backup your database</b></p>
        <p>
          Perform regular backups, and regularly test the data restoration process.
          It's easy to think you are performing backups correctly, until it's too
          late.
        </p>
      </li>
