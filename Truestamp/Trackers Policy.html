  Cookie Policy of Truestamp
</h2>


<p>
  This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.
</p>
<p>
  For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br />
  For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
</p>

<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>



  <p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br />
The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.<br />
In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>

    How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent on this Application
  </h3>

  <p>
      Whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting or updating their preferences via the relevant privacy choices panel available on this Application.
  </p>

    <p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p>

  <h4>How to control or delete Cookies and similar technologies via your device settings</h4>

  <p> Users may use their own browser settings to:
<ul>
  <li>See what Cookies or other similar technologies have been set on the device;</li>
  <li>Block Cookies or similar technologies;</li>
  <li>Clear Cookies or similar technologies from the browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>The browser settings, however, do not allow granular control of consent by category.</p>


  <p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>

</ul>
<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p>


    <h4>How to opt out of interest-based advertising</h4>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">YourOnlineChoices</a> (EU and UK), the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (US) and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"  href="https://www.aboutads.info/consumers/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> (US), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising/">DAAC</a> (Canada), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.ddai.info/optout">DDAI</a> (Japan) or other similar services. Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.
</p>
<p>
The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices">AppChoices</a> that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.
</p>

  <h4>Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</h4>
  <p>Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers. However, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.</p>
