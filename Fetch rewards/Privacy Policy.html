  <i>Friend information when you Refer a Friend or participate in Social</i>:
  When you refer a friend to join Fetch we provide you a link, some
  pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend.
  You send your friend the link, along with the pre-formatted text, and referral
  code on your own, and you do not share any of your friend's information with
  Fetch.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral
    code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that
    their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you
    know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their
    first receipt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be
    your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be
    added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
    of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we
        will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to
        the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we
        will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you
        will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the
        user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly
        connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
      </li>
      <li>

<h3>Geo-Location Services</h3>
<p>
  We may utilize location services on your mobile device to collect and use
  location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. We
  may obtain the physical location of your device by using satellite, cell phone
  tower, WiFi, or other technologies or signals. The physical location is used
  to provide you with a variety of services such as personalized content and/or
  advertising. We also use your physical location to inform you of nearby stores
  where you might be able to purchase promoted products to earn Rewards. We may
  communicate with you based on your location, and when we do so, we do that
  through our App's push notifications. We do not use your geo-location as a
  basis for sending you text or SMS messages. If you do not want to receive push
  notifications, you can disable that through your Fetch App Settings. We will
  collect precise real-time geolocation data only if you consent. Once you
  consent, you may opt out of using location services using your device's
  functionality to do so, but this may degrade the features and functionality
  that we can provide. Separate from precise geo-location options, our App
  [constantly or when the App is being utilized] approximates your device
  location when the App is being utilized solely for fraud detection purposes.
</p>
<h3>Information from Other Sources</h3>

  We may collect data that is publicly available such as information you have
  submitted in public forums, including social media platforms. We may also

  other information that can enhance our existing information about you. We use
  this information to provide you services and to improve the products and
  services we deliver to you, including to prevent fraud and/or to verify your
  identity.

  account(s) so that Fetch, as your agent, can retrieve purchase information
  from digital receipts in your digital consumer account or email. In processing
