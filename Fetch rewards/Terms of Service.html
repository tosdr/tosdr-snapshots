  "us") a Delaware corporation.
</p>
<p>
  Fetch may provide services including, but not limited to, the Fetch Rewards™

  <strong>1. Your Interaction with Our Participating Brands.</strong> The Fetch
  Rewards Program allows you to engage with our participating brands to acquire
  points and/or bonus points. By using our App, website, and/or participating in
  our Program, you are directing Fetch Rewards to share your personal
  information you provide us by registering and earning rewards with all our
  participating brands, regardless of your actual interaction with each. The
  value you receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends
  on the amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to
  obtain points. For a list of our participating brands, which we update from
  time to time, visit <a href="/brands">https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands</a>.
  In addition, by uploading receipts, participating in a Challenge or taking a
  Survey offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards to intentionally
  interact with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program.
  Our participating brands may engage with you, including by sending you emails,
  and use your personal information according to their respective privacy
  policies. You understand that Fetch does not control and is not responsible
  for such engagement or policies. If you are a California consumer and want to
  learn more about how Fetch Rewards shares your personal information when you
  intentionally interact with our participating brands, please review our

  participating brands, please stop using the Services and delete your account
  at any time.

  Section 1 above, or ii) if you either do not earn Points, or do not redeem any
  Points for a Reward, for a period of ninety (90) days. After sixty (60) days
  of inactivity, Fetch will provide you thirty (30) days notice by sending an
  email or text message to the email address or phone number provided in your
  Registration Data that your account will be considered inactive and your
  Points will expire. Prior to the effective date for account inactivation and
  Points expiration, you may prevent your account from becoming inactive and
  your Points from expiring by doing either of the following: i) logging in to
  your account and successfully earning Points; or ii) redeeming any of your
  Points for a Reward. While expired Points cannot be recovered, you may
  reactivate your inactive Fetch account by logging into your account and
  earning Points. If you reactivate your account, you agree to all the Terms as
  then-currently stated.
</p>
<p><strong>POINTS AND REWARDS</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>6. How to Earn Points.</strong> Fetch’s App allows you to participate
  in our Program to interact with our participating brands to earn points
  (“Points”) from them for purchasing qualifying brands, completing special
  offers (“Offers”), or by completing other activities including taking surveys,
  entering a referral code, or engaging in any other activity as described in
  our App or Program. Not all users will qualify to earn points from all
  participating brands; for experimentation, brand trial, audience targeting, or
  other reasons, users may not earn points for all brands. Offers may be removed
  from the App at any time at Fetch’s sole discretion. Only receipts that are
  scanned showing applicable purchases while the Offer remains in the App will
  qualify to receive Points. In order to earn points, any receipt you scan must
  contain a description of the product specific enough to confirm that the
  purchase was made. When you provide Fetch a receipt, by uploading, linking an
  account with receipt information, or other means made available by Fetch, you
  allow Fetch to process the information and identify the details printed on
  that receipt. If you purchased a product qualifying for Points or a valid
  Offer according to the terms of that Offer, you are eligible for those Points
  or that Offer, and the receipt clearly describes a qualifying product, we will
  provide you Points on behalf of the participating brand in accordance with the
  Offer. We may not be able to accept or process receipts from some retailers,
  and so, Points will not be available for submitting those receipts. We do not
  accept receipts and will not award Points for purchases for transactions that
  are older than 14 calendar days. Fetch may limit the number of receipts that
  can be processed by you in a period of time to a maximum quantity, as notified
  in the Services.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>7. Points May Be Redeemed for Rewards.</strong> When your Points
  balance reaches the Minimum Redemption Amount, ("Minimum Redemption Amount"
  shall mean the minimum value of Points required to redeem any Reward offered
  in the Services ("Reward"), which is subject to change at any time at the sole
  discretion of Fetch), you may redeem your Points. Points can only be used in
  exchange for Rewards and have no other use or value. There is no automatic
  redemption of Points. No interest is accrued on Points. Points may be redeemed
  for Rewards at the rate specified in the Services at the time of redemption.
  Fetch does not guarantee that any particular Reward or Offer will be available
  on any given product for any specific user at any moment in time. Furthermore,
  not all Rewards or Offers may be available to all users at all times, and
  different Rewards or Offers may be available only to certain users. Items for
  which Rewards are or will be available are subject to change without notice.
  Fetch reserves the right to change, remove, discontinue or otherwise alter the
  available Rewards or Offers at any time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>8. Redemption Process.</strong> When you make a request to redeem
  Points for a Reward, you must elect within the App the Reward, which could be
  a gift card or other product offered as a Reward, you want to receive in
  exchange for your Points. Once a redemption request is approved and the
  Redemption Item is authorized by us, your Points balance will be reduced by
  the number of Points designated to the Redemption Item selected by you. All
  Redemption Items are non-refundable, and may not be returned or cancelled
  unless specifically offered to cancel in-app. We are not responsible or liable
  for any loss or delay of any Redemption Item once you have redeemed your
  Points. If you have any questions or concerns with the redemption process, you
  may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fetch.com">support@fetch.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>9. No Cash Value; Points Cannot Be Transferred.</strong> Fetch Rewards
  users have no property rights in Points, and Points can only be used as
  described here. Points have no cash, monetary, or other value, and cannot be
  redeemed in whole or in part for cash. Your Points balance or any part of it
  is not transferable, cannot be divided as part of a settlement, legal
  proceeding or death, and cannot be combined with Points of any other member in
  the Program. Points may not be brokered, bartered, attached, pledged, gifted,
  or sold. Expired Points cannot be redeemed, and you must be an active member
  of the Program in order to redeem Points.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10. Receipt Scanning and Item Accuracy.</strong> Receipt scanning
  technology is not always accurate. If an item is improperly identified, either
  by product name, size, or price, please consult the appropriate in App process
  to resolve this inaccuracy. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact
  our support team. In the Services, the receipt correction processes may not be
  available for certain receipt types. In addition, you may have a limited
  period of time, as stated in the App, in which you are allowed to correct your
  receipt(s). You are responsible for reviewing your scanned receipt to confirm
  accuracy. Fetch or any other affiliated business, participating brands, and/or
  retailers are not responsible for any inaccuracies in this process, and
  resolution through the in-App process and through our support team is your
  sole remedy.
</p>
<p><strong>OUR DIGITAL RECEIPT PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>11. Digital Receipt Program Description and Terms.</strong> The
  Digital Receipt Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) is currently the
  only way to earn points for online purchases or with the use of digital
  receipts through our Services. In order to participate in the Digital Receipt
  Program, you must link your email account(s) or your digital consumer account,
  such as your Amazon account, where you receive your receipts, to the Fetch App
  through the in-app process. In so doing, you provide your log-in credentials
  for that consumer account or email account, and you agree that we act as your
  agent in accessing relevant receipts through those accounts and processing
  that receipt information through our Services for you. Accordingly, you
  authorize Fetch as your agent to access your email account or consumer
  account, which may include any stores or websites that sell products for which
  our participating brands award you Points. You represent and agree that in
  providing any email or consumer account log-in credentials to Fetch that you
  are an authorized user of that account and that you have the authority to
  provide Fetch access to that account as your agent. Any information processed
  from those emails or digital receipts will be used and handled the same as any
  information you would submit via a paper receipt as set forth in these Terms
  and our Privacy Policy. Fetch holds your security with the utmost importance
  and encrypts the information you provide regarding any third-party account.
</p>
<p><strong>REFERRAL PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>12. Referral Program Description and Terms.</strong> From time to
  time, and at Fetch's sole discretion, we may offer bonus Points, Points, or
  other rewards when a new user you choose to refer becomes a user of the Fetch
  Program (a "Referral Program"). Any such Referral Program shall be subject to
  the additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App. When you
  participate in a Referral Program, we provide you a link, some pre-formatted
  text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. It is within
  your sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the link, the
  pre-formatted text, and referral code. You acknowledge that you do not share
  any of your friend's information with Fetch in connection with a Referral
  Program, and Fetch itself does not directly send any referral codes to your
  friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents
  from an individual before referring that individual to us in a Referral
  Program and inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender or initiator
  of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to
  the Referral Program; (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any
  such messages or communications; and (c) that you may be receiving a referral
  bonus if the individual becomes a new user of Fetch. Current or Inactive
  former users of the Services cannot qualify as new users for purposes of a
  Referral Program, and any attempt to create referrals to non-existent
  individuals or to multiple accounts for the same individual will be void and
  are in violation of these terms. We reserve the right to void or take any
  other action we deem appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a
  referral code is shared in a social media post or from a social media account
  that contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise
  inappropriate content. Fetch may discontinue and/or revoke any Referral
  Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any time without
  notice. Fetch Rewards reserves the right to decline to award referral bonuses,
  rescind bonus Points credited, or take any other action related to a Referral
  Program.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>13. Refer a Friend. </strong>When you participate in our "refer a
  friend" program ("Refer a Friend"), we designate you as an "advocate" with
  respect to the friend that you refer If you refer a friend to sign up using
  the Refer a Friend referral code that you provided, we will provide you the
  Points associated with that particular Refer a Friend offer once your friend
  successfully scans their first receipt, and we will let your friend know that
  their advocate has received points for the referral. We will also let you know
  that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first
  receipt.
</p>
<p><strong>FETCH SOCIAL</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>14</strong>. In our App, Social is a community of Fetch members that
  you create through friend referrals and invites. If your friend enters your
  referral code during sign up or elsewhere in app, they will be automatically
  added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list
  of Fetch friends in Social. You can also invite someone to be a friend on
  Social who is already a Fetch member, in which case, that invitation would not
  constitute a referral of a new user. You can search for a friend on Fetch via
  name, phone number or email address. If we find a match, you can invite that
  current Fetch member to be a friend on Social by generating a push
  notification to that friend through our App. The current member can then
  choose whether to accept your invitation. If they accept, we will
  automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be
  added to that friend's list of Fetch friends. If you do not want to
  participate in Social, simply remove all friend connections.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>15.</strong> By participating in Social, you consent and agree that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We will share your name, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
    profile photo, Points earned, merchants/stores from which receipts were
    scanned, top brands for which Points were earned, the chosen Rewards for
    which Points were redeemed, Point-earning activities engaged in, the date on
    which each activity occurred, information about Social Offers in which you
    and your friends are participating, and other information, as disclosed to
    you from time to time (collectively, your "Fetch Social Activity
    Information") with all those with whom you are directly connected as friends
    on Social.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will post on each of your friends' Social feed and on the Social
    leaderboard consisting of all your friends, your Fetch Social Activity
    Information, including the top brands you scanned, which may provide your
    friends details about specific products you may have purchased. If you do
    not want your Fetch Social Activity displayed to your friends or on
    leaderboards, do not participate in Social.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends,
    limited information about Point-earning activities you've engaged in, and
    Fetch Points will be visible to all your friends' friends with whom you are
    not directly connected ("Friends of Friends"), along with other users with
    whom you're not connected, but the Friends of Friends and other users will
    not be able to view any other Fetch Social Activity Information. Friends of
    Friends, however, may invite you to directly connect as their friend by
    sending you a push notification as set forth above.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may, at any time, disconnect a friend or all friends through the Fetch
    App. Doing so will remove all your Fetch Social Activity Information from
    your friend's Social feed and leaderboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fetch Rewards is not responsible for your interactions with your friends on
    or as a result of your participation in Social. You have the sole discretion
    to invite or disconnect friends and to participate in Social.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may choose to sync your contacts; this allows Fetch Rewards to identify
    which of your contacts in your device's address book are also Fetch Rewards
    users. When you upload your contacts, Fetch Rewards will access the names,
    phone numbers, and email addresses in your address book. We don't store this
    information and process it only momentarily to enable us to connect you with
    your contacts who are also using Fetch Rewards.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>16.</strong> You have the ability to react to and comment on your
  friend's Fetch Social Activity Information. We are not responsible for any
  comments posted by you, any of your friends, or Friends of Friends. We may,
  although we have no obligation to, remove any comments or reactions that we
  deem in our sole discretion to be inappropriate or offensive. We may remove
  any content or comments at any time and without notice in our sole discretion
  in accordance with these Terms of Service or if we believe in our sole
  discretion that they violate these Terms of Service or any applicable law,
  regulation, or rights of third parties.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>17. Social Offers.</strong> From time to time, Fetch may offer you and
  your friends opportunities to earn Points when you and your friends redeem
  certain offers that you share or that are shared with the friends in your
  Social group ("Social Offers"). Friends with whom Social Offers are shared can
  view a specific friend's completion or response to a Social Offer. You and
  your friends can also send each other text, email, and/or other messages about
  certain Social Offers by using pre-formatted text we provide. It is within
  your and your friends' sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the
  pre-formatted text about the Social Offer. Fetch itself does not directly send
  any such communications to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all
  necessary permissions and consents from an individual before sending any text
  or email messages and inform the individual: (a) that Fetch is not the sender
  or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that
  individual relating to the Social Offer; and (b) that you are not acting as
  our agent in sending any such messages or communications.
</p>
<p><strong>GOODRX PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>18.</strong> GoodRx is a service provided and operated by GoodRx, Inc.
  that offers individuals certain discounts on prescription drugs. Fetch
  distributes GoodRx cards through our App, and you can decide whether you want
  to activate your Fetch assigned GoodRx card (the "GoodRx Card") by using it to
  claim a discount in connection with the purchase of a prescription drug at
  participating pharmacies (a "GoodRx Claim"). Fetch does not operate the GoodRx
  service. The GoodRx service is subject to GoodRx's Terms of Use
  <a
    href="https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005225563-Terms-of-Use?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_L6LBhBbEiwA4c46uvNBi1CIr7_G1dI_cGDXJ26km9HgQV7-ydzwD18csudTMXG93F4Z2hoCsFkQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"

</p>
<p>
  <strong>19.</strong> Fetch will provide you Points when you make your first
  GoodRx Claim and when you use your GoodRx Card to make subsequent GoodRx
  Claims. If GoodRx rejects or reverses any GoodRx Claim, Fetch will deduct any
  Points already provided in connection with that GoodRx Claim from your
  account. Fetch is not involved in any way in making any determinations in
  connection with a GoodRx Claim, including whether to accept or reject a claim
  or what discounts or benefits to offer. By using a Fetch assigned GoodRx Card
  to make a GoodRx Claim, you direct GoodRx to disclose your GoodRx Card Member
  ID and information relating to your transactions to Fetch so that Fetch can
  provide you Points. The Point value you receive in participating in our GoodRx
  Program is calculated by and depends on the amount and nature of your GoodRx
  Claims.

    >41. Withdrawing from Fetch Rewards; Cessation, Suspension, and
    Termination.</strong
  >
  You are free, at any time, to withdraw from our Program or to stop using the
  Services by contacting us at
  <a href="mailto:support@fetch.com">support@fetch.com</a>, or if you stop using
  the App for 90 days or more, your account will automatically become inactive,
  as set forth above. Fetch may also terminate (or suspend access to) your use
  of the Services or your account, for any reason in our sole discretion,
  including if you violate any of these Terms. Fetch has the sole discretion to
  determine whether you are in violation of these Terms. Account termination may
  result in destruction of any Content associated with your account. We will try
  to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account, but we
  may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the
  interest of someone's safety or security, otherwise harmful to the rights or
  property of Fetch, or for any other reason deemed reasonable by us. Fetch may
  also stop providing the Services at any time. If we cease providing the
  Services, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your
  Registration Data, and if practicable, we will provide you thirty (30) days
  notice to make a redemption request (subject to our Minimum Redemption Amount
  of existing gift card requirement described above). If you do not make a
  redemption request within such thirty (30) day period, your entire Points
  balance will expire. If you cancel or inactivate your account, any then
  currently existing Points will automatically expire upon cancellation or
  inactivation. It is your responsibility to make a redemption request (subject
  to our Minimum Redemption Amount of Points balance requirement described
  above) before cancellation or inactivation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>42. Assignment.</strong> You may not assign, delegate or transfer
  these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account,
  in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Fetch's prior written
  consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and
  obligations in our sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>43. Applicable Law and Venue.</strong> Subject to Section 44 below,
  these Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State
  of Wisconsin, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any
  dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be
  finally settled in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of
  Wisconsin, Dane County. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties
  consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts
  located in Wisconsin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>44. MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> You agree
  that all claims or disputes arising out of the Terms will be decided by an
  arbitrator through arbitration and not by a judge or jury ("Arbitration
  Agreement"). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration
  Act ("FAA") and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration
  will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration
  Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), which are available at
  www.adr.org. The arbitrator's fees and the costs will be shared equally by the
  parties, unless prohibited by law. Parties are responsible for their own
  attorneys' fees. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Madison,
  Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed. A court of competent jurisdiction will
  have the authority to enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision and award.
  The parties agree to bring any claim or dispute in arbitration on an
  individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action, and there will
  be no right or authority for any claim or dispute to be brought, heard or
  arbitrated as a class or collective action ("Class Action Waiver"). Regardless
  of anything herein and/or the applicable AAA Rules, the interpretation,
  applicability or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver and/or the
  arbitrability of a claim or dispute may only be determined by an arbitrator.
  The following claims are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (a) claims
  in small claims court; (b) claims to enforce or to prevent the actual or
  threatened violation of a party's intellectual property rights; (c) claims for
  temporary relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy; and (d) claims
  that are non-arbitrable per the applicable federal statute.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>45. INFORMAL RESOLUTION.</strong> In an attempt to find the quickest
  and most efficient resolution of our issues, you and we agree to first discuss
  any issue informally for at least 30 days, except as provided below. To do
  that, please send your full name, your email and/or mailing address, your
  concern, and your proposed solution by certified mail to us at:
</p>
<p>
  Fetch Rewards, LLC., Legal Department<br />1050 E. Washington Ave., 2nd
  Floor<br />Madison, WI 53703<br />Attn: Legal Department
</p>
<p>
  If we would like to discuss an issue with you, we will contact you using an
  email or mailing address we have on file for you. IF WE DO NOT REACH AN AGREED
  UPON SOLUTION AFTER OUR DISCUSSIONS FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS, YOU AND WE AGREE
  THAT ANY CLAIM THAT EITHER OF US MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE
  TERMS OR SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 44 ABOVE.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>46.</strong> LIMITED TIME TO BRING A CLAIM. YOU AND WE AGREE TO BEGIN
  ANY CLAIM AND/OR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE,
  THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>47.</strong> WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
  STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and
  Fetch are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by
  arbitration, except as specified in Section 44 above. There is no judge or
  jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>48. Taxes.</strong> You agree that you are solely responsible for all
  applicable federal, state, local or provincial withholding, taxes, and
  government fees or costs associated with Points or Rewards and any exchanges
  and distributions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>49. Survival.</strong> Provisions that, by their nature, should
  survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of
  example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you
  have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms
  regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms that relate to
  any disputes between you and Fetch.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>50. Severability.</strong> If any provision of the Terms is for any
  reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent
  jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Terms shall be unimpaired and
  shall remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>51. Miscellaneous.</strong> The failure of either you or us to
  exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any
  further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
  unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the
  minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full
  force and effect and enforceable. You and Fetch agree that these Terms are the
  complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and
  Fetch, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral
  agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject
  matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a
  writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). You
  agree that Fetch has not made, and you have not relied on, any representation
  by Fetch relating to the Rewards, the Services, or the Fetchrewards.com
  website, web applications, or mobile application other than those expressly
  set forth in these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment
  is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any
  kind to bind Fetch in any respect whatsoever. You and Fetch agree there are no
  third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>52. Changes to these Terms.</strong> Fetch may make changes to or
  update these Terms of Service for business, legal, or other reasons, and will
  indicate those changes by updating the Effective Date above. Fetch reserves
  the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in
  these Terms, or any policy or guideline relating to the Services (including,
  without limitation, the Privacy Policy at any time and in its sole discretion,
  including terminating the Program which may result in expiration of any Points
  accumulated. From time to time you should review the Terms of Service and any
  changes in policies, guidelines and documents incorporated in them to
  understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.
  The Terms are always available to you and will show the "Effective Date" at
  the top of the page to let you know when they were last changed. We offer our
  Services only in accordance with our Terms. If you do not agree to any Terms
  at any time, you must immediately stop using the Services and any balance of
  Points in your account will expire according to Section 5 under "Inactivity".
  If you have any questions about the Terms, please submit a request at
  account-inquiry@fetch.com. Unless otherwise specified, and subject to
  applicable law, any changes or modifications to our Terms will be effective
  immediately upon posting of the revisions through the Services that are
  changed or modified, and your continued use of the Services after such time
  will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.

Your Interaction with Our Participating Brands.\u003C/strong> The Fetch\n  Rewards Program allows you to engage with our participating brands to acquire\n  points and/or bonus points. By using our App, website, and/or participating in\n  our Program, you are directing Fetch Rewards to share your personal\n  information you provide us by registering and earning rewards with all our\n  participating brands, regardless of your actual interaction with each. The\n  value you receive in participating in our Program is calculated by and depends\n  on the amount and nature of your interaction with our participating brands to\n  obtain points. For a list of our participating brands, which we update from\n  time to time, visit \u003Ca href=\"/brands\">https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands\u003C/a>.\n  In addition, by uploading receipts, participating in a Challenge or taking a\n  Survey offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards to intentionally\n  interact with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program.\n  Our participating brands may engage with you, including by sending you emails,\n  and use your personal information according to their respective privacy\n  policies. You understand that Fetch does not control and is not responsible\n  for such engagement or policies. If you are a California consumer and want to\n  learn more about how Fetch Rewards shares your personal information when you\n  intentionally interact with our participating brands, please review our\n  \u003Ca href=\"/privacy-notice-for-california-consumers\"\n    >Fetch Rewards' Privacy Notice for California Consumers\u003C/a\n  >.

Registration; Registration Data.\u003C/strong> Subject to your continued\n  compliance with these Terms, you may register for one (1) account with Fetch.\n  If you have been previously suspended, removed, or otherwise deactivated from\n  using the Services, you may not create or register another account to use the\n  Services. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information\n  about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Services\n  (\"Registration Data\"); and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration\n  Data, and any other information you provide to Fetch Rewards, and to keep it\n  accurate, current and complete. We are not responsible for any loss you suffer\n  as a result of your not keeping your Registration Data current. You may also\n  upload a profile photo for your account. You grant Fetch a perpetual,\n  irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, and\n  sublicensable license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, create\n  derivative works from any photos or materials you provide or upload to us\n  through the App. You agree that any photo you upload as your profile photo:(i)\n  will be owned or licensed by you to be used as your profile photo or as\n  otherwise provide to us and that you have all rights allowing you to use the\n  photo accordingly; (ii) will not infringe the intellectual property rights of\n  others; and/or (iii) will not be offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic,\n  or otherwise inappropriate. Although we have no obligation to monitor or\n  screen any photos or materials you provide or upload to the App, we reserve\n  the right to remove any photos or materials we deem as inappropriate within\n  our sole discretion and without notice to you.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>4. Your Account Security.\u003C/strong> When you create and register your\n  account with us, you choose a user name and password and may choose another\n  device authentication method. You are responsible for maintaining the security\n  of your password and device and to supervise use of your account. You must\n  notify us immediately via the contact information provided below if you\n  suspect any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You will not share\n  or transfer your account or password with or to anyone. We assume that anyone\n  using the Services or transacting through your account is you.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>5. Inactivity of Your Account.\u003C/strong> Your account will be deemed\n  inactive and your Points will expire under the following circumstances: i) if\n  you at any time request to stop participating in the Program as set forth in\n  Section 1 above, or ii) if you either do not earn Points, or do not redeem any\n  Points for a Reward, for a period of ninety (90) days. After sixty (60) days\n  of inactivity, Fetch will provide you thirty (30) days notice by sending an\n  email or text message to the email address or phone number provided in your\n  Registration Data that your account will be considered inactive and your\n  Points will expire. Prior to the effective date for account inactivation and\n  Points expiration, you may prevent your account from becoming inactive and\n  your Points from expiring by doing either of the following: i) logging in to\n  your account and successfully earning Points; or ii) redeeming any of your\n  Points for a Reward. While expired Points cannot be recovered, you may\n  reactivate your inactive Fetch account by logging into your account and\n  earning Points. If you reactivate your account, you agree to all the Terms as\n  then-currently stated.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>POINTS AND REWARDS\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>6. How to Earn Points.\u003C/strong> Fetch’s App allows you to participate\n  in our Program to interact with our participating brands to earn points\n  (“Points”) from them for purchasing qualifying brands, completing special\n  offers (“Offers”), or by completing other activities including taking surveys,\n  entering a referral code, or engaging in any other activity as described in\n  our App or Program. Not all users will qualify to earn points from all\n  participating brands; for experimentation, brand trial, audience targeting, or\n  other reasons, users may not earn points for all brands. Offers may be removed\n  from the App at any time at Fetch’s sole discretion. Only receipts that are\n  scanned showing applicable purchases while the Offer remains in the App will\n  qualify to receive Points. In order to earn points, any receipt you scan must\n  contain a description of the product specific enough to confirm that the\n  purchase was made. When you provide Fetch a receipt, by uploading, linking an\n  account with receipt information, or other means made available by Fetch, you\n  allow Fetch to process the information and identify the details printed on\n  that receipt. If you purchased a product qualifying for Points or a valid\n  Offer according to the terms of that Offer, you are eligible for those Points\n  or that Offer, and the receipt clearly describes a qualifying product, we will\n  provide you Points on behalf of the participating brand in accordance with the\n  Offer. We may not be able to accept or process receipts from some retailers,\n  and so, Points will not be available for submitting those receipts. We do not\n  accept receipts and will not award Points for purchases for transactions that\n  are older than 14 calendar days. Fetch may limit the number of receipts that\n  can be processed by you in a period of time to a maximum quantity, as notified\n  in the Services.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>7. Points May Be Redeemed for Rewards.\u003C/strong> When your Points\n  balance reaches the Minimum Redemption Amount, (\"Minimum Redemption Amount\"\n  shall mean the minimum value of Points required to redeem any Reward offered\n  in the Services (\"Reward\"), which is subject to change at any time at the sole\n  discretion of Fetch), you may redeem your Points. Points can only be used in\n  exchange for Rewards and have no other use or value. There is no automatic\n  redemption of Points. No interest is accrued on Points. Points may be redeemed\n  for Rewards at the rate specified in the Services at the time of redemption.\n  Fetch does not guarantee that any particular Reward or Offer will be available\n  on any given product for any specific user at any moment in time. Furthermore,\n  not all Rewards or Offers may be available to all users at all times, and\n  different Rewards or Offers may be available only to certain users. Items for\n  which Rewards are or will be available are subject to change without notice.\n  Fetch reserves the right to change, remove, discontinue or otherwise alter the\n  available Rewards or Offers at any time.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>8. Redemption Process.\u003C/strong> When you make a request to redeem\n  Points for a Reward, you must elect within the App the Reward, which could be\n  a gift card or other product offered as a Reward, you want to receive in\n  exchange for your Points. Once a redemption request is approved and the\n  Redemption Item is authorized by us, your Points balance will be reduced by\n  the number of Points designated to the Redemption Item selected by you. All\n  Redemption Items are non-refundable, and may not be returned or cancelled\n  unless specifically offered to cancel in-app. We are not responsible or liable\n  for any loss or delay of any Redemption Item once you have redeemed your\n  Points. If you have any questions or concerns with the redemption process, you\n  may contact us at \u003Ca href=\"mailto:support@fetch.com\">support@fetch.com\u003C/a>.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>9. No Cash Value; Points Cannot Be Transferred.\u003C/strong> Fetch Rewards\n  users have no property rights in Points, and Points can only be used as\n  described here. Points have no cash, monetary, or other value, and cannot be\n  redeemed in whole or in part for cash. Your Points balance or any part of it\n  is not transferable, cannot be divided as part of a settlement, legal\n  proceeding or death, and cannot be combined with Points of any other member in\n  the Program. Points may not be brokered, bartered, attached, pledged, gifted,\n  or sold. Expired Points cannot be redeemed, and you must be an active member\n  of the Program in order to redeem Points.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>10. Receipt Scanning and Item Accuracy.\u003C/strong> Receipt scanning\n  technology is not always accurate. If an item is improperly identified, either\n  by product name, size, or price, please consult the appropriate in App process\n  to resolve this inaccuracy. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact\n  our support team. In the Services, the receipt correction processes may not be\n  available for certain receipt types. In addition, you may have a limited\n  period of time, as stated in the App, in which you are allowed to correct your\n  receipt(s). You are responsible for reviewing your scanned receipt to confirm\n  accuracy.

Digital Receipt Program Description and Terms.\u003C/strong> The\n  Digital Receipt Program (Titled \"eReceipts\" in the Services) is currently the\n  only way to earn points for online purchases or with the use of digital\n  receipts through our Services. In order to participate in the Digital Receipt\n  Program, you must link your email account(s) or your digital consumer account,\n  such as your Amazon account, where you receive your receipts, to the Fetch App\n  through the in-app process. In so doing, you provide your log-in credentials\n  for that consumer account or email account, and you agree that we act as your\n  agent in accessing relevant receipts through those accounts and processing\n  that receipt information through our Services for you. Accordingly, you\n  authorize Fetch as your agent to access your email account or consumer\n  account, which may include any stores or websites that sell products for which\n  our participating brands award you Points. You represent and agree that in\n  providing any email or consumer account log-in credentials to Fetch that you\n  are an authorized user of that account and that you have the authority to\n  provide Fetch access to that account as your agent. Any information processed\n  from those emails or digital receipts will be used and handled the same as any\n  information you would submit via a paper receipt as set forth in these Terms\n  and our Privacy Policy. Fetch holds your security with the utmost importance\n  and encrypts the information you provide regarding any third-party account.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>REFERRAL PROGRAM\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>12. Referral Program Description and Terms.\u003C/strong> From time to\n  time, and at Fetch's sole discretion, we may offer bonus Points, Points, or\n  other rewards when a new user you choose to refer becomes a user of the Fetch\n  Program (a \"Referral Program\"). Any such Referral Program shall be subject to\n  the additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App. When you\n  participate in a Referral Program, we provide you a link, some pre-formatted\n  text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. It is within\n  your sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the link, the\n  pre-formatted text, and referral code. You acknowledge that you do not share\n  any of your friend's information with Fetch in connection with a Referral\n  Program, and Fetch itself does not directly send any referral codes to your\n  friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents\n  from an individual before referring that individual to us in a Referral\n  Program and inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender or initiator\n  of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to\n  the Referral Program; (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any\n  such messages or communications; and (c) that you may be receiving a referral\n  bonus if the individual becomes a new user of Fetch. Current or Inactive\n  former users of the Services cannot qualify as new users for purposes of a\n  Referral Program, and any attempt to create referrals to non-existent\n  individuals or to multiple accounts for the same individual will be void and\n  are in violation of these terms. We reserve the right to void or take any\n  other action we deem appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a\n  referral code is shared in a social media post or from a social media account\n  that contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise\n  inappropriate content. Fetch may discontinue and/or revoke any Referral\n  Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any time without\n  notice. Fetch Rewards reserves the right to decline to award referral bonuses,\n  rescind bonus Points credited, or take any other action related to a Referral\n  Program.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>13. Refer a Friend. \u003C/strong>When you participate in our \"refer a\n  friend\" program (\"Refer a Friend\"), we designate you as an \"advocate\" with\n  respect to the friend that you refer If you refer a friend to sign up using\n  the Refer a Friend referral code that you provided, we will provide you the\n  Points associated with that particular Refer a Friend offer once your friend\n  successfully scans their first receipt, and we will let your friend know that\n  their advocate has received points for the referral. We will also let you know\n  that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first\n  receipt.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>FETCH SOCIAL\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>14\u003C/strong>. In our App, Social is a community of Fetch members that\n  you create through friend referrals and invites. If your friend enters your\n  referral code during sign up or elsewhere in app, they will be automatically\n  added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list\n  of Fetch friends in Social. You can also invite someone to be a friend on\n  Social who is already a Fetch member, in which case, that invitation would not\n  constitute a referral of a new user. You can search for a friend on Fetch via\n  name, phone number or email address. If we find a match, you can invite that\n  current Fetch member to be a friend on Social by generating a push\n  notification to that friend through our App. The current member can then\n  choose whether to accept your invitation. If they accept, we will\n  automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be\n  added to that friend's list of Fetch friends. If you do not want to\n  participate in Social, simply remove all friend connections.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>15.\u003C/strong> By participating in Social, you consent and agree that:\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n  \u003Cli>\n    We will share your name, state, number of friends and mutual friends,\n    profile photo, Points earned, merchants/stores from which receipts were\n    scanned, top brands for which Points were earned, the chosen Rewards for\n    which Points were redeemed, Point-earning activities engaged in, the date on\n    which each activity occurred, information about Social Offers in which you\n    and your friends are participating, and other information, as disclosed to\n    you from time to time (collectively, your \"Fetch Social Activity\n    Information\") with all those with whom you are directly connected as friends\n    on Social.\n  \u003C/li>\n  \u003Cli>\n    We will post on each of your friends' Social feed and on the Social\n    leaderboard consisting of all your friends, your Fetch Social Activity\n    Information, including the top brands you scanned, which may provide your\n    friends details about specific products you may have purchased.

Friends of\n    Friends, however, may invite you to directly connect as their friend by\n    sending you a push notification as set forth above.\n  \u003C/li>\n  \u003Cli>\n    You may, at any time, disconnect a friend or all friends through the Fetch\n    App. Doing so will remove all your Fetch Social Activity Information from\n    your friend's Social feed and leaderboard.\n  \u003C/li>\n  \u003Cli>\n    Fetch Rewards is not responsible for your interactions with your friends on\n    or as a result of your participation in Social.

Social Offers.\u003C/strong> From time to time, Fetch may offer you and\n  your friends opportunities to earn Points when you and your friends redeem\n  certain offers that you share or that are shared with the friends in your\n  Social group (\"Social Offers\"). Friends with whom Social Offers are shared can\n  view a specific friend's completion or response to a Social Offer. You and\n  your friends can also send each other text, email, and/or other messages about\n  certain Social Offers by using pre-formatted text we provide. It is within\n  your and your friends' sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the\n  pre-formatted text about the Social Offer. Fetch itself does not directly send\n  any such communications to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all\n  necessary permissions and consents from an individual before sending any text\n  or email messages and inform the individual: (a) that Fetch is not the sender\n  or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that\n  individual relating to the Social Offer; and (b) that you are not acting as\n  our agent in sending any such messages or communications.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>GOODRX PROGRAM\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>18.\u003C/strong> GoodRx is a service provided and operated by GoodRx, Inc.\n  that offers individuals certain discounts on prescription drugs.

Fetch is not involved in any way in making any determinations in\n  connection with a GoodRx Claim, including whether to accept or reject a claim\n  or what discounts or benefits to offer. By using a Fetch assigned GoodRx Card\n  to make a GoodRx Claim, you direct GoodRx to disclose your GoodRx Card Member\n  ID and information relating to your transactions to Fetch so that Fetch can\n  provide you Points. The Point value you receive in participating in our GoodRx\n  Program is calculated by and depends on the amount and nature of your GoodRx\n  Claims.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>SMS TERMS OF SERVICE\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fetch Rewards Alerts\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>20.\u003C/strong> You agree that Fetch Rewards may send transactional text\n  and/or SMS messages, including important account notices, such as point\n  expiration warnings and account security notices to the phone number you used\n  to register your account or any phone number you provide to us in updating\n  that information.

Fetch may also terminate (or suspend access to) your use\n  of the Services or your account, for any reason in our sole discretion,\n  including if you violate any of these Terms. Fetch has the sole discretion to\n  determine whether you are in violation of these Terms. Account termination may\n  result in destruction of any Content associated with your account. We will try\n  to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account, but we\n  may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the\n  interest of someone's safety or security, otherwise harmful to the rights or\n  property of Fetch, or for any other reason deemed reasonable by us. Fetch may\n  also stop providing the Services at any time. If we cease providing the\n  Services, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your\n  Registration Data, and if practicable, we will provide you thirty (30) days\n  notice to make a redemption request (subject to our Minimum Redemption Amount\n  of existing gift card requirement described above). If you do not make a\n  redemption request within such thirty (30) day period, your entire Points\n  balance will expire.

Applicable Law and Venue.\u003C/strong> Subject to Section 44 below,\n  these Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State\n  of Wisconsin, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any\n  dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be\n  finally settled in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of\n  Wisconsin, Dane County. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties\n  consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts\n  located in Wisconsin.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>44. MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\u003C/strong> You agree\n  that all claims or disputes arising out of the Terms will be decided by an\n  arbitrator through arbitration and not by a judge or jury (\"Arbitration\n  Agreement\"). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration\n  Act (\"FAA\") and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration\n  will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration\n  Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), which are available at\n  www.adr.org. The arbitrator's fees and the costs will be shared equally by the\n  parties, unless prohibited by law. Parties are responsible for their own\n  attorneys' fees. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Madison,\n  Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed. A court of competent jurisdiction will\n  have the authority to enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision and award.\n  The parties agree to bring any claim or dispute in arbitration on an\n  individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action, and there will\n  be no right or authority for any claim or dispute to be brought, heard or\n  arbitrated as a class or collective action (\"Class Action Waiver\"). Regardless\n  of anything herein and/or the applicable AAA Rules, the interpretation,\n  applicability or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver and/or the\n  arbitrability of a claim or dispute may only be determined by an arbitrator.\n  The following claims are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (a) claims\n  in small claims court; (b) claims to enforce or to prevent the actual or\n  threatened violation of a party's intellectual property rights; (c) claims for\n  temporary relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy; and (d) claims\n  that are non-arbitrable per the applicable federal statute.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>45. INFORMAL RESOLUTION.\u003C/strong> In an attempt to find the quickest\n  and most efficient resolution of our issues, you and we agree to first discuss\n  any issue informally for at least 30 days, except as provided below.

YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND\n  STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and\n  Fetch are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by\n  arbitration, except as specified in Section 44 above. There is no judge or\n  jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>48. Taxes.\u003C/strong> You agree that you are solely responsible for all\n  applicable federal, state, local or provincial withholding, taxes, and\n  government fees or costs associated with Points or Rewards and any exchanges\n  and distributions.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>49. Survival.\u003C/strong> Provisions that, by their nature, should\n  survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of\n  example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you\n  have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms\n  regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms that relate to\n  any disputes between you and Fetch.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>50. Severability.\u003C/strong> If any provision of the Terms is for any\n  reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent\n  jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Terms shall be unimpaired and\n  shall remain in full force and effect.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>51. Miscellaneous.\u003C/strong> The failure of either you or us to\n  exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any\n  further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be\n  unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the\n  minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full\n  force and effect and enforceable. You and Fetch agree that these Terms are the\n  complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and\n  Fetch, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral\n  agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject\n  matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a\n  writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). You\n  agree that Fetch has not made, and you have not relied on, any representation\n  by Fetch relating to the Rewards, the Services, or the Fetchrewards.com\n  website, web applications, or mobile application other than those expressly\n  set forth in these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment\n  is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any\n  kind to bind Fetch in any respect whatsoever.

How to Earn Points.\u003C/strong> Fetch’s App allows you to participate\n  in our Program to interact with our participating brands to earn points\n  (“Points”) from them for purchasing qualifying brands, completing special\n  offers (“Offers”), or by completing other activities including taking surveys,\n  entering a referral code, or engaging in any other activity as described in\n  our App or Program. Not all users will qualify to earn points from all\n  participating brands; for experimentation, brand trial, audience targeting, or\n  other reasons, users may not earn points for all brands. Offers may be removed\n  from the App at any time at Fetch’s sole discretion. Only receipts that are\n  scanned showing applicable purchases while the Offer remains in the App will\n  qualify to receive Points. In order to earn points, any receipt you scan must\n  contain a description of the product specific enough to confirm that the\n  purchase was made. When you provide Fetch a receipt, by uploading, linking an\n  account with receipt information, or other means made available by Fetch, you\n  allow Fetch to process the information and identify the details printed on\n  that receipt. If you purchased a product qualifying for Points or a valid\n  Offer according to the terms of that Offer, you are eligible for those Points\n  or that Offer, and the receipt clearly describes a qualifying product, we will\n  provide you Points on behalf of the participating brand in accordance with the\n  Offer. We may not be able to accept or process receipts from some retailers,\n  and so, Points will not be available for submitting those receipts. We do not\n  accept receipts and will not award Points for purchases for transactions that\n  are older than 14 calendar days. Fetch may limit the number of receipts that\n  can be processed by you in a period of time to a maximum quantity, as notified\n  in the Services.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>7. Points May Be Redeemed for Rewards.\u003C/strong> When your Points\n  balance reaches the Minimum Redemption Amount, (\"Minimum Redemption Amount\"\n  shall mean the minimum value of Points required to redeem any Reward offered\n  in the Services (\"Reward\"), which is subject to change at any time at the sole\n  discretion of Fetch), you may redeem your Points. Points can only be used in\n  exchange for Rewards and have no other use or value. There is no automatic\n  redemption of Points. No interest is accrued on Points. Points may be redeemed\n  for Rewards at the rate specified in the Services at the time of redemption.\n  Fetch does not guarantee that any particular Reward or Offer will be available\n  on any given product for any specific user at any moment in time. Furthermore,\n  not all Rewards or Offers may be available to all users at all times, and\n  different Rewards or Offers may be available only to certain users. Items for\n  which Rewards are or will be available are subject to change without notice.\n  Fetch reserves the right to change, remove, discontinue or otherwise alter the\n  available Rewards or Offers at any time.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>8. Redemption Process.\u003C/strong> When you make a request to redeem\n  Points for a Reward, you must elect within the App the Reward, which could be\n  a gift card or other product offered as a Reward, you want to receive in\n  exchange for your Points. Once a redemption request is approved and the\n  Redemption Item is authorized by us, your Points balance will be reduced by\n  the number of Points designated to the Redemption Item selected by you. All\n  Redemption Items are non-refundable, and may not be returned or cancelled\n  unless specifically offered to cancel in-app. We are not responsible or liable\n  for any loss or delay of any Redemption Item once you have redeemed your\n  Points. If you have any questions or concerns with the redemption process, you\n  may contact us at \u003Ca href=\"mailto:support@fetch.com\">support@fetch.com\u003C/a>.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>9. No Cash Value; Points Cannot Be Transferred.\u003C/strong> Fetch Rewards\n  users have no property rights in Points, and Points can only be used as\n  described here. Points have no cash, monetary, or other value, and cannot be\n  redeemed in whole or in part for cash. Your Points balance or any part of it\n  is not transferable, cannot be divided as part of a settlement, legal\n  proceeding or death, and cannot be combined with Points of any other member in\n  the Program. Points may not be brokered, bartered, attached, pledged, gifted,\n  or sold. Expired Points cannot be redeemed, and you must be an active member\n  of the Program in order to redeem Points.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>10. Receipt Scanning and Item Accuracy.\u003C/strong> Receipt scanning\n  technology is not always accurate. If an item is improperly identified, either\n  by product name, size, or price, please consult the appropriate in App process\n  to resolve this inaccuracy. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact\n  our support team. In the Services, the receipt correction processes may not be\n  available for certain receipt types. In addition, you may have a limited\n  period of time, as stated in the App, in which you are allowed to correct your\n  receipt(s). You are responsible for reviewing your scanned receipt to confirm\n  accuracy.

Digital Receipt Program Description and Terms.\u003C/strong> The\n  Digital Receipt Program (Titled \"eReceipts\" in the Services) is currently the\n  only way to earn points for online purchases or with the use of digital\n  receipts through our Services. In order to participate in the Digital Receipt\n  Program, you must link your email account(s) or your digital consumer account,\n  such as your Amazon account, where you receive your receipts, to the Fetch App\n  through the in-app process. In so doing, you provide your log-in credentials\n  for that consumer account or email account, and you agree that we act as your\n  agent in accessing relevant receipts through those accounts and processing\n  that receipt information through our Services for you. Accordingly, you\n  authorize Fetch as your agent to access your email account or consumer\n  account, which may include any stores or websites that sell products for which\n  our participating brands award you Points. You represent and agree that in\n  providing any email or consumer account log-in credentials to Fetch that you\n  are an authorized user of that account and that you have the authority to\n  provide Fetch access to that account as your agent. Any information processed\n  from those emails or digital receipts will be used and handled the same as any\n  information you would submit via a paper receipt as set forth in these Terms\n  and our Privacy Policy. Fetch holds your security with the utmost importance\n  and encrypts the information you provide regarding any third-party account.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>REFERRAL PROGRAM\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>12. Referral Program Description and Terms.\u003C/strong> From time to\n  time, and at Fetch's sole discretion, we may offer bonus Points, Points, or\n  other rewards when a new user you choose to refer becomes a user of the Fetch\n  Program (a \"Referral Program\"). Any such Referral Program shall be subject to\n  the additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App. When you\n  participate in a Referral Program, we provide you a link, some pre-formatted\n  text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. It is within\n  your sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the link, the\n  pre-formatted text, and referral code. You acknowledge that you do not share\n  any of your friend's information with Fetch in connection with a Referral\n  Program, and Fetch itself does not directly send any referral codes to your\n  friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents\n  from an individual before referring that individual to us in a Referral\n  Program and inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender or initiator\n  of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to\n  the Referral Program; (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any\n  such messages or communications; and (c) that you may be receiving a referral\n  bonus if the individual becomes a new user of Fetch. Current or Inactive\n  former users of the Services cannot qualify as new users for purposes of a\n  Referral Program, and any attempt to create referrals to non-existent\n  individuals or to multiple accounts for the same individual will be void and\n  are in violation of these terms. We reserve the right to void or take any\n  other action we deem appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a\n  referral code is shared in a social media post or from a social media account\n  that contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise\n  inappropriate content. Fetch may discontinue and/or revoke any Referral\n  Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any time without\n  notice. Fetch Rewards reserves the right to decline to award referral bonuses,\n  rescind bonus Points credited, or take any other action related to a Referral\n  Program.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>13. Refer a Friend. \u003C/strong>When you participate in our \"refer a\n  friend\" program (\"Refer a Friend\"), we designate you as an \"advocate\" with\n  respect to the friend that you refer If you refer a friend to sign up using\n  the Refer a Friend referral code that you provided, we will provide you the\n  Points associated with that particular Refer a Friend offer once your friend\n  successfully scans their first receipt, and we will let your friend know that\n  their advocate has received points for the referral. We will also let you know\n  that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first\n  receipt.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>FETCH SOCIAL\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>14\u003C/strong>. In our App, Social is a community of Fetch members that\n  you create through friend referrals and invites. If your friend enters your\n  referral code during sign up or elsewhere in app, they will be automatically\n  added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list\n  of Fetch friends in Social. You can also invite someone to be a friend on\n  Social who is already a Fetch member, in which case, that invitation would not\n  constitute a referral of a new user. You can search for a friend on Fetch via\n  name, phone number or email address. If we find a match, you can invite that\n  current Fetch member to be a friend on Social by generating a push\n  notification to that friend through our App. The current member can then\n  choose whether to accept your invitation. If they accept, we will\n  automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be\n  added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.

Social Offers.\u003C/strong> From time to time, Fetch may offer you and\n  your friends opportunities to earn Points when you and your friends redeem\n  certain offers that you share or that are shared with the friends in your\n  Social group (\"Social Offers\"). Friends with whom Social Offers are shared can\n  view a specific friend's completion or response to a Social Offer. You and\n  your friends can also send each other text, email, and/or other messages about\n  certain Social Offers by using pre-formatted text we provide. It is within\n  your and your friends' sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the\n  pre-formatted text about the Social Offer. Fetch itself does not directly send\n  any such communications to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all\n  necessary permissions and consents from an individual before sending any text\n  or email messages and inform the individual: (a) that Fetch is not the sender\n  or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that\n  individual relating to the Social Offer; and (b) that you are not acting as\n  our agent in sending any such messages or communications.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>GOODRX PROGRAM\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>18.\u003C/strong> GoodRx is a service provided and operated by GoodRx, Inc.\n  that offers individuals certain discounts on prescription drugs.

Fetch is not involved in any way in making any determinations in\n  connection with a GoodRx Claim, including whether to accept or reject a claim\n  or what discounts or benefits to offer. By using a Fetch assigned GoodRx Card\n  to make a GoodRx Claim, you direct GoodRx to disclose your GoodRx Card Member\n  ID and information relating to your transactions to Fetch so that Fetch can\n  provide you Points.

Fetch may also terminate (or suspend access to) your use\n  of the Services or your account, for any reason in our sole discretion,\n  including if you violate any of these Terms. Fetch has the sole discretion to\n  determine whether you are in violation of these Terms. Account termination may\n  result in destruction of any Content associated with your account. We will try\n  to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account, but we\n  may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the\n  interest of someone's safety or security, otherwise harmful to the rights or\n  property of Fetch, or for any other reason deemed reasonable by us. Fetch may\n  also stop providing the Services at any time. If we cease providing the\n  Services, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your\n  Registration Data, and if practicable, we will provide you thirty (30) days\n  notice to make a redemption request (subject to our Minimum Redemption Amount\n  of existing gift card requirement described above). If you do not make a\n  redemption request within such thirty (30) day period, your entire Points\n  balance will expire. If you cancel or inactivate your account, any then\n  currently existing Points will automatically expire upon cancellation or\n  inactivation.

Applicable Law and Venue.\u003C/strong> Subject to Section 44 below,\n  these Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State\n  of Wisconsin, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any\n  dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be\n  finally settled in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of\n  Wisconsin, Dane County. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties\n  consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts\n  located in Wisconsin.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>44. MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\u003C/strong> You agree\n  that all claims or disputes arising out of the Terms will be decided by an\n  arbitrator through arbitration and not by a judge or jury (\"Arbitration\n  Agreement\"). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration\n  Act (\"FAA\") and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration\n  will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration\n  Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), which are available at\n  www.adr.org. The arbitrator's fees and the costs will be shared equally by the\n  parties, unless prohibited by law. Parties are responsible for their own\n  attorneys' fees. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Madison,\n  Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed. A court of competent jurisdiction will\n  have the authority to enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision and award.\n  The parties agree to bring any claim or dispute in arbitration on an\n  individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action, and there will\n  be no right or authority for any claim or dispute to be brought, heard or\n  arbitrated as a class or collective action (\"Class Action Waiver\"). Regardless\n  of anything herein and/or the applicable AAA Rules, the interpretation,\n  applicability or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver and/or the\n  arbitrability of a claim or dispute may only be determined by an arbitrator.\n  The following claims are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (a) claims\n  in small claims court; (b) claims to enforce or to prevent the actual or\n  threatened violation of a party's intellectual property rights; (c) claims for\n  temporary relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy; and (d) claims\n  that are non-arbitrable per the applicable federal statute.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>45. INFORMAL RESOLUTION.\u003C/strong> In an attempt to find the quickest\n  and most efficient resolution of our issues, you and we agree to first discuss\n  any issue informally for at least 30 days, except as provided below. To do\n  that, please send your full name, your email and/or mailing address, your\n  concern, and your proposed solution by certified mail to us at:\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  Fetch Rewards, LLC., Legal Department\u003Cbr />1050 E.

YOU AND WE AGREE TO BEGIN\n  ANY CLAIM AND/OR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE,\n  THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>47.\u003C/strong> WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND\n  STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and\n  Fetch are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by\n  arbitration, except as specified in Section 44 above. There is no judge or\n  jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>48. Taxes.\u003C/strong> You agree that you are solely responsible for all\n  applicable federal, state, local or provincial withholding, taxes, and\n  government fees or costs associated with Points or Rewards and any exchanges\n  and distributions.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>49. Survival.\u003C/strong> Provisions that, by their nature, should\n  survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of\n  example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you\n  have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms\n  regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms that relate to\n  any disputes between you and Fetch.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>50. Severability.\u003C/strong> If any provision of the Terms is for any\n  reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent\n  jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Terms shall be unimpaired and\n  shall remain in full force and effect.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>51. Miscellaneous.\u003C/strong> The failure of either you or us to\n  exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any\n  further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be\n  unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the\n  minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full\n  force and effect and enforceable. You and Fetch agree that these Terms are the\n  complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and\n  Fetch, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral\n  agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject\n  matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a\n  writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). You\n  agree that Fetch has not made, and you have not relied on, any representation\n  by Fetch relating to the Rewards, the Services, or the Fetchrewards.com\n  website, web applications, or mobile application other than those expressly\n  set forth in these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment\n  is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any\n  kind to bind Fetch in any respect whatsoever. You and Fetch agree there are no\n  third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\n  \u003Cstrong>52.
