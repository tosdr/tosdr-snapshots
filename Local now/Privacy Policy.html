Information You Voluntarily Provide</h3><p>We collect information about you when you use the Service, including information you provide when you sign up for our Service; complete a survey; register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes; send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form to receive additional information; sign up for an email newsletter; report weather or other conditions; submit information about yourself (e.g., your gender, age, age range, address, birthday); request alerts or notifications; report locations; or make a purchase from us, contact customer support, or apply for a job. The following categories of information we collect and have collected in the last 12 months:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Contact Data</strong>, including your first and last name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number. <br/></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Account Credentials</strong>, including your username, password, password hints, and information for authentication and account access. <br/></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Demographic Data</strong>, including your age, age range, birthday, gender, and location.<br/></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Billing Data</strong>, including<strong> </strong>your payment instrument number (such as a credit or debit card number), expiration date, and security code as necessary to process your payments.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Profile Data</strong>, including your interests, inferences, preferences, watch lists, and favorites.<br/></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Content</strong>,<strong> </strong>including<strong> </strong>content within any messages you send to us (such as weather reports or conditions, feedback and questions to customer support) or publicly post on the Service (such as in product reviews or blog comments). <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Location information</strong>, including self-reported locations and self-reported zip codes.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h3 id="2-b-information-collected-automatically-internal">B. Information Collected Automatically</h3><p>We also may collect certain information through automated means. The categories of information we automatically collect and may have collected in the last 12 months includes: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Service Use Data,</strong> including data about features you use, pages and channels you visit, emails, content and advertisements you view, products and services you view and purchase, the time of day you view and browse, and your referring and exiting pages.</li><li><strong>Device Data,</strong> including data about the device brand or model, browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address and Ad Id. </li><li><strong>Location Data,</strong> including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level) and, with your consent, precise location data (such as latitude/longitude data). This may include physical geographic location using GPS, cellular network location-based services on your device, and browser services.</li></ul><p>We use various tracking technologies to automatically collect information when you use the Service, including the following:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Log Files,</strong> which are files that record events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, including access times, information related to what you are watching, context/genre of content being watched, and certain related inferences such as audience segments matched utilizing segment user ID. </li><li><strong>Cookies,</strong> which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. </li><li><strong>Pixels and Web Beacons,</strong> which are electronic tags. Certain pages on our sites contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). A pixel tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), which is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on users’ hard drives. These pixel tags collect anonymous data. These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.</li><li><strong>App Technologies,</strong> which are technologies included in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include SDKs (software development kits), which is code that sends information about your use to a server. These SDKs allow us to track our communications, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.  </li><li><strong>Location-Identifying Technologies,</strong> which are technologies used to collect your location. For example, GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth may be used to collect precise location data when you consent to precise location tracking through our apps. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</li><li><strong>Local Shared Objects,</strong> which are stored within your browser on your electronic device used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our sites. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access PII that you have provided on the sites and cannot be accessed by other websites.</li></ul><p>For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, and your rights and choices regarding them, see the “<a href="#6-Analytics-and-Advertising-internal">Analytics and Advertising</a>” and “<a href="#7-Your-Rights-and-Choices-internal">Your Rights and Choices</a>” sections below.</p><h3>C.

Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Services, Plug-Ins and Links</h2><div class="rich-text-block-34 w-richtext"><p>Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, our Services link to pages located on websites, platforms or services maintained by various other entities. These other websites, platforms and services are not bound by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use, and disclosure of PII. We do not control such entities’ data handling practices and we recommend that you review their privacy notices, terms of use, and license agreements prior to using our Service with any such websites or other Internet-based service.</p><p>In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of a Service offered by us such as in the header or footer. In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. You may also encounter third party applications that interact with the Service. The following are some examples of ways our Service may connect you to other unaffiliated websites and Internet-based services: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Links.</strong> Our Service includes links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. We may get a commission if you purchase a product after clicking on a link to such a website. </li><li><strong>Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In.</strong> We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or log-in to your account through social media.

Please note that the social network may independently collect information about you through the integration. </li><li><strong>Voice-Activated Skills.</strong> We may offer skills through Alexa, Google Home, and other voice-activated platforms, and use the voice processing and other technologies discussed in the “<a href="#">Information Collected Automatically</a>” section above. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our skills is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li><li><strong>Platform Linking.</strong> We offer you the ability to link your account to another service in order to retrieve certain data about your account on that service, such as a subscription service. For example, you may authenticate your account with a cable, satellite or IP delivered content provider.</li></ul></div><h2 id="6-Analytics-and-Advertising-internal" class="heading-16">6. Analytics and Advertising</h2><div class="w-richtext"><p>We, our service providers acting on our behalf, and our Vendors, use various Internet technologies which help us to manage the operations of a Service offered by us and track your usage behavior so that we can tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful. </p><p>We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Service. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Service (including IP address) is transmitted to our data collection tool Service Providers like Google. This information is then used by us to evaluate visitors’ use of the Service and to compile statistical reports on Service activity. If you would like to opt-out from the use of your information by Google analytics, you may use <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google’s analytics opt-out browser add-on</a> designed for this purpose. Additional information about how Google uses your personal information (including for its own purposes, e.g., for profiling or linking it to other data), please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google Analytics’ Privacy Policy</a>.  We also use our internal analytics tools to analyze how users use the Service. </p><p>In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. </p><p>As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites, platforms and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).</p><p>We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases (“<strong>Matched Ads</strong>”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or incorporating a pixel from a technology service into our own Service, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of various technologies by advertisers, ad networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies.
