Neither you nor AMG will seek to have a Dispute (defined below) heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties involved therein. “Dispute” includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and AMG concerning the Services or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and AMG empower an arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these Terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any Dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Agreement are void or voidable.</p><p>B. In the event of a Dispute, you or AMG must first send by mail to the other a written notice of the Dispute (“Notice”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Service(s) to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to AMG must be sent by mail to the corporate address provided herein. AMG will send any Notice to you at the contact information it has for you or that you provide. It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. You and AMG will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period, you or AMG may commence an arbitration proceeding. Alternatively, you litigate the Dispute in small claims court if such Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p><p>C. If you and AMG do not resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the Dispute shall be resolved by final, binding arbitration conducted before a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures or pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. The JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. </p><p>D. This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). </p><p>E. In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or AMG) is responsible for paying the filing fee. Each party shall be responsible for and bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><p>F.  You and AMG agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any informal negotiation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision, and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.</p><p>G. This Section 21 shall survive termination of this agreement and/or any subscription to any Services which you may have.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns about the meaning of any provision of this arbitration agreement, please feel free to seek the counsel of an attorney.</p></div><h2>22. <strong>Terms Applicable to Third Party Platform Providers; Third Party Licenses</strong></h2><div class="rich-text-block-29 w-richtext"><p>A.
