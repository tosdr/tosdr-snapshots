<p>2.1	<em>Provision and Access.</em> In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Tailscale shall grant you and your Permitted Users access to and use of the Tailscale Solution as detailed in Documentation solely for your own personal use or internal business purposes (as applicable depending on your Plan). This includes a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to download and use the Tailscale Client Software on Customer Endpoints solely in connection with your use of the Tailscale Solution. You agree that your purchase of the Tailscale Solution is not contingent on the delivery of any future features or functionality, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by us regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<p>2.2	<em>Ownership.</em> As between the Customer and Tailscale, the Tailscale Solution and Documentation, and all intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, are and shall remain the exclusive property of Tailscale. Nothing in the Agreement shall be interpreted to provide Customer with any rights in the foregoing, except the limited right to use the Tailscale Solution subject to the Agreement. You may not, directly or indirectly, do or attempt any of the following: (i) misappropriate or otherwise commercially exploit any part of the Tailscale Solution; (ii) modify, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, or create derivative works from the Tailscale Solution; (iii) damage, tamper with or circumvent any part of the Tailscale Solution; (iv) breach or circumvent any security measure for the Tailscale Solution; (v) access or use the Tailscale Solution to compete with Tailscale or build a competitive product, service or solution; or (vi) access or use the Tailscale Solution for illegal or illicit purposes.</p>

You grant us a limited, nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to transmit Customer Data solely to enable us to provide the Tailscale Solution to you during the Term. Subject to the limited license granted herein, Tailscale acquires no right, title or interest in or to any Customer Data. For the avoidance of doubt, you and your Permitted Users choose what Customer Data to transmit using the Tailscale Solution; Tailscale does not have access to, use of or control over Customer Data, and only you can encrypt/decrypt Customer Data. Tailscale will not make any change to the Tailscale Solution that would enable it to decrypt Customer Data. Tailscale has no general obligation to monitor, and does not monitor, your Customer Data. You are solely responsible for the content of your Customer Data, and represent and warrant that your Customer Data does not violate applicable laws.</p>
<p>2.4	<em>Customer Responsibilities.</em> You will use the Tailscale Solution in accordance with our Documentation and applicable laws. You are solely responsible for: all actions taken through your account by you or your Permitted Users; timely accepting, installing and using Updates; and acquiring, maintaining and securing your own hardware, software, networks and computer systems, which are not included in the Tailscale Solution. You are also responsible for the activity of your Permitted Users and the confidentiality of your and their login credentials. Customer will promptly notify Tailscale of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Tailscale Solution. We reserve the right to suspend, deactivate, or replace a Permitted User account if we determine that such account may have been used to violate any applicable law or not in accordance with the Agreement or Documentation. Any breach of the Agreement by your Permitted Users shall be deemed to be a breach by Customer.</p>
<p>2.5	<em>Third Party Services.</em> The Tailscale Solution may contain, enable or link to third party websites, applications, services or content, including via Integrations (collectively <strong>âThird Party Servicesâ</strong>). We do not own or operate the Third Party Services and cannot guarantee their continued availability or compatibility. We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material made available through Third Party Services. We do not warrant or support the Third Party Services. The availability of such links through the Services does not represent, warrant or imply that we endorse any Third Party Services or any content, materials, opinions, goods or services available on or through them. Our Documentation does not apply to Third Party Services. Your decision to visit or link to a Third Party Service, or to activate an Integration, is your decision and your responsibility. We are not responsible for any security breach of Customer Data or any data or information that is transmitted to, or accessed by, a Third Party Service. If you choose to use an Integration with the Tailscale Solution, you grant us permission to transmit data to the Integration and/or to allow the Integration to access data as necessary for the interoperation of that Integration with the Tailscale Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payment.</strong></p>
<p>This Section 3 only applies to Self-Serve customers.</p>
<p>3.1	<em>Fees.</em> In consideration of the rights granted to Customer and the performance of Tailscaleâs obligations under these Terms, you agree to pay Tailscale the fees and rates associated with your Plan and any add-on services that you choose to purchase (the â<strong>Fees</strong>â). The Fees for your chosen Plan and payment period (typically monthly or annually) will be specified at the time of purchase when you âcheck-outâ on the Tailscale Platform. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise in these Terms, our Documentation or at the time of âcheck-outâ, all payments will be made by credit card. Payments are non-cancelable, non-transferable, non-refundable, and not subject to acceptance, except as expressly stated elsewhere in these Terms. Any permitted suspension of the Tailscale Solution by Tailscale pursuant to these Terms will not excuse you from your obligation to make payments under these Terms.</p>
<p>3.2	<em>Renewals.</em> Your Tailscale account will remain open under your chosen Plan and payment period, and your payment method will continue to be charged applicable Fees, unless and until you change your Plan or close your account. You may change your Plan at any time by following the instructions in our applicable Documentation. If you choose to change your Plan before the close of a payment period, the Fees due at the next payment period will be prorated accordingly, you will remain responsible for any unpaid Fees under the prior Plan, and our services under the prior Plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, renewal of any free, complimentary, promotional or one-time priced services will renew at our applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal.</p>
<p>3.3	<em>Taxes.</em> The Fees set out in these Terms do not include applicable sales, use, gross receipts, value-added, GST or HST, personal property or other taxes (collectively â<strong>Taxes</strong>â). Customer will be responsible for and pay all applicable Taxes, duties, tariffs, assessments, export and import fees or similar charges (including interest and penalties imposed thereon) on the transactions contemplated in connection with these Terms, other than Taxes based on the net income or profits of Tailscale. If Customer is a tax-exempt entity or claims exemption from any Taxes hereunder, Customer will provide a certificate of exemption upon agreement to these Terms and, after receipt of valid evidence of exemption, Tailscale will not charge Customer any Taxes from which Customer is exempt.</p>
<p>3.4	<em>Invoices.</em> Unless set forth otherwise in our Documentation or your invoice, Tailscale will invoice you as of the first day of each payment period for the Fees and Taxes due for the prior payment period. Invoices may be issued by a Tailscale Affiliate. Unless set forth otherwise in your invoice, all invoices are issued in United States dollars, and each invoice is due and payable thirty (30) days from the invoice date according to the payment instructions provided on the invoice. You agree that we may invoice you for any unpaid Fees at any time during the payment period. You may add a purchase order number to an invoice, if necessary for your internal payment processing requirements. If Customer disputes any amount set forth in any invoice, you must notify Tailscale within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date or you will be deemed to have waived your right to dispute such amount. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any payment dispute.</p>
<p>3.5 <em>Delinquent Accounts.</em> In the event of late payments or non-payments of undisputed amounts (collectively, â<strong>Delinquent Accounts</strong>â), Tailscale reserves the right to suspend Customerâs access to and use of the Tailscale Solution and/or charge interest on such past-due amounts until those amounts are paid in full, to be decided by us in our sole discretion. If, after working in good faith with the Customer, Tailscale is not successful in resolving the Delinquent Account, any interest will accrue on past due amounts at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, but in no event greater than the highest rate of interest allowed by law, calculated from the date such amount was due until the date that payment is received by Tailscale. Customer will reimburse Tailscale for the reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Term; Termination.</strong></p>
<p>4.1	<em>Term.</em> These Terms will remain in effect from the day you open your Tailscale account until the earlier of (i) you closing your account or (ii) termination of these Terms by one of the parties as provided herein. The full duration of these Terms is the â<strong>Term</strong>.â</p>
<p>4.2	<em>Closing your account.</em> You may close your account at any time by following the instructions in our Documentation. Any outstanding invoices will become immediately due and payable in accordance with the payment terms set forth in these Terms or on the applicable invoice. Any prepaid fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p>4.3	<em>Termination for cause.</em> Either party may terminate these Terms immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to correct the breach within thirty (30) days following written notice specifying the breach. In addition, if a party becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt, is the subject of any proceedings relating to its liquidation, insolvency, or for the appointment of a receiver, or makes an assignment for the benefit of any creditor, then the other party may terminate these Terms immediately upon written notice. If Customer terminates for cause under this Section 4.3, Tailscale will refund to you on a pro rata basis any prepaid Fees after the effective date of termination. If Tailscale terminates for cause, Customer will remain liable to pay all Fees outstanding as of the effective date of termination, including any unpaid Fees covering the remainder of the payment period had these Terms not been terminated.</p>
<p>4.4	<em>Termination by Tailscale.</em> We reserve the right to terminate these Terms and close your account upon notice to you in the event that we determine we are required to do so by law, in which case we will refund to you any prepaid Fees covering the remainder of your payment period as of the effective date of such termination.</p>
<p>4.5	<em>Effect of termination.</em> Upon termination of these Terms, Customerâs right to access and use the Tailscale Solution will immediately end, and Customer and its Permitted Users will immediately cease all use of the Tailscale Solution. We will have no further obligation to maintain or provide you with access to the Tailscale Solution, including for transition purposes, and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited, delete any associated data in our systems or otherwise in our possession or under our control pursuant to our standard data retention policies and procedures. The parties also will cease any and all use of Confidential Information belonging to the other party, and return or destroy any such Confidential Information upon request. In no event will any termination or expiration relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Expiration or termination of these Terms will not limit either party from pursuing any other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor will any such expiration or termination relieve either partyâs obligation to pay all amounts and Fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by such party under these Terms up to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>4.6	<em>Survival.</em> The rights and obligations of Tailscale and Customer contained in the following sections will survive expiration or termination of these Terms:  Sections 3 (Payment), 4.5 (Effect of termination), 4.6 (Survival), 6 (Confidentiality), 7.3 (Warranty disclaimer), 11 (Indemnification), 12 (Limitations of liability), and 14 (Miscellaneous).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Protection.</strong></p>
<p>5.1	<em>Applicable terms.</em> For business entities or individuals using the Tailscale Solution for business purposes, the Tailscale <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="https://tailscale.com/dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a> (â<strong>DPA</strong>â) is incorporated by reference for compliance with global laws and regulations related to the processing of Personal Data (defined in the DPA) in connection with the Tailscale Solution and the Agreement. If you are an individual using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes, then our <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="https://tailscale.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> applies.</p>
<p>5.2	<em>Security.</em> Tailscale has adopted and will maintain administrative, technical, physical, and organizational security measures that are at least as robust as those described in our DPA as of the effective date of these Terms. Tailscale will not knowingly introduce into the Tailscale Solution any viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses or other malicious code that might harm, or any âcopyleftâ open source license that would require the open licensing of, any Customer systems.</p>
<p>5.3	<em>Usage Data.</em> Customer acknowledges that Tailscale securely processes information, data and metadata resulting from the ordinary course operation and use of the Tailscale Solution for limited internal business purposes related to the ongoing operation, development and protection of the Tailscale Solution, including security and fraud prevention, product analytics, research, debugging and improvement, and billing and customer account management (collectively â<strong>Usage Data</strong>â). Tailscale processes Usage data for such purposes as an independent data controller or business in accordance with applicable Data Privacy Laws (defined in the DPA). Customer acknowledges and agrees that Tailscale may process Usage Data for such purposes, and that such purposes are compatible with, reasonably necessary, and proportionate to providing the Tailscale Solution to Customer. To the extent Usage Data includes any identifying information, Tailscale will de-identify and/or aggregate the Usage Data whenever possible. For the avoidance of doubt, Usage Data does not include Customer Data.</p>
<p>5.4	<em>Acknowledgement.</em> You acknowledge that: (a) Tailscale is not a âBusiness Associateâ as defined in HIPAA and the Tailscale Solution is not HIPAA compliant; (b) Tailscale is not a âbank service providerâ as defined in the Bank Service Company Act; and (c) Tailscale does not act as a âschool officialâ as defined under FERPA, and customers are solely responsible for using the Tailscale Solution only for non-FERPA covered purposes. As a reminder, you and your Permitted Users choose what Customer Data to transmit using the Tailscale Solution; Tailscale does not have access to, use of or control over Customer Data. If you choose to transmit any sensitive information (including information associated with (a)-(c) above, any special categories of data as enumerated in GDPR Article 9(1), and any tax identification numbers, Social Security numbers, driverâs license numbers, or other similar government identification numbers), you are solely responsible for ensuring that suitable safeguards are in place prior to transmitting or processing such information using the Tailscale Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong></p>
<p>The provisions of this clause shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties entered prior to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereto.</p>
<p>6.1	<em>Definition. âConfidential Informationâ</em> means all information disclosed by a party to the other party, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Tailscale Confidential Information includes: the software for the Tailscale Solution, whether in source or executable code; Research (as defined in Section 8.2) materials and information; nonpublic business, product, marketing, pricing and sales information; audit materials and reports; internal policies, procedures and controls; and the results of any performance tests of the Tailscale Solution. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; (ii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party without breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; (iii) is received from a third party without knowledge of any breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that Personal Data (defined in the DPA) is not considered Confidential Information and the terms of the DPA or our Privacy Policy (as  applicable to you), not this Section 6, shall govern the partiesâ obligations with respect to Personal Data.</p>
<p>6.2	<em>Protection of Confidential Information.</em> As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The receiving party will: (a) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care); (b) not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party for any purpose outside the scope of the Agreement; and (c) limit access to Confidential Information of the disclosing party, except as otherwise authorized by the disclosing party in writing, to only those employees, agents and contractors (including its Affiliates, legal counsel, auditors and accountants) who (i) need that access for purposes consistent with the Agreement and (ii) are bound to obligations of confidentiality that are not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those contained in this MSA. Upon the expiration or termination of this MSA, the receiving party shall have no further rights to the disclosing partyâs Confidential Information and shall promptly destroy all materials (whether maintained electronically or otherwise) containing such information, together with all copies thereof in whatever form; provided however that the receiving party may retain copies for archival purposes as required by applicable law or to the extent such copies are electronically stored in accordance with the receiving partyâs document retention or back-up policies or procedures. The receiving partyâs obligations relating to protection of Confidential Information under this MSA shall continue for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except that in the case of Confidential Information that is a trade secret under applicable law, the obligations of confidentiality shall continue for so long as such Confidential Information remains a trade secret.</p>
<p>6.3	<em>Compelled disclosures.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent required by any competent court or governmental agency. Before disclosing such information, the receiving party must (if permitted by law) provide the disclosing party with sufficient advance notice of the request for the information to enable the disclosing party to exercise, at its own cost, any rights it may have to challenge or limit the request to receive such Confidential Information.â If the receiving party is compelled by law to disclose the disclosing partyâs Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, and the disclosing party is not contesting the disclosure, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.</p>
<p>6.4	<em>Availability of injunctive relief.</em> The parties acknowledge that disclosure of any Confidential Information in violation of this Section 6 will give rise to irreparable injury to the owner of such information that is not adequately compensated by damages. Accordingly, each party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance against the breach or threatened breach of the undertakings in this Section 6, in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Warranties &amp; Disclaimers.</strong></p>
<p>7.1	<em>Mutual warranties.</em> Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it is duly authorized to enter into these Terms; (b) it is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its relevant jurisdiction; (c) it has the full right, power and authority to enter into this MSA and perform its obligations hereunder; (d) this MSA is a valid and binding obligation of such party; and (e) it will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its activities related to the Tailscale Solution and the Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2	<em>Limited warranty.</em> Tailscale represents and warrants that: (a) the Tailscale Solution will operate in material and substantial conformity with the Documentation; and (b) Tailscale will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Tailscale Solution; ((a)-(b) collectively the â<strong>Limited Warranty</strong>â)). If Customer notifies Tailscale of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Tailscale will correct the nonconformity. The foregoing constitutes Customerâs sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the Limited Warranty. The Limited Warranty will not apply to any Third Party Service, if caused by any events, systems or circumstances outside our reasonable control, or if caused by Customerâs use of the Tailscale Solution in an unlawful manner or not in accordance with the Agreement or our Documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Disputes; Choice of Law.</strong></p>
<p>10.1 <em>Choice of law.</em> If you are an individual using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes and a resident of Quebec, the Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec and the laws of Canada applicable therein, and the parties will each attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec.

<p>10.2 <strong>Free customers and customers using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes. All Free customers and customers using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes are subject to the terms of <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="#schedule-b">Schedule B</a> attached to these Terms, including, with limited exceptions, the binding arbitration requirements and class action waiver described in <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="#schedule-b">Schedule B</a>. Please read <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="#schedule-b">Schedule B</a> carefully â it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court. Some jurisdictions, including the Province of Quebec, do not allow binding arbitration or the disclaimer of class action rights. Accordingly, some of the terms in <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="#schedule-b">Schedule B</a> may not apply to you or be enforceable with respect to you.</strong></p>
<p>10.3 <em>Self-Serve customers using the Tailscale Solution for business purposes.</em> <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="#schedule-b">Schedule B</a> will not apply to Self-Serve customers using the Tailscale Solution for business purposes. In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or its breach or interpretation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Tailscale and all Self-Serve customers using the Tailscale Solution for business purposes will submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, USA. Each party waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this choice of jurisdiction does not prevent either party from: (i) electing to have any claims resolved in small claims court for disputes and actions within the scope of such courtâs jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of its intellectual property rights in any appropriate jurisdiction (âintellectual property rightsâ in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; or (iii) seeking a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a partyâs claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. The parties hereby waive their right to jury trial with respect to all claims and issues arising under, in connection with, touching upon or relating to the Agreement.</p>
<p>10.4 <em>Statute of limitations.</em> Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Tailscale Solution or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indemnification.</strong></p>
<p>11.1 <em>Indemnification by Tailscale.</em> Tailscale will defend Customer and its Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns, against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third party (other than a Customer Affiliate) alleging that the Tailscale Solution infringes or misappropriates such third partyâs intellectual property rights (a <strong>âClaim Against Customerâ</strong>), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by Tailscale in writing of, a Claim Against Customer. In the event that our right to provide the Tailscale Solution is threatened or enjoined, we may in our sole discretion either obtain the right to continue providing the Tailscale Solution, or replace or modify the Tailscale Solution so that it becomes non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate these Terms upon thirty (30) days written notice without liability to you and refund any prepaid Fees covering the Tailscale Solution on a pro-rata basis following the effective date of such termination. The above defense and indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the Claim Against Customer arises from: (i) Customerâs use of the Tailscale Solution in an unlawful manner; (ii) Customerâs failure to timely install or use Updates when the Tailscale Solution would not infringe had such Updates been so installed or used; (iii) Customer Data; (iv) Customerâs instructions, specifications or requirements to Tailscale; (v) Customerâs combination of the Tailscale Solution with any other software, system, equipment, component, process or material not provided by Tailscale; or (vi) Customerâs use of the Tailscale Solution not in accordance with the Agreement or Documentation.</p>
<p>11.2 <em>Indemnification by Customer.</em> Customer will defend Tailscale and its Affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns, against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Tailscale by a third party (other than a Tailscale Affiliate) arising from: (a) Customerâs use of the Tailscale Solution in violation of our <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="https://tailscale.com/tailscale-aup">Acceptable Use Policy</a>; (b) Customerâs combination of the Tailscale Solution with any other software, system, equipment, component, process or material not provided by Tailscale; or (c) Customer Data; ((a)-(c) each a <strong>âClaim Against Tailscaleâ</strong>); and will indemnify Tailscale from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Tailscale as a result of, or for any amounts paid by Tailscale under a settlement approved by Customer in writing of, a Claim Against Tailscale. The above defense and indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the Claim Against Tailscale arises from Tailscaleâs material breach of the Agreement.</p>
<p>11.3 <em>Indemnification procedures.</em> Each partyâs respective defense and indemnification obligations are contingent upon: (a) the indemnified party providing the defending party with prompt written notice of an eligible claim (no more than thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the claim), as well as reasonable cooperation, assistance and information in the defense and settlement of any claim; and (b) the defending party having sole authority to defend or settle such claim (provided that the defending party will not enter into a settlement that is not confidential, requires an admission of fault, or imposes non-monetary relief without the indemnified partyâs prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnified party will have the right to participate in the defense with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense, provided that such representation does not interfere with the defending partyâs right to control the defense.</p>
<p>11.4 <em>Exclusive remedy.</em> This Section 11 states the indemnifying partyâs sole liability to, and the indemnified partyâs exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third party claim described in this section notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
<p>12.1 <strong>Except for the Excluded Liabilities (defined below), notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary and to the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall either party be liable to the other party for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential, or punitive damages, whether or not such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and whether any claim for recovery is based on theories of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence and strict liability), or otherwise. Some jurisdictions, including the Province of Quebec, do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If you reside in one of those jurisdictions, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</strong></p>
<p>12.2 <strong>Except for the Excluded Liabilities, notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary and to the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall either partyâs aggregate liability to the other in connection with this Agreement or Customerâs access to and use of the Tailscale Solution exceed the greater of: (i) $100; or (ii) the total fees paid or payable by Customer to Tailscale under which the claim arose in the twelve (12) month period preceding the claim or action; regardless of the form or theory of the claim or action.â For greater certainty, the existence of one or more claims under the Agreement will not increase this maximum liability amount.</strong></p>
<p>12.3 For purposes of this Section 12, the âExcluded Liabilities&#x27;&#x27; are any liabilities arising from: (a) indemnification obligations under Section 11 (Indemnification); (b) breach of Section 6 (Confidentiality); (c) breach of Section 2.2 (Ownership); or (d) Customerâs obligation to pay all outstanding Fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade Compliance.</strong></p>
<p>In connection with these Terms, each party agrees to comply with: all relevant export and import laws; and all laws relating to embargoes or sanctions, including the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the Canadian Government, the United States Government, the European Union or its member states, or other applicable government authority (collectively â<strong>Sanctions</strong>â). By accessing and using the Tailscale Solution, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you and your Permitted Users are not: a party on any Sanctions list; owned or controlled by any such party; or located in (or a national of) a country or jurisdiction on any Sanctions list. Any attempt to access or use the Tailscale Solution in breach of the foregoing is considered a material breach of these Terms. We reserve full rights to change or limit access to the Tailscale Solution as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong></p>
<p>14.1 <em>Evaluation Periods.</em> Tailscale may, in its sole discretion, make the Tailscale Solution or certain features or functionality available to you free of charge solely for evaluation purposes for a limited period of time as set forth in an Order Form (the â<strong>Evaluation Period</strong>â). Such Order Form may contain other requirements or limitations related to the Evaluation Period, such as the number of Permitted Users that may access the Tailscale Solution. During the Evaluation Period you agree that you will use the Tailscale Solution solely for internal evaluation purposes and not for commercial use. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, the parties expressly agree that, during and with respect to the Evaluation Period: (a) Tailscale reserves the right to terminate your access to the Tailscale Solution at any time for any reason; (b) the representations and warranties regarding the Tailscale Solution set forth herein, including the Limited Warranty, are not applicable; and (c) Tailscaleâs aggregate liability to you shall not exceed $100.</p>
<p>14.2 <em>Modifications.</em> From time to time, Tailscale may revise these Terms or the other documents comprising the Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by Tailscale, changes become effective for Customer on the date we publish the updated terms or as set forth in any notice we may provide about the changes. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes through communications via Customerâs account, email or other means, and Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the updated terms. If you do not agree to the updated terms, you may close your account as set forth in Section 4.2 above. Continued use of the Tailscale Solution after the updated terms go into effect will constitute Customerâs acceptance of such updated version.</p>
<p>14.3 <em>Assignment.</em> Neither party may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld) except in the event of either: (1) the direct or indirect acquisition of either (a) the majority of voting stock of such party or (b) all or substantially all of the assets of such party, by another entity in a single transaction or a series of transactions; or (2) the merger of such party with another entity. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 14.3 will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</p>
<p>14.4 <em>Notice.</em> Unless otherwise specified: notice to Tailscale must be in writing and sent by email to <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="mailto:legal@tailscale.com">legal@tailscale.com</a>; and notice to Customer will be in writing and sent to the admin email address associated with Customerâs account. You are solely responsible for keeping your contact information on file with Tailscale current at all times during the Term. Notice will be deemed given and received on the business day following the day of actual delivery of the email, unless there is a specific notification that it was not received on the day of actual delivery thereof (ex a bounce back). Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of formal requirements for service of process for initiating litigation or arbitration.</p>
<p>14.5 <em>Force Majeure.</em> Tailscale will not be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations on account of any events beyond our reasonable control that make it impossible or commercially impracticable for us to perform our obligations hereunder, including strikes or other labor problems, material shortages, epidemics, pandemics, civil unrest, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, earthquakes, storms, explosions, cyber attacks, or acts of God, war, terror or government.</p>

<p>14.8 <em>Waiver and severability.</em> The waiver by either party of any default or breach of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.

In the event any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>14.9 <em>Titles and headings.</em> The section titles and headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word âwillâ shall be construed to have the same meaning as âshall.â The words âinclude,â âincludes,â and âincludingâ will be deemed to be followed by âwithout limitation.â The word âorâ will not be exclusive. The phrase âto the extentâ will be construed to mean the degree to which a subject or other matter extends, and such a phrase will not simply mean âif.â Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular will include references to the plural and vice versa. All references to âdaysâ will be deemed to refer to calendar days unless otherwise specifically provided.

<p><strong>This Schedule B applies to Free customers and customers using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes. Please read this Schedule B carefully â it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court. Some jurisdictions, including the Province of Quebec, do not allow binding arbitration or the disclaimer of class action rights. Accordingly, some of the following terms may not apply to you or be enforceable with respect to you.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Initial Dispute Resolution.</em> Our Support team is available to address any concerns you may have regarding the Tailscale Solution. Our Support team can resolve most concerns quickly to your satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Binding Arbitration.</em> If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement (including their formation, performance and breach), the partiesâ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Tailscale Solution shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Streamlined Arbitration and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Except as set forth in Section 5 below, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of the Agreement are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The parties agree that the arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitratorâs award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.</p>
<p>The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, you will be required to pay US$250 to initiate the arbitration. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require Tailscale to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneysâ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Tailscale will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed US$75,000. For claims above US$75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorneyâs fees in certain cases.</p>
<p>Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting partyâs identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).</p>
<p>The parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMSâs Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 2 while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><em>Location.</em> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside of the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and Tailscale agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Class Action Waiver.</em> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <strong>You and Tailscale agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</strong> If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraphâs limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.</em> Notwithstanding the parties&#x27; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that courtâs jurisdiction. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a partyâs claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking such relief shall not waive a partyâs right to arbitration under the Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</em> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the Tailscale Legal team at <a class="underline decoration-blue-50 text-blue-500 underline-offset-4 focus-visible:no-underline hover:decoration-blue-500" href="mailto:legal@tailscale.com">legal@tailscale.com</a>. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of the Agreement, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Tailscale also will not be bound by them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Changes to this Schedule.</em> Tailscale will provide 30 daysâ notice of any changes to this Schedule B. Changes will become effective on the 30th day. If you continue to use our websites or the Tailscale Solution after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Tailscale does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Other disputes.</em> For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Tailscale agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Free customer, an individual using the Tailscale Solution for personal or household purposes, and a resident of the Province of Quebec, any claim or dispute relating to the Tailscale Solution or these Terms that is not resolved under the arbitration requirements of this Schedule B, not subject to the exceptions to arbitration set out in Section 5 above, and not resolved through the informal dispute resolution procedure set out in Section 1 above will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Province of Quebec.</p></div></article><aside class="col-span-12 md:col-span-4"><div class="top-20 max-w-xs rounded bg-stone-100 px-4 py-4 text-base md:sticky md:text-sm"><h4 class="mb-2 font-semibold
