Agreement, Customer will: (a) pay an additional amount such

all such withholdings (including any withholdings to be made
in respect of any additional amount payable pursuant to this
sentence), equal the full amount of the payment then due; (b)
pay, or cause to be paid, to the relevant taxation authority
the full amount of such withholdings (including the full
amount of any withholdings in respect of any additional
payment required to be paid pursuant to this sentence) in
accordance with applicable law; and (c) furnish Tailscale as
soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) with
an official receipt (or a certified copy thereof) or such
other documentation as is reasonably acceptable to Tailscale
evidencing payment of such withholdings to the relevant
taxation authority. In connection with this obligation,
Customers that are not Canadian companies but that are subject
to HST and/or GST must notify Tailscale in advance of making
any payments hereunder.</p>
<p>8.6.  <em>Suspension.</em> Any permitted suspension of the Tailscale Solution
by Tailscale pursuant to the Agreement will not excuse
Customer from its obligation to make payments under the
Agreement.</p>

Discloser&rsquo;s Confidential Information does not include, except
with respect to Personal Data: (i) information already known
or independently developed by Recipient without access to
Discloser&rsquo;s Confidential Information; (ii) information that is
publicly available through no wrongful act of Recipient;
or (iii) information received by Recipient from a third party
who was free to disclose it without confidentiality
obligations.</p>
<p>9.2.  <em>Confidentiality Covenants.</em> Recipient hereby agrees that it
will not, except to exercise its rights or perform its
obligations under the Agreement: (i) disclose Confidential
Information of the Discloser to any person, except to its own
personnel or Affiliates that have a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; and that
have entered into written agreements no less protective of
such Confidential Information than this Section 9, and to such
other recipients as the Discloser may approve in writing; (ii)
use Confidential Information of the Discloser; or (iii) alter
or remove from any Confidential Information of the Discloser
any proprietary legend. Each Party will take industry standard
precautions to safeguard the other Party&rsquo;s Confidential
Information, which will in any event be at least as stringent
as the precautions that the Recipient takes to protect its own
Confidential Information of a similar type.</p>
<p>9.3.  <em>Exceptions to Confidentiality.</em> Notwithstanding Section 9.2,
Recipient may disclose Discloser&rsquo;s Confidential
Information: (i) to the extent that such disclosure is
required by applicable law or by the order of a court or
similar judicial or administrative body, provided that, except
to the extent prohibited by law, the Recipient promptly
notifies the Discloser in writing of such required disclosure
and cooperates with the Discloser to seek an appropriate
protective order; or (ii) to its legal counsel and other
professional advisors if and to the extent such persons need
to know such Confidential Information in order to provide
applicable professional advisory services in connection with
the Party&rsquo;s business; or (iii) in the case of Tailscale, to
potential assignees, acquirers or successors of Tailscale if
and to the extent such persons need to know such Confidential
Information in connection with a potential sale, merger,
amalgamation or other corporate transaction involving the
business or assets of Tailscale.</p>
<p>9.4.  <em>Injunctive Relief</em>. The Recipient acknowledges that disclosure
of any Confidential Information by it except as set forth in
Section 9.3 will give rise to irreparable injury to the
Discloser or the owner of such information, not adequately
compensated by damages. Accordingly, the Discloser will be
entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and
specific performance against the breach or threatened breach
of the undertakings in this Section 9, in addition to any
other legal remedies which may be available.</p>
<p>9.5.  <em>Return or Destruction of Confidential Information</em>. Upon the
termination or expiration of this Agreement each Party will
promptly destroy (or, if requested by the other Party in
writing, return) all Confidential Information (excluding any
Personal Data, which will be governed by the DPA) of the other
Party in its possession or control within a reasonable amount
of time in accordance with the Recipient&rsquo;s data destruction
practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may
retain copies of the Confidential Information of the Discloser
as required by applicable law, or to the extent such copies
are electronically stored in accordance with the Recipient&rsquo;s
standard backup procedures or record retention policies, so
long as such Confidential Information remains subject to the
confidentiality provisions set out in this Agreement. Each
Party will protect any Confidential Information of the other
Party in accordance with this Agreement so long as it retains
such Confidential Information.</p>

From time to time, Tailscale may, in its sole discretion, invite
a Customer to use, on a trial basis, pre-release or beta products
or features that are in development and not yet available to all
Customers (each, a &ldquo;<strong>Trial Feature</strong>&rdquo;). All Customers invited to use
one or more Trial Features may use such Trial Features only for
internal evaluation purposes in a production environment, and not
for any commercial use. No fees shall be payable in connection

associated conversations and materials relating thereto (including
any feedback received from Customer regarding the Trial Features),
will be considered Tailscaleâs Confidential Information and subject
to the confidentiality provisions in this Agreement. Customer agrees
that it will not make any public statements or otherwise disclose
its use of the Trial Features without Tailscaleâs prior written
consent. Further, Tailscale makes no representations or warranties
regarding the Trial Features. Tailscale may discontinue a Customerâs
access to any of the Trial Features at any time in its sole
discretion, with or without notice to Customer. In such event,
Customer shall immediately delete any data or other information it
has in its possession related to the Trial Feature. Tailscale may
decide not to release a final or commercial version of a Trial
Feature in its sole discretion and, if it offers a Trial Feature
commercially, may choose not to make it available to all Customers
who had access to it as a Trial Feature. In addition to the foregoing,
use of a Trial Feature may be subject to additional terms and
conditions that Tailscale makes available to Customer prior to
Customerâs use of such Trial Feature.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &ndash; IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
<p>16.1.  <em>Initial Dispute Resolution.</em> Our Customer Support Department is
available via the Site to address any concerns you may have
regarding the Service. Our Customer Support Department can resolve
most concerns quickly to your satisfaction. The Parties shall use
their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle
any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good
faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party
initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this
process could result in the award of fees against you in
arbitration.</p>
<p>16.2.  <em>Binding Arbitration.</em> If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon
solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute
resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision,
then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole
means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.
Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to the
Agreement (including their formation, performance and breach), the
Parties&rsquo; relationship with each other and/or your use of the
Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its
Streamlined Arbitration and Procedures, excluding any rules or
procedures governing or permitting class or representative
actions.<br>
<br>
Except as set forth in Section 16.5, the arbitrator, and not any
federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to
the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or
any part of the Agreement are void or voidable, whether a claim is
subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of
JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of
such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall
be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a
court under law or in equity. The Parties agree that the
arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are
likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The
arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be written, and binding on the Parties
and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any
preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with
anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.<br>
<br>
The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be
accessed at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.
If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, you
will be required to pay US$250 to initiate the arbitration. To
the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of
filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require Tailscale to pay the
additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys&rsquo; fees
unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide
otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be
non-frivolous, Tailscale will pay all of the actual filing and
arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not
exceed US$75,000. For claims above US$75,000, fees and costs
will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The
arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney&rsquo;s fees in certain
cases.<br>
<br>
Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party
must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the
other party of the asserting party&rsquo;s identity, the claims being
asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The
arbitrator and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or
counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The
arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with
JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be
frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 11).<br>
<br>
The Parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or
timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS&rsquo;s
Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification
does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to
such fee modification. The Parties also agree that a good-faith
challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not
constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 16 while
such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or
a court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
The Parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they
would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They
further understand that, in some instances, the costs of
arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<p>16.3.  <em>Location.</em> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration
will take place at any reasonable location within the United
States convenient for you. For residents outside of the United
States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York,
State of New York, United States of America, and you and Tailscale
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or
state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel
arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by
the arbitrator.</p>
<p>16.4.  <em>Class Action Waiver.</em> The Parties further agree that any
arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only
and not as a class action or other representative action, and the
Parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek
relief on a class basis. YOU AND TAILSCALE AGREE THAT EACH MAY
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a final judicial
determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this
Paragraph&rsquo;s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that
remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration
and may be sought in court. The Parties agree, however, that any
adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be
stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</p>
<p>16.5.  <em>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
Court Claims.</em> Notwithstanding the Parties' decision to resolve
all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action
in state or federal court to protect its Intellectual Property
Rights (but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may
also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims
court that are within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.
Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other
equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding
whether a party&rsquo;s claims are time-barred or may be brought in
small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking
such relief shall not waive a party&rsquo;s right to arbitration under
the Agreement.</p>
<p>16.6.  <em>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</em> You have the right to opt-out and not be
bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out
to the following address: Tailscale Inc., 125-720 King St. West
Suite 585 Toronto, ON M5V 3S5. The notice must be sent within 30
days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be
bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those
paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions,
Tailscale also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>16.7.  <em>Changes to this Section.</em> Tailscale will provide 30 days&rsquo; notice of
any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the
30th day. If you continue to use the Site or the Tailscale
Solution after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of
which Tailscale does not have actual notice are subject to the
revised clause.<br>
<br>
For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Tailscale agree
to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue
in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY. You
further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby
waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise
available.<br>
<br>
The Terms and the relationship between you and Tailscale shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to
conflict of law provisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>17.1.  <em>Statute of Limitations.</em> You agree that regardless of any
statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
arising out of or related to the use of the Service or the
Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or
cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<p>17.2.  <em>Section Titles.</em> The section titles in the Terms are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
<p>17.3.  <em>Export Restrictions.</em> Customer agrees not to directly or
indirectly export, re-export or import all or any portion of
the Service without first obtaining all required licenses,
permits and permissions. Tailscale makes no representation or
warranty that the Service may be exported without Customer
first obtaining appropriate licenses or permits under
applicable law, or that any such license or permit has been,
will be, or can be obtained.</p>
<p>17.4.  <em>Construction</em>. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement,
the Parties&rsquo; rights and remedies under the Agreement are
cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights and remedies available at law or in
equity or otherwise. The terms &ldquo;include&rdquo; and &ldquo;including&rdquo; mean,
respectively, &ldquo;include without limitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;including
without limitation.&rdquo; The headings of sections of the Agreement
are for reference purposes only and have no substantive
effect.</p>
<p>17.5.  <em>Force Majeure.</em> Neither Party will be liable for delays caused
by any event or circumstances beyond that Party&rsquo;s reasonable
control, including acts of God, acts of government, flood,
fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or
other labour problems (other than those involving that Party&rsquo;s
employees), Internet service failures or delays, or the
unavailability or modification by third parties of
telecommunications or hosting infrastructure or third-party
websites (&ldquo;Force Majeure Event&rdquo;).</p>
<p>17.6.  <em>Assignment.</em> Tailscale may, upon giving written notice to you,
assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement to any
of its Affiliates or pursuant to a merger, amalgamation or
other corporate reorganization or a sale of all or
substantially all of its assets relating to that portion of
its business that delivers the Service. In this case, such
assignee will have and may exercise all the rights, and will
assume all of the obligations, of Tailscale under the
Agreement, except that the assignment will not release
Tailscale from liability for Tailscale&rsquo;s obligations under the
Agreement. Except for such permitted assignment, neither Party
may assign the Agreement or any rights or obligations under
the Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the
other Party. The Agreement enure to the benefit of and is
binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.</p>
<p>17.7.  <em>Severability</em>. Any provision of the Agreement found by a
tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable will be severed from the Agreement
and all other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full
force and effect.</p>
<p>17.8.  <em>Waiver</em>. A waiver of any provision of the Agreement will be in
writing and a waiver in one instance will not preclude
enforcement of such provision on other occasions.</p>
<p>17.9.  <em>Independent Contractors.</em> Tailscale&rsquo;s relationship to you is
that of an independent contractor, and neither Party is an
agent or partner of the other. Neither Party will have, and
neither Party will represent to any third party that it has,
any authority to act on behalf of the other Party.</p>
<p>17.10. <em>Entire Agreement.</em> The Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
agreements, representations or other communications between
the Parties, whether written or oral. Any terms and conditions
appearing on a purchase order or similar document issued by
Customer, or in Customer&rsquo;s procurement, invoicing, or vendor

Solution; (ii) do not override or form a part of this
Agreement (including without limitation any Order Form);

explicitly set forth hereunder, no person or entity will be a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have any right or
cause of action hereunder.</p>
