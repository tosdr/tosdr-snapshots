We will not send you any marketing email (spam), and we will not sell your name or contact information to anyone for marketing. We will not identify you, your name or email address (if we should know them) in anything we make public. We collect regular web server logs, and may use the data and submitted code as part of research into teaching technology in action, but we will never make public or share email addresses or any other PII.

Note that the "done" page for a user may include their email address, but making that page public is done by the user themselves. By default, the done page is seen only by the user themselves. We may provide a "hide my email" feature on the done page so people can make that page public but still conceal their email.
