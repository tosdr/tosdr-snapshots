The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California, and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p><b>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</b>Unless you and Cricbuzz agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration shall be in Northern California. If your claim does not exceed USD $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Cricbuzz submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds USD $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.</p><p><b>Arbitrator’s Decision and Governing Law.</b>The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the “Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability” section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p><p><b>Fees.</b>Each party’s responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and shall be set forth in the AAA Rules.</p><p><b>Limited Time to Notify and Bring Claim.</b>UNLESS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW THAT ESTABLISHES A DIFFERENT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DISPUTES MUST BE REPORTED TO CRICBUZZ WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p></li><li><h4>Governing Law</h4><p>Except as provided in Section 14 or expressly provided in writing otherwise, this Agreement and your use of the Services will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.
