<h3 id="what-policy-covers">What this Non-Student User Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p class="p2">This Non-Student User Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when Non-Student Users access or use our Services. As a Non-Student User, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Tynker.</p>
<p class="p2">“Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or control or people we don’t manage. For the avoidance of doubt, when we use the term “Personal Data” in this Non-Student User Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information of Non-Student Users, and we use the term “Student User’s Personal Data” or “Personal Data of Student User” to refer to personally identifiable information of Student Users under 18 years old. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As explained above, our collection and processing of Student User’s Personal Data is governed by the <a href="/privacy/student"><span class="s2">Student User Privacy Policy</span></a>, and the <a href="https://tynker.com/terms/educational-institution"><span class="s2">Additional Terms for Student Data from Educational Institution</span></a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-student-users-personal-data-treated">How is Student User’s Personal Data Treated?</h3>
<p class="p2">The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If you are a child under 13 years of age, please do not attempt to send any Personal Data about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you are 13 years old or under, you may only use Tynker Services and disclose Personal Data (except for Required Information) to us with Parental Consent. </p>
<p class="p2">If you believe that a child under 13 years of age has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tynker.com"><span class="s2">support@tynker.com</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a child under 13 years of age than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain Personal Data from children under 13 years of age longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.</p>
<p class="p2">If you are a parent or guardian of a user of our Services who is under 13 years of age, you may contact us at any time to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such Student User, (b) we delete any Personal Data already collected from such Student User (although note that we may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify such Student User personally), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such Student User to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such Student User in connection with the Services. </p>
<p class="p2">If you’re above the age of 13 but under the age of 18, you represent and warrant that you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to our <a href="/terms/"><span class="s2">Terms of Use</span></a> on your behalf and also to agree on their own behalf. </p>
<p class="p2">For Student User, no matter whether you’re under the age of 13 or above, your parent or guardian, teacher, or school administrator can view all information within or associated with your Tynker account, including, without limitation, messages between you and your teacher, your work assignments and results, comments you received on your assignments, and your projects saved in your account. </p>
<p class="p2">As noted above, our collection and processing of Student User’s Personal Data is governed by the <a href="/privacy/student"><span class="s2">Student User Privacy Policy</span></a>, and the <a href="https://tynker.com/terms/educational-institution"><span class="s2">Additional Terms for Student Data from Educational Institution</span></a>. Please review those for more details. </p>

<p class="p6">We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services to Non-Student Users. These advertisements may be targeted to Non-Student Users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular Non-Student Users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking Non-Student Users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when they leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p class="p4">We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer’s online behavior across different websites and properties. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt-out pages, which are located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. </p>
<h3 id="data-security-retention">Data Security and Retention</h3>
<p class="p4">We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. We do so by, in part, maintaining a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Data against risks – such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure – through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.</p>
<p class="p4">We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us and no longer than is necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p>
<h3 id="california-resident-rights">California Resident Rights</h3>
<p class="p2">If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>
<p class="p2">If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tynker.com"><span class="s2">support@tynker.com</span></a>.</p>
<h4>Access</h4>
<p class="p2">You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient.</p>
<h4>Deletion</h4>
<p class="p4">You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. </p>
<h4 id="personal-data-sales-opt-out-and-opt-in">Exercising Your Rights</h4>
<p class="p4">To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
<p class="p4">We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
<p class="p4">You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Email us at: <a href="mailto:support@tynker.com"><span class="s1">support@tynker.com</span></a> </span></li>
<li>Submit a form at this address: <a href="https://tynker.com/about/contact"><span class="s2">https://tynker.com/about/contact</span></a> </li>
</ul>
<p class="p6">You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>
<h4>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In</h4>
<p class="p4">We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of users under 18 years of age. </p>
<p class="p10">In this section, we use the term “sell” as it is defined in the CCPA. As described in the “Tracking Tools, Advertising and Opt-Out” section above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the CCPA, sharing your data through third party Cookies for online advertising may be considered a “sale” of information. For California residents, we have enabled the Restricted Data Processing for Google Analytics, and Limited Data Use for Facebook Pixel, and we do not use any other Analytics Cookies or Retargeting Cookies that we think would constitute “sale” under the CCPA. With such settings, Google and Facebook act as our service provider, and they will ensure that our sharing of your Personal Data with them does not constitute “sale” under the CCPA. For more information regarding such settings, please review the details for Google Analytics<span class="s10">: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9614122?hl=en"><span class="s2">https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9614122?hl=en</span></a></span>, and for Facebook Pixel:<span class="s10"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/state-specific"><span class="s2">https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/state-specific</span></a>.</span> </p>
<h4>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</h4>
<p class="p4">We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.<span class="s11"><b> </b></span></p>
<h3 id="other-state-law-privacy-rights">Other State Law Privacy Rights</h3>
<h4>California Resident Rights</h4>
<p class="p4">Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tynker.com"><span class="s2">support@tynker.com</span></a>. </p>
<h4>Nevada Resident Rights</h4>
<p class="p4">If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data. For clarity, we do not engage in such activities of “sale” of your Personal Data to third parties as defined under Nevada law. </p>
<h3 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p class="p4">We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will alert you to any material changes by placing a notice on the Tynker website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
<h3 id="contact-information">Contact Information:</h3>
<p class="p2">If you have any questions or comments about this Non-Student Privacy Policy, the ways in which we collect and use Non-Student Users’ Personal Data or your choices and rights regarding such collection and use, please do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
