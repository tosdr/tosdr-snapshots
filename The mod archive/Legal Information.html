<br />
7. ACCESS RESTRICTION AND SERVICE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION: The Mod Archive reserves the right in its sole discretion to deny you access to the Website and/or the Website Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice and for any reason including, without limitation, if you fail to comply with any clause 5 (Member Conduct) or any other provision of these Terms.

The Mod Archive reserves the right to update these Terms from time to time. If it does so, the updated version will be effective as soon as it is uploaded on to this the Website and your continued use of the Website Service following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Dutch law and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dutch Courts in relation to any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or your use of the Website and/or the Website Service.<br />
If any provision(s) of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties (as reflected in the provision(s)) and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.<br />
The Mod Archive&#039;s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by The Mod Archive in writing.<br />
Unless otherwise expressly stated, nothing in the Terms shall create any rights or any other benefits whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise in favour of any person other than you and The Mod Archive. <br />
