<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">Certain features of the Service may
require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an
opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged.
All fees are in the currencies provided on the Doist website and,
except as expressly provided by applicable law, are non-refundable,
except required by law.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">4.1. <strong>Price</strong>. Doist reserves the right to determine pricing for the
Service. Doist will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing
information published on the website up to date which is
available on our <a class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23 _link_l3gwj_1" href="https://todoist.com/pricing" style="display:inline;word-break:break-all">pricing page</a>
(the &quot;<strong>Pricing Page</strong>&quot;). All prices are shown on the Pricing
Page. Any applicable sales taxes, levies, value-added taxes, or
duties imposed by taxing authorities are calculated during the
check-out based on your location . We encourage you to check our
website periodically for current pricing information. Doist may
change the price of any feature of the Service; if this occurs,
Doist will provide you advance notice of the changes before they
apply. Doist, at its sole discretion, may make promotional
offers with different features and different pricing to any of
Doist&#x27;s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you,
will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">4.2. <strong>Authorization</strong>. You authorize Doist and its third-party
payment processors to charge all sums for the orders that you
make and any level of Service you select as described in these
Terms or published by Doist, including all applicable taxes, to
the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any
fees with a credit card, Doist or its third-party payment
processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card
account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is
valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover
your purchase.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">4.3. <strong>Subscription Service</strong>. The Service may include automatically
recurring payments for periodic charges (&quot;<strong>Subscription
Service</strong>&quot;). If you activate a Subscription Service, you
authorize Doist or its third-party payment processors to
periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until
cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account,
all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the
accrued sums. The &quot;<strong>Subscription Billing Date</strong>&quot; is the date
when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For
information on the &quot;<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>&quot;, please see
our <a class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23 _link_l3gwj_1" href="https://todoist.com/pricing" style="display:inline;word-break:break-all">Pricing Page</a>.
Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription
Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next
subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be
billed on the same day each month). The subscription will
continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we
terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews
in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee
to your account. Doist or its third-party payment processor will
bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you
provide to us during registration (or to a different payment
method if you change your payment information). You may cancel
the Subscription Service by following the instructions provided
at the following links for <a class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23 _link_l3gwj_1" href="https://todoist.com/help/articles/6039358868380" style="display:inline;word-break:break-all">Todoist Pro</a>,

<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">4.4. <strong>Delinquent Accounts</strong>. Doist may suspend or terminate access
to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for

to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be
charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any
chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including
collection fees.</p>

<h2 class="_text_140os_1 _major-base_140os_91" id="20-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration">20. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.1. <strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you
and Doist in the most expedient and cost-effective manner,
subject to all applicable laws and except as described in
Section 20.2 (<em>Exceptions</em>) and 20.3 (<em>Opt-Out</em>), you and Doist
agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms
and your use of the Service will be resolved by binding
arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and
can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can
award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This
agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out
of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or your use of the
Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these
Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE
TERMS, YOU AND DOIST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If you reside in a
country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with
laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their
local courts, this Section 20 (<em>Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration</em>) does not affect those requirements.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.2. <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Despite the provisions of Section 20.1
(<em>Generally</em>), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a)
bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an
enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or
local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive
relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file
suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
infringement claim.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.3. <strong>Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding
arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section
20 (<em>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</em>) within 30 days after
the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to
Doist Inc., Attention: Legal Department -- Arbitration Opt-Out,
2100 Geng Road, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303 that specifies:
your full legal name, the email address associated with your
account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out
of arbitration (&quot;<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>&quot;). Once Doist receives your
Opt-Out Notice, this Section 20 (<em>Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration</em>) will be void and any action arising out of these
Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 21.2 (<em>Governing
Law</em>). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be
affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.4. <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Doist will be
settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by
the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;) under its
Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &quot;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&quot;) as
modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
available online
at <a class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23 _link_l3gwj_1" href="http://www.adr.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="display:inline;word-break:break-all">www.adr.org</a>, by calling
the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Doist. The
arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability
of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.5. <strong>Notice of Arbitration; Process.</strong> A party who intends to seek
arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to
the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express
(signature required) or, only if that other party has not
provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
(&quot;<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>&quot;). Doist&#x27;s address for Notice is:
Doist Inc., 2100 Geng Road, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303. The
Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of
the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief
sought (&quot;<strong>Demand</strong>&quot;). The parties will make good faith efforts
to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach
an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of
Arbitration is received, you or Doist may commence an
arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the
parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the
parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any
settlement offer made by you or Doist must not be disclosed to
the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision
and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher
than the last written settlement amount offered by Doist in
settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Doist will pay to
you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator;
or (ii) $10,000.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.6. <strong>Fees.</strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these
Terms, Doist will reimburse you for your payment of the filing
fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case
the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any
arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed
upon in New Castle County, Delaware, but if the claim is for
$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone
hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the
AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If
the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or
the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree
to reimburse Doist for all monies previously disbursed by it
that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient
to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement
of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon
request from either party made within 14 days of the
arbitrator&#x27;s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.7. <strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND DOIST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Doist
agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
one person&#x27;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.8. <strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Doist makes
any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a
change to Doist&#x27;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may
reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of
the change to Doist&#x27;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in
which case your account with Doist will be immediately
terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect
immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">20.9. <strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section 20.7 (<em>No Class Actions</em>) or the
entirety of this Section 20 (<em>Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration</em>) is found to be unenforceable, or if Doist receives
an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 20
(<em>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</em>) will be null and void
and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in
Section 21.2 (<em>Governing Law</em>) will govern any action arising
out of or related to these Terms.</p>

<p class="_text_140os_1 _inherit_140os_23">21.1. <strong>General Terms.</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy

failure to require performance of any provision will not affect
our right to require performance at any other time after that,

Throughout these Terms the use of the word &quot;including&quot; means
