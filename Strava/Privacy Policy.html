<h2>Information Strava Collects</h2>
<p>Strava collects information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, if you or your other Strava users choose to share it with Strava. We receive information in a few different ways, including when you track, complete or upload activities using the Services. Strava also collects information about how you use the Services. There are also several opportunities for you to share information about yourself, your friends, and your activities with Strava. For example:</p>
<section id='account_profile_activity_and_use_information'>
<h3>Account, Profile, Activity, and Use Information</h3>
<p>We collect <b>basic account information</b> such as your name, email address, date of birth, gender, weight, username and password that helps secure and provide you with access to our Services. We also use dates of birth to enhance safety and privacy for our younger users, to place you on age-group leaderboards, and to provide more accurate performance analysis.</p>
<p><b>Profile, activity and use information</b> is collected about you when you choose to upload a picture, video, post, or activity (including date, time and geo-location information as well as your speed and pace and perceived exertion), join a challenge, add your equipment usage, view others' activities, or otherwise use the Services.</p>
<p>We use your <b>contact information</b> so we can contact you when needed. For example, to respond to your support requests.</p>
</section>
<section id='location_information'>
<a name='location'></a>
<h3>Location Information</h3>
<p>We collect and process <b>location information</b> when you sign up for and use the Services. We do not track your device location while you are not using the Services. But in order to use our core features (e.g., GPS activity tracking, routes, segment leaderboards, etc.), it is necessary for you to permit us to track your device location while you use the Services. If you would like to stop the device location tracking, you may do so at any time by adjusting your device settings.</p>
</section>
<section id='content_you_share'>
<h3>Content You Share</h3>
<p>We gather information from the photos, videos, posts, comments, kudos, ratings, reviews, and <b>other content you share on the Services</b>, including when you participate in partner events or create segments or routes.</p>
</section>
<section id='contacts_information'>
<a name='contacts_information'></a>
<h3>Contacts Information</h3>
<p>You can choose to add your <b>contacts' information</b> by connecting your contacts from your mobile device or social networking accounts to Strava. If you choose to share your contacts with Strava, we will, in accordance with your instructions, access and store your contacts' information in order to identify potential connections and help you connect with them. <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/articles/360016371512'>Learn more</a> about how we collect information about your contacts, how we use that information, and the controls available to you.</p>

</section>
<section id='health_information'>
<a name='health_information'></a>
<h3>Health Information</h3>
<p>Strava may collect or infer <b>health information</b>. Certain health information may be inferred from sources such as heart rate or other measurements, including power, cadence, and weight or other indicators. Before you can upload health information to Strava, you must give your explicit <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/articles/360000556410-How-Strava-Uses-Health-Related-Data'>consent</a> to the processing of that health information by Strava. You can withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health information at any time. You can also <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028654291-Hide-Stats-from-your-Activities'>hide certain statistics</a>, such as your heart rate, from being viewed by others on individual activities.</p>
</section>
<section id='payment_information'>
<h3>Payment Information</h3>
<p>When you make a payment on Strava, you may provide <b>payment information</b> such as your payment card or other payment details. We use Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant third-party payment services and we do not store your credit card information.</p>
</section>
<section id='third_party_accounts'>
<h3>Third-Party Accounts</h3>
<p>Strava allows you to sign up and log in to the Services using accounts you create with third-party products and services, such as Meta, Google, or Apple (collectively, “Third-Party Accounts”). If you access the Services with <b>Third-Party Accounts</b> we will collect information that you have agreed to make available such as your name, email address, profile information and preferences. This information is collected by the Third-Party Account providers and is provided to Strava under their privacy policies. You can generally control the information that we receive from these sources using the privacy controls in your Third-Party Account.</p>
</section>
<section id='technical_information'>
<a name='technical'></a>
<h3>Technical Information and Log Files</h3>
<p>We collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device, which provides us with technical information when you access or use the Services. This technical information includes device and network information, cookies, log files and analytics information. Learn more about how we use cookies and manage your preferences by visiting our <a href='https://www.strava.com/legal/cookie_policy'>Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<p>The Services use <b>log files</b>. The information stored in those files includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer, protect and secure the Services, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information (e.g., country residence) for aggregate use. IP addresses may be linked to session IDs, athlete IDs and device identifiers.</p>

<h2>How Strava Uses Information</h2>
<p>Strava uses the information we collect and receive as described below.</p>
<section id='to_provide_the_services'>
<a name='to-provide-the-services'></a>
<h3>To provide the Services</h3>
<p>We use the information we collect and receive to provide the Services, including providing you with the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Record your activities and analyze your performance</b>. For example, to compare your past efforts, analyze your training, and - with your consent - use your heart rate information to provide you with interesting and useful performance analysis. We may also match your GPS activities to specific segments or routes to analyze your efforts against those of other users and to establish leaderboards.</li>
<li><b>Interact with other users</b>. For example, to compete on segments, participate in clubs, challenges, or events, follow other users, message other users, and use features that help users interact with one another, such as group activities or <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015478252-Flybys-Privacy-Controls'>flyby</a>.</li>
<li><b>Manage your training</b>. For example, to set goals and use your training dashboard.</li>
<li><b>Explore new places to go</b>. For example, to discover routes or segments where you can engage in your activity. Similarly, if several users run a specific route, that information may be used to suggest the route to other users.</li>
<li><b>Visualize your activities in new ways</b>. For example, by creating <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918467-Personal-Heatmaps'>personal heatmaps</a> or using your training log.</li>
<li><b>Share insights with the Strava community</b>. For example, by sharing your public reviews and photos of specific routes or segments. We may also analyze your public photos from specific routes or segments to attach characteristics to those routes or segments (e.g., shaded, waterfalls, flowers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to your <a href='https://www.strava.com/settings/privacy'>privacy controls</a>, your information, including parts of your profile, username, photos/videos, users you follow and who follow you, clubs you belong to on Strava, your activities, the devices you use, and kudos and comments you give and receive will be shared on Strava so that you may be able to participate in the Services, for example to show your place on a leaderboard. <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034758331-Your-Privacy-Defaults-When-You-Create-a-Strava-Account'>Certain information</a> (e.g., your name, and some profile information) is also available to non-users on the web. Your precise location information, such as where you run or ride, may also be shared on Strava or to non-users, in accordance with your privacy controls.</p>
</section>
<section id='to_provide_the_messaging_services'>
<a name='to-provide-the-messaging-services'></a>

Your name and other <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/articles/115000164850-Profile-Page-Privacy-Controls'>profile information</a> is viewable by other Strava users and the public and, subject to your privacy controls, additional information and content you share may also be viewable.

<h2>Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our services are not intended for, nor directed to, children under 13 years of age. We use technical measures to prevent children under 13 years of age from creating an account and therefore do not knowingly collect personal information from anybody under 13 years of age. <b>If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Services</b>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we strive to provide additional privacy and safety protections for individuals under 18 years of age. For example, when users under 18 years of age create an account, their profile and activities are set by default to be viewable by <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034758331-Your-Privacy-Defaults-When-You-Create-a-Strava-Account'>followers only</a>.

<section id='our_legal_bases'></section>
<h3>Our Legal Bases</h3>
<p>Strava relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a>. For example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your location information;</li>
<li>where you have consented to the processing;</li>
<li>where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;</li>
<li>to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies; and</li>
<li>where necessary for the purposes of Strava's or a third party's <a href='https://www.strava.com/legal/legal_bases#legitimate_interests'>legitimate interests</a>, such as our interests in protecting our users, our partners' interests in collaborating with our users, and our commercial interests in ensuring the sustainability of the Services.</li>

<section id='transfers'>
<h2>Cross Border Data Transfers</h2>
<p>The Services are operated from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id='retention'>
<a name='retention'></a>
<h2>Retention of Information</h2>
<p>We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information. Information associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until your account is deleted or becomes inactive. In making these determinations, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the purposes for which the information is processed, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, you can delete some items of information (e.g., profile information) and you can remove individual activities from view on the Services without deleting your account. For example, if you withdraw your <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000556410'>consent</a> to Strava processing your health-related information, Strava will thereafter delete all health-related information from activities you upload. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 45 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a> and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information connected to you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services to you may be de-identified or aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights that are commercially valuable to Strava, such as statistics of the use of the Services. For example, we may <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/articles/216918827-Delete-your-Strava-Account'>retain</a> publicly available segments or routes and other depersonalized geolocation information to continue to improve the Services, and we use aggregated information in Strava Metro and our Global Heatmap. This information will be de-associated from your name and other identifiers.</p>
