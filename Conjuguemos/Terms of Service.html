    <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">FERPA and Student Data</h4>

    <p class="mb-20">Certain information that may be provided to Conjuguemos by school personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution, may be considered an education record ("Education Record") under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). Additionally, certain information, provided to Conjuguemos by school personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA ("Directory Information") and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA ("FERPA Exemption(s)"), including the exemption for Directory Information ("Directory Information Exemption") or disclosure to school officials
         with a legitimate educational interest ("School Official Exemption").</p>
    <p class="mb-20">As school personnel or the Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Conjuguemos, you acknowledge,
         affirm and pledge to Conjuguemos, as applicable, that your Institution has:</p>

    <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Pricing, Billing and Cancellation</h4>
 <p class="mb-20">This section rules membership fees for the Conjuguemos Premium Teacher plan. Membership fees for the Conjuguemos Premium School plans and any other charges educational institutions, companies or organizations may incur in connection with their use of the Service, such as taxes, where applicable, and possible transaction fees, will be charged on a one-time payment in exchange for a one-year subscription ("Initial Term"), with a renewal option for successive one-year periods at the end of each year ("Renewal Term"), unless otherwise agreed in writing by Conjuguemos and the purchasing educational institution, company or organization. Premium School memberships will be subject to the terms set forth in the issued quotes and invoices. 
    Aspects not contemplated by said documents shall be ruled by these Terms of Service.</p>


 <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Payment Method</h4>

    and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods. </p>

 <p class="mb-20">We may change our subscription plans and the price of our Services from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to our subscription plans will apply to you no earlier than 30 days following
     notice to you. The last time prices were changed was in 2015. </p>


     <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Switching from Premium Teacher to Premium School</h4>
 <p class="mb-20">If your educational institution, company or organization upgrades to Premium School and grants you a license to use Conjuguemos in accordance with that plan, your subscription to the Premium Teacher plan will automatically be canceled at the end of the current month and your account will be integrated into the 
    Premium School plan purchased by your educational institution, company or organization.</p>


 <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Electronic Communications</h4>
 <p class="mb-20">We will send you information related to your billing (e.g., invoices and expiration notices)

SENT BY THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR AN AGENT AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON THE OWNER'S BEHALF."</p>
 <p class="mb-20">Conjuguemos may remove any allegedly infringing content without any liability to the infringing user. Conjuguemos will promptly terminate without notice any user's access to the Service where the user is a "repeat infringer" of copyrights. Conjuguemos, however, reserves the right to identify and terminate users under any circumstances it deems appropriate, including after 
    only a single instance of allegedly infringing behavior by that user.</p>

    <h4 class="fw--400 mb-20">Third-Party Integrations, Websites and User Interactions</h4>

We will post notice of material changes to this Agreement on this page and/or send you written notice via email (using the email address you provided upon signing up for the Services and thereafter verified). Changes will not apply retroactively and will only become effective when (a) you use the Service after you know about the change, or (b) thirty (30) days after they are posted (whichever is sooner). However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services following notice of the changes to the Agreement or Guidelines, constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms, policies or guidelines.
     IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE MODIFIED AGREEMENT, PLEASE DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
 <p class="mb-20">As stated in our Privacy Policy, Conjuguemos will not change how Education Records are used or shared under these Terms of 
    Service without advance notice and consent from the competent school or institution.</p>
 

    <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Termination</h4>
 <p class="mb-20">This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service. You may terminate your use of the Service or your account at any time by either accessing your account's settings page or by contacting us at support@conjuguemos.com. Parents and students should reach out to us through an authorized school official. The Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), at its sole discretion, and without warning or notice, which may result in the loss of information associated with your account. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, 
    ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>



 <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Dispute Resolution</h4>
 <p class="mb-20">(A) Generally: in the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, including any other Guidelines and future modifications, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and 
    the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
 <p class="mb-20">(B) Exceptions: notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court
     of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
     <p class="mb-20">(C) Arbitration: any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available 
        online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company.</p>
     <p class="mb-20">(D) Notice: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, 
        by electronic mail ("Notice"). The Company's address for Notice is:</p>
        <br>Conjuguemos
        <br> PO Box 86
        <br>Newton, MA 02456
        <br>United States of America

     <p class="mb-20">The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Provided that our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the greatest amount offered by the Company 
        in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.</p>
     <p class="mb-20">(E) Fees: in the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either 
        party made withi fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
     <p class="mb-20">(F) No Class Actions: you and the Company agree that each may bring 
        claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Furthermore, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p class="mb-20">(G) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of San Franscisco, 
            California, shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</p>

            <h4 class="fw--600 mb-20">Legal Disclaimers</h4>

    THIRD PARTY THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING OTHER USERS.</p>
    <p class="mb-20">IN NO EVENT WILL CONJUGUEMOS OR ITS SUCCESSORS, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, PARTNERS OR AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU IN THE AGGREGATE (FOR ALL POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY YOU) FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF ANY FEES YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID TO THE COMPANY FOR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS 
        PRIOR TO THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD 100).</p>
 <p class="mb-20">CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF YOU RESIDE IN SUCH A JURISDICTION, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
