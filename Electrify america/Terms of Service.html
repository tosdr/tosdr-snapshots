You agree not to upload, post, display, or transmit any Submission(s) if such Submission(s), or any part thereof, or the act of making the Submission(s) would be considered defamatory, abusive, violative of any intellectual property or other property or proprietary rights of any third party, or unlawful in any other way. Company is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or monitoring Your or another user’s Submissions, and encourages all of its users to use reasonable discretion and caution in evaluating or reviewing any Submission(s).

If You become aware of Submissions that violate these rules regarding acceptable behavior or content, You may contact Company as provided herein. </li><li><strong>Permission to Use Submissions. </strong> By using the Solution to transmit, provide, distribute, or display a Submission(s), You automatically grant Company and any current or future parents, subsidiaries, as well as any current or future corporations, business entities, trusts, commonly-owned corporations, as well as any other entity owning, owned by, controlling, controlled by or under common control or ownership of an entity (whether legally, beneficially, by agreement or through stock ownership or other equity interest, directly or indirectly) and their permitted successors and assigns (collectively, “Company and/or Associated Entities”), with or without attribution, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to itself or any other party to use, act upon, make, have manufactured, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, modify, publish, create derivative works from, distribute and display such Submission(s) (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate into other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content or information. You also acknowledge that such Submissions (in the form received or provided by You) are non-confidential for all purposes and that Company owes no obligation of confidentiality, attribution, or approval, and has no control over the extent to which any idea or information may be used by any other party or person. You will receive no compensation for any Submission(s) and hereby waive any right to enforce any intellectual property or proprietary right against Company and/or Associated Entities as a result of or on the basis of any use or exploitation of any Submission. </li><li><strong>Purchases and Subscriptions.</strong> The Solution may contain the option for You to subscribe to a payment plan, membership plan, discount plan (“Plan”), or purchase other related products and services. The applicable fees (and any applicable discounts, if available), the time period a Plan, renewal terms, and permitted payment methods (e.g., credit or debit) (collectively, “Plan Details”) will be specified through the Solution at the time You subscribe to the Plan. A Plan may include an automatic renewal feature, the terms of which are those stated through the Solution in the course of Your initial subscription to the Plan. Each subscription is final with respect to the time period purchased, and each purchase is final at the time of the purchase, with no refunds or credits provided except as otherwise stated in this TOU, indicated by Company in writing, or as may be required under applicable law. All transactions are void where prohibited by law and Company may request information in order to confirm the order and method of payment. Company reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the Solution or to terminate any plan that You have subscribed to if You fail to pay any amounts owed under this TOU when due. The Plan Details for a Plan You have purchased are considered part of this TOU. </li><li><strong>Payments through the Solution.</strong> The Solution may offer You the opportunity to provide payment information (“Payment Information”) in order to complete payment for a purchase or a subscription or to load funds to Your account (“Transaction”). You agree only to provide Payment Information that is accurate and that you have authority to use for Transactions, and you agree that by providing an item of Payment Information you will be representing that you have such authority and that the Payment Information is accurate. You agree that Company may execute payment for Transactions that You order by using Payment Information that You have provided, and you authorize Company to do so, until You direct Company, through the Solution, to discontinue use of particular Payment Information. You shall be responsible for payment of all taxes, tariffs, levies, or duties applicable to Your payment. All amounts loaded to Your account will be denominated in the currency of the United States, and all transactions listed through the Solution are denominated in U.S. dollars. </li><li><strong>Funds for Account Payments. </strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of Your Account information. You should not disclose Your Account information to anyone. If Your Account information is lost or stolen, anyone who obtains possession of either could use Your Account. You are responsible for all transactions on Your Account, including unauthorized transactions. <ul class="lower-latin margin-top"><li> Loading of Funds. The Solution may enable You to load funds to Your Account and to make payments for use of Chargers by means of debits to Your Account (“Account Payments”). Company reserves the right to discontinue the availability of Account Payments at any time, in its reasonable discretion; if Company chooses to discontinue Account Payments, it will refund You the amount in Your Account, in the manner of refunds set forth in paragraph 10(e) below. To make Account Payments, You must first load a minimum dollar value to Your Account. Company may in its sole discretion adjust the minimum dollar value from time to time, without notice to You, and if the minimum increases You will need to have the new minimum amount in Your Account to engage in Account Payments. Any value that You load to Your account is a prepayment for the goods and services that You may purchase from Company or the Plans to which You may subscribe through the Solution. While You may be required to provide Payment Information to enroll in the Solution, Company might not charge Your payment method until Your first attempt to pay for use of a Charger using an Account Payment, notwithstanding any applicable subscription fee. The value You load to Your account is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and does not earn interest. There may be a delay from the time You load value to when the value is available for Account Payments. </li><li> Reloading of Funds. If You are participating in the Account Payments feature, You will be able to load additional funds into Your Account, by specifying such loads through the Solution. Company may impose and may alter, in its reasonable discretion and without notice to You, limits on Your loading of funds to Your Account. Such restrictions may include, without limitation, limits on the number of times You may load funds during a given time period, limits on the dollar value of each load, limits on the total dollar value You may load during a given time period, or limits on the total amount in Your Account. </li><li> Automatic Reloads. To make Account Payments, You may be required to permit automatic reloads. If You permit automatic reloads, You will specify a reload amount and a reload trigger, within limits that Company may set for such figures. Company will reload Your account, using Your Payment Information, by the specified reload amount whenever the value in Your Account decreases below the reload trigger. You may change Your reload amount or Your reload trigger, with such limits as Company may set from time to time. Your requested changes may take up to 24 hours to go into effect. No automatic reload transaction can be refunded or reversed. You can cancel automatic reloading only by deleting Your account. </li><li> Transaction History. You are responsible for checking Your transaction history to ensure that Your transaction history and account balance are accurate. You can check Your transaction history and balance through the Solution. If You have questions regarding Your transaction history or balance, or if You wish to dispute any transaction, please call Customer Assistance at 1-833-632-2778. Company will review Your claim and make a reasonable determination whether to adjust Your Account in response. Company has no obligation to review or correct any error unless You provide notice of the claimed error within sixty (60) days of the date of the transaction in question. </li><li> Refunds. The amount in Your Account is not transferrable to any other Account or any other person. The amount You have loaded to Your Account cannot be refunded or returned to You until You close Your Account and cancel Your registration with the Solution. If You do close Your Account and cancel Your registration with the Solution, Company will return any value then held in Your Account. Company will make that refund to the payment method You used to load the funds. If such payment method is not available, Company will not be required to refund or return the funds by any other means. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Subscription Plans. </strong> The Solution may provide You the option to sign up for a monthly subscription plan that provides discounted pricing for use of the Network, for a monthly fee. The details of such discounts and the amount of the fee are set forth in the Plan Details. Company may change the Plan Details for any Plan, upon prior notice to You and an opportunity for You to decide whether to cancel or to renew Your Plan. Company may cancel a Plan, but Your Plan will continue through the end of the last time period for which You have paid. <ul class="lower-latin margin-top"><li> Automatic Renewal. Your subscription plan will continue month-to-month and automatically renew until terminated. You must cancel Your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's membership fee to Your payment method on file. </li><li> Payment. You will need to provide Company with Payment Information, and authorization to use the Payment Information for recurring subscription fees, in order to subscribe to a Plan. If You have signed up for Account Payments, Company will use the funds in Your Account for subscription payments, and then make automatic reloads into Your Account if necessary to refill Your Account to the specified minimum balance. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases, Your payment date may change, for example if Your payment method has not successfully settled or if Your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. You can find specific details on Your next payment date through the Solution by viewing your billing details. You authorize Company to charge any payment method associated to Your account in case Your primary payment method is declined or no longer available to Company for payment of Your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not cancel Your account, Company may suspend Your Plan until Company has successfully charged a valid payment method. </li><li> Cancellation. You can cancel or terminate Your Plan by using the appropriate options provided in the App, or by using the appropriate options provided on the Site. You must be logged into Your account to cancel a Plan using the App or the Site. <p> Company will not provide refunds or credits for subscription fees for any partial-month subscription periods. </p></li><li> Limitations. A Plan is non-transferable, and You are not permitted to allow any other person to use Your Plan. The sale, barter, transfer or assignment of any subscription plan benefits is strictly prohibited. Without limiting any other remedies, Company may suspend or terminate Your Plan if it suspects, in its reasonable discretion, that You or any other person has engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with Your Plan, including without limitation by providing personal information that is untrue, inaccurate or not current. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Payments for Charging.</strong> You agree to pay, for any occasion that You use a Charger, the cost determined for such use. The unit prices for Your use of a given Charger will be the unit prices stated on the face of the Charger, and applicable for the characteristics of Your charging session including the maximum charging rate, at the time You initiate a session using that Charger, less any discount applicable to Your use of the Charger such as from a subscription plan You have purchased (“Stated Prices”). Stated Prices may include, but are not limited to, a price per kilowatt-hour of energy delivered by the Charger; a price per minute of charging; and a price per minute that Your vehicle is connected in an idle, non-charging state (for example, idle fees). The cost of Your use of a Charger may also include applicable taxes added to the cost calculated from the Stated Prices, and may also include a fixed fee, stated on the face of the Charger at the time You initiate the session. You acknowledge that the information presented by the Charger governs the determination of the cost you will pay, and you agree not to rely on prices displayed for Chargers in the App or on the Site. For Chargers where Stated Prices can vary depending on the maximum charging rate for a session, You agree that the maximum charging rate is based on the maximum requested by Your vehicle. You acknowledge that the actual charging rate may vary during a session and that the highest rate achieved during a session may be lower than that maximum, due to factors such as vehicle capacity at start of charging, temperature, battery age, vehicle efficacy, vehicle usage, and power output of the charging station. </li><li> If You fail to pay any amount owed under this TOU when payment is due, You shall reimburse Company for all reasonable costs incurred (including reasonable attorney’s fees) in collecting past-due amounts. Unless otherwise specified in this TOU, all Your obligations with respect to the amounts due to Company under the TOU shall survive the expiration or termination of the TOU for any reason. </li><li><strong>Communications, and Updates. </strong> By creating an account or by providing Your phone number to Company, You agree to receive communications from Company including, but not limited to email, push notifications, and/or text messages. These communications may include charging session notifications and final receipts. These communications are part of Your relationship with Company and You receive them as part of Your use of the Solution or the Network. You therefore hereby acknowledge and agree that any such notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that Company sends to You electronically are compliant with any applicable law that requires Your consent for a given communication. Furthermore, You understand and agree that installation of the App permits the downloading of updates and upgrades for the purpose(s) of fixing product defects or providing enhancements.

However, You acknowledge that Your refusal of an update or upgrade may impact performance of the App, and Company reserves the right to terminate Your use of the App if You refuse an update that Company deems critical. </li><li><strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> You understand, acknowledge, and agree that the operation of certain areas of the Solution and the creation of an account may require or involve the submission, use, and dissemination of various personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, Your phone number, email address, and mailing address.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. <ol class="margin-top"><li> Except to the extent governed or preempted by federal law, this arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. </li><li> To the extent permitted by applicable law, and with the sole exception of a claim or counterclaim that You or Company litigates in a small-claims court or equivalent court, for any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between You and Company (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to Your Account, relating to Your use of the Solution or Your use of the Network, or relating to this TOU (or any related or prior agreement that You may have had with Company), You and Company agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in Virginia, or, in the alternative, may be conducted telephonically at Your request. </li><li> Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules as they are amended from time to time. If the AAA is unavailable, the arbitration will be administered by such other administrator as You and Company jointly agree, using the latest extant version of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. </li><li> You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, You are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend Your rights EXCEPT for matters that You file in small claims court in Your state or municipality within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in a court located in Virginia, and You hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts in Virginia for such purposes. You and Company each agree that such a request for such emergency equitable relief will not waive any rights to arbitrate under this TOU. </li><li> You and Company must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR COMPANY MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that You are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of Your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (d) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (e) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither You nor Company may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (f) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law, subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this TOU. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Enforcing Security on the Solution. </strong> Company reserves the right to view, monitor, and record activity on the Solution without notice or permission from You. Any information obtained by monitoring, reviewing, or recording is subject to review by law enforcement organizations in connection with investigation or prosecution of possible criminal or unlawful activity on the Solution as well as to disclosures required by or under applicable law or related government agency actions. Company will also comply with all court orders or subpoenas involving requests for such information. </li><li><strong>Injunctive Relief. </strong> You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this TOU, including, without limitation, with respect to unauthorized use of Company proprietary rights or assets, will cause irreparable injury to Company, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and Company would not have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that Company shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of Your obligations under any provision of this TOU. Accordingly, You hereby waive any requirement that Company post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Company to enforce any provision of this TOU. </li><li><strong>Term &amp; Termination. </strong>Company reserves the right at any time and on any grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraudulent or unlawful activity or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOU, to deny Your access to the Network, Solution or to any portion thereof in order to protect its name and goodwill, its business, and/or others. This TOU will also terminate automatically if You fail to comply with its terms and conditions, subject to the survival rights of certain provisions identified below. Such a termination will be effective without prior notice and may impact (and prohibit) submission of any information. You may also terminate this TOU at any time by notifying Company of such termination by email. Company may also terminate this TOU at any time, by providing You reasonable prior notice through email if You have provided an email address, or if You have not provided an email address by providing public notice on the Site. All applicable provisions of this TOU will survive termination, as identified below. If You consent to the TOU again through use of a Charger or by means of the Solution You will be consenting to the TOU in such form as is available at such time. Upon termination of this TOU for any reason, You must destroy all copies of any aspect of the Solution in Your possession. The provisions concerning Company’s proprietary rights, Submissions, disclaimers of warranty, limitations of liability, waiver and severability, entire agreement, injunctive relief, and governing law will survive the termination of this TOU for any reason. </li><li><strong>Waiver &amp; Severability. </strong>Failure to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. No waiver by Company of any right under this TOU will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If any part of this TOU is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this TOU shall continue in effect. </li><li><strong>Export Controls. </strong>You represent and warrant that You are not (a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You hereby agree that (i) You will comply with all applicable Sanctions and Export Control Laws, (ii) You are solely responsible for ensuring that the Solution is used, disclosed, and/or transported only in accordance with all applicable Sanctions and Export Control Laws, and (iii) You will not re-export or transfer the Solution, in any form, directly or indirectly, to any person or entity based in Cuba, Iran, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, or North Korea. </li><li><strong>Contact Information. </strong>If You have any questions about the Solution or this TOU, or You wish to provide a notice to Company under this TOU, please contact Electrify America at: <br><strong>Address</strong>: 1950 Opportunity Way, Suite 1500, Reston, VA 20190 <br><strong>Phone</strong>: 1-833-632-2778 <br><strong>Email</strong>: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf2f5fdf4dbfef7fef8efe9f2fde2faf6fee9f2f8fab5f8f4f6" class="link"> <span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="660f08000926030a030512140f001f070b03140f05074805090b">[email&#160;protected]</span> </a></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous. </strong> No joint venture, partnership, employment, affiliate, or agency relationship exists between You and Company as a result of this TOU or Your utilization of the Solution.
