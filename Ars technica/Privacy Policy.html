If you fit that description and posted content on a section of our Service that is directed to California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email at privacy_administration@condenast.com or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the content.</p></div></section></div><div id="opt-out-of-marketing-communications"><br/><section class="jsx-738a68fb90e38c13 max-w-titles mx-auto px-4 py-8 text-block-section"><div class="rich-text"><h1>7.
