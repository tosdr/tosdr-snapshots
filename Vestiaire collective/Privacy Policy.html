<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may include on our site, computer applications from third parties, which allow you to share content from our&nbsp; site with other people or to let these other people know your consultation or your opinion concerning a content&nbsp; of our Platform. This is notably the case of the "Share" and "Like" buttons from social networks such as&nbsp; "Facebook".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social network providing such an application button is likely to identify you thanks to this button, even if you&nbsp; did not use this button when visiting our site. Indeed, this type of application button may allow the social network&nbsp; concerned to track your browsing on our site, simply because your account with the social network concerned&nbsp; was activated on your terminal (open session) during your browsing on our site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have no control over the process used by these third parties to collect information relating to your browsing&nbsp; on our site and associated with the personal data they hold. We invite you to consult the privacy protection&nbsp; policies of these social networks in order to learn about the purposes for which they may use the browsing&nbsp; information they may collect through these application buttons, particularly for advertising purposes. These&nbsp; protection policies must allow you to exercise your choices with these social networks, in particular by&nbsp; configuring your user accounts for each of these networks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retention period: The retention period of the sharing cookies is determined by each social network but must&nbsp; not exceed 13 months.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequence in case of blocking: No consequence on the use of the Platform. However, deactivating these&nbsp; cookies will prevent any interaction with the network(s) concerned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>10. How is your personal data protected?</strong></p>

We pass on these obligations to our service providers and subcontractors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>11. Transfer of personal data outside the European Union</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) the destination countries provide an adequate level of protection for personal data recognized by the&nbsp; European Commission; or&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) appropriate safeguards have been adopted (for example, by signing, with the recipient, the standard&nbsp; contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or authorized by a supervisory authority).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the date of the update of the Policy, the non-EU countries concerned are: the United States of America,&nbsp; the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Madagascar, Australia, Israel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To facilitate your request, we ask you to write us from the email address you used to create your account on the&nbsp; Platform.

<p><strong>Important information on identity checks: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of doubt or to fight fraud, we may ask you for proof of&nbsp; identity, address, purchase/sale or bank card. We will tell you how to provide us with these documents so that&nbsp; only the information we strictly need is transmitted to us (e.g.: copy of the identity card in black and white,&nbsp; photograph of part of a document, etc.). Only the departments that need to see these documents will process&nbsp; your data. We only keep these documents for the time necessary to verify them and then delete them&nbsp; immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>
