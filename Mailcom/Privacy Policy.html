We may also offer loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card programs consistent with these rights or payments as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, or the retention of personal information.
<br><br>
<strong>How to Exercise Your Rights</strong>
<br>
The exercise of these rights and the access to the information provided will not lead to any discriminatory treatment, nor will it negatively affect the service. You may only make a personal information request twice in a 12-month period. We will respond within 45 days of receiving a personal information request.
<br><br>
In addition to the above mentioned and in response to the requirements of CCPA, it is our aim to extend the transparency of the information collected and shared with third parties, which is why on pages related to data protection, such as the "Privacy Policy" and/or "Data Collection", the information referred to encompasses the data processing of the past twelve months.

<strong>Collection and processing of personal information</strong>
<br>
We refer to the ‘Information we collect’ section above which provides details on the categories of personal information we collect and why. We use your personal information for the legitimate business purposes set out above. Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, the legal bases that we rely on for processing your personal information are (i) your consent, where we obtain such consent from you; (ii) contractual necessity, where processing of your personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party; (iii) our legal obligation, where processing is necessary for compliance with such legal obligation; (iv) vital interest, where processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of you or of another individual; (v) where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; or (vi) or a legitimate interest, where processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of your personal information.
<br><br>
<strong>Cross-border Transfers</strong>
<br>
Please note that this product is intended for an audience in the United States, and that the information is processed on servers located in the United States. The processing of the information therefore predominantly takes place in this territory. However, it is possible that your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the services you understand that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information. 
<br><br>
Some non-EEA countries are recognized under the UK GDPR and by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank">here</a>. For transfers of personal information from the UK and/or EEA to countries not considered adequate under the UK GDPR or by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted under the UK GDPR and by the European Commission to protect your personal information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us.
We have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your personal data to third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of the company, all assets or shares (including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings). Such third parties can include e.g. an acquiring company and its consultants.
<br><br>
<strong>Retention Periods</strong>
<br>
We only store your personal data as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for processing the personal data, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted in accordance with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) the duration of our business relationship with you (e.g. the period in which you maintain your account with us); (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records for a certain period of time before we can delete them), or (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</p></p>
