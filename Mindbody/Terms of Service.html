<div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><p>This Mindbody Consumer Agreement (the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is a legal agreement between you (including your heirs, assigns, and successors) (collectively, “<strong>you</strong>,” “<strong>your</strong>”) and MINDBODY, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “<strong>Mindbody</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) governing your use of Mindbody’s consumer web-based application and/or mobile applications (collectively, the “<strong>Mindbody App</strong>”). Please read this Agreement carefully. By clicking on the “I Accept” button, completing the registration process, and/or downloading, and/or using the Mindbody App, you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement; (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Mindbody; and (3) you have the authority to enter into this Agreement personally or on behalf of the company you have named as the user, and to bind that company to the Agreement. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE MINDBODY APP</strong>.</p><p><strong>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT SECTION 27 OF THIS AGREEMENT, BELOW, CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MINDBODY TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS.</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2 class="heading--delta">1. Mindbody App Registration and Account Activation.</h2><p>The Mindbody App allows you to create 1 universal consumer profile that enables you to perform aggregated searches, then schedule and pay for wellness services, including fitness, beauty, integrative health and other services offered by thousands of participating businesses and independent practitioners (“<strong>Mindbody Subscribers</strong>”).<br><br>The Mindbody App also enables you to synchronize any consumer accounts you have previously created with Mindbody Subscribers, so that you may view your history of purchases and visits with those providers, use any current series, membership, gift card or account credits you may have with those providers, and to renew or purchase additional services.</p><p>The Mindbody App, subject to these terms and payment of applicable fees, may also provide you with an opportunity to purchase a product which will allow you to view video on demand content and to participate in livestreamed fitness classes (“<strong>Flex</strong>”). For the purposes of this Agreement, Flex shall be considered part of the Mindbody App and references to the Mindbody App shall be read as including Flex when made available via the Mindbody App.</p><p>To make credit or debit card purchases from Mindbody or the Mindbody Subscribers, you must complete the registration and open an account within the Mindbody App (“<strong>Mindbody App Account</strong>”). You do this by providing your first and last name and email address, completing your email verification, and associating 1 or more valid credit or debit cards with that Mindbody App Account. You must provide accurate and up-to-date information. You are solely responsible for managing your Mindbody App Account. Your Mindbody App Account is non-transferrable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any third party. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Mindbody App Account if you provide inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information or if you attempt to use your Mindbody App Account to engage in illegal or unethical activities.</p><p>If you register for the Mindbody App through your Facebook account (“<strong>Facebook Account</strong>”), you are allowing Mindbody to access your Facebook Account as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of your Facebook Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Facebook Account login information to Mindbody and/or grant Mindbody access to your Facebook Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of your Facebook Account and without obligating Mindbody to pay any fees or making Mindbody subject to any usage limitations imposed by Facebook. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH FACEBOOK, AND MINDBODY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO US BY FACEBOOK IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2 class="heading--delta">2. Accepted Payment Methods.</h2><p>The Mindbody App allows you to make payments by those methods accepted by Mindbody and the Mindbody Subscribers. Typically, these are card-based methods, including cards bearing the trademarks of Visa Inc., MasterCard International Inc., Discover Inc., and/or American Express Inc. (collectively, the “<strong>Networks</strong>”). Please note that Mindbody and Mindbody Subscribers may not accept all payment methods, including all card-based payment methods. The Networks accepted by Mindbody and each Mindbody Subscriber are displayed in the Mindbody App. We are not a bank, and do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. We also do not offer money service business services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. You can associate with your Mindbody App Account any U.S.-issued and most non-U.S. issued credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo. Mindbody and Mindbody Subscribers may update at any time the list of card types that they accept and you may associate with your Mindbody App Account. You may not associate Health Savings Account cards with your Mindbody App Account, even if they have a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo on them.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2 class="heading--delta">3. Your Authorization for Purchases Made Through the Mindbody App.</h2><p>By associating a payment card with your Mindbody App Account, searching for and reserving services in the Mindbody App, and agreeing to pay for those services within the Mindbody App, you are authorizing a charge to your payment card as necessary to complete the purchase. In the event you are entitled to a reversal, refund, chargeback, or other adjustment associated with a purchase you made through the Mindbody App, you also authorize a credit to your payment card to accomplish that transaction.<br><br>Purchases you authorize through the Mindbody App may also be subject to terms and conditions set forth by the Networks and/or the entities that issue your card. You are responsible for complying with those terms and conditions, and you are responsible for charges and related fees and billing terms imposed by those terms and conditions as well as any fees and/or surcharges imposed by Mindbody or a Mindbody Subscriber.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>4. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers.</h2><p>Your Mindbody App Account permits you to make payments on a compatible mobile device. Devices modified contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to disabling hardware or software controls-sometimes referred to as “jailbreaking”, are not compatible mobile devices. You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Mindbody App is expressly prohibited, constitutes a violation of the terms of this Agreement, and is grounds for termination of your Mindbody App Account. Mindbody does not warrant that the Mindbody App will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier.</p><p>Your use of the Mindbody App may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>5. App Stores.</h2><p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mindbody App is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Mindbody App license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play ("<strong>App Store</strong>"). You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Mindbody and not with Apple, Google, or their App Stores. Mindbody, not Apple, Google, or their App Stores, is solely responsible for the Mindbody App, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Mindbody App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Mindbody App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Mindbody App is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the Mindbody App. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce them.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>6. Restrictions on Use.</h2><p>By using the Mindbody App, you represent, acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years of age, or if you are under 18 years of age but are at least 13 years old (a "<strong>Minor</strong>"), that you are using the Mindbody App with the consent of your parent or legal guardian and that you have received your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to use the Mindbody App and agree to this Agreement. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you hereby agree to bind the Minor to this Agreement and to fully indemnify and hold harmless Mindbody if the Minor breaches any of the terms of this Agreement. If you are not at least 13 years old, you may not use the Mindbody App at any time or in any manner or submit any information to the Mindbody App or Mindbody.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mindbody App and your Mindbody App Account may only be used in a country or territory where current Mindbody Subscribers exist and the laws of that country or territory permit its use. You may not export the Mindbody App directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Mindbody App may be subject to export restrictions imposed by U.S. law, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII).&nbsp;</p><p>By creating a Mindbody App Account, you also confirm that you will not make payments in connection with the following businesses or business activities: (1) any illegal activity; (2) credit counseling or repair agencies; (3) credit protection or identity theft protection services; (4) direct marketing or subscription offers or services; (5) infomercial sales; (6) internet/mail order/telephone order pharmacies or pharmacy referral services (where fulfillment of medication is performed with an internet or telephone consultation, absent a physical visit with a physician including re-importation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries); (7) multi-level marketing businesses; (8) inbound or outbound telemarketers; (9) prepaid phone cards or phone services; (10) rebate based businesses; (11) upsell merchants; (12) bill payment services; (13) betting, including lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, off-track betting, and wagers at races; (14) financial institutions offering manual or automated cash disbursements; (15) financial institutions offering merchandise and services; (16) sales of money orders or foreign currency by non-financial institutions; (17) wire transfer money orders; (18) high-risk merchants, including telemarketing merchants; (19) service station merchants; (20) automated fuel dispensers; (21) adult entertainment oriented products or services (in any medium, e.g., internet, telephone or printed material); (22) internet/mail order/telephone order firearm or weapon sales; (23) internet/mail order/telephone order cigarette or tobacco sales; (24) drug paraphernalia; (25) hate products; (26) escort services; and/or (27) bankruptcy attorneys.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>7. Mindbody Subscriber Loyalty Programs.</h2><p>Mindbody Subscribers may choose to offer loyalty programs to reward their customers. These loyalty programs may be linked to your Mindbody App Account. Any such loyalty programs and any rewards associated with them are offered by the Mindbody Subscriber alone (and not by Mindbody). Should you have questions about any Mindbody Subscriber loyalty program, please ask the Mindbody Subscriber for more information about the program, including any applicable terms and conditions. Rewards associated with Mindbody Subscriber loyalty programs have no cash value, and Mindbody Subscriber may choose to discontinue its loyalty program(s) at any time.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>8. Texting Features Consent.</h2><p>Mindbody may, from time to time, offer text message programs, including one-time texts and subscription text services, where Mindbody or a Mindbody Subscriber texts you for alerts, promotions and other purposes (“<strong>SMS Texting Services</strong>”). For more information on these services, please visit <a href="https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/sms-texting-terms">SMS Texting Terms and Conditions</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>To the extent you use any feature of the Mindbody App that enables you to send text message to device holders and you elect to use the feature, you acknowledge that Mindbody only provides a platform for you to send text messages through the Mindbody App and has no responsibility or liability for any such text messages or related message content. Your responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement will remain your sole responsibility and liability even if Mindbody offers advice or guidance regarding the text messages you transmit.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>9. Unauthorized or Illegal Transactions.</h2><p>We may decide not to process a transaction if we believe that the transaction is in violation of any Mindbody agreement or exposes you, other Mindbody users, our partners, including any Mindbody Subscribers, or Mindbody to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we reasonably suspect that your Mindbody App Account has been used for any unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Mindbody App Account, and/or any of your transactions with law enforcement.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>10. Mindbody App Purchase Information.</h2><p>By using the Mindbody App, you give Mindbody permission to share your email address, first and last name and purchase histories with the Mindbody Subscribers you make purchases with. You also give us permission to import into your Mindbody App Account and to share with Mindbody Subscribers information about purchases you have made using your payment card and any of Mindbody’s products or services. More information can be found in the Mindbody Privacy Policy.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>11. Your Privacy.</h2><p>Our privacy policy governs how we collect and use personal information that is submitted through our apps and services. Upon agreeing to be bound by this Agreement you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted Mindbody’s <a href="https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> located at <a href="https://company.mindbodyonline.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>12. Customer Service Disclaimer.</h2><p>You understand and agree that Mindbody is not responsible for the goods and services that you purchase through the Mindbody App. Third-party merchants, including Mindbody Subscribers, and not Mindbody, provide those goods and services. These merchants, and not Mindbody, are responsible for customer service related to those goods and services, including the nature, content and quality of the class or appointment, and reservation, cancellation, return and refund policies, adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and issues concerning experiences with a merchant’s personnel, policies, or processes. The Networks and/or other entity issuing your payment card, and not Mindbody, is responsible for customer service related to your payment card.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>13. Disclosures and Notices.</h2><p>You acknowledge and agree that Mindbody may provide disclosures and other notices required by law and other information about your Mindbody App Account to you electronically by posting them on the Mindbody App or by emailing the email address listed in your Mindbody App Account. You also agree that electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. You are responsible for providing Mindbody with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Mindbody is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by this Agreement, Mindbody’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>14.

Further, you understand and agree that such livestreamed classes, including video and/or audio of your participation in the same, may be recorded and offered as a video on demand content. Accordingly, your participation and the video and/or audio recording of the same will be “<strong>User Content</strong>” subject to the licenses granted below.&nbsp;</p><p>For any User Content that you upload to the Mindbody App, you grant us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable, and sublicensable right and license to use, license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, prepare derivative works of, distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from, and communicate to the public, perform, and display that User Content (in whole or in part) throughout the world in any media in order to provide and promote the Mindbody App and Mindbody’s business.

License Grant to You.</h2><p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Mindbody hereby grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of the Mindbody App on a single mobile device that you own or control and to run such copy of the Mindbody App solely to find and reserve services and make purchases from Mindbody Subscribers in accordance with this Agreement.

Arbitration Agreement.</h2><p><em><strong>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Mindbody and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong></em></p><p><strong>27.1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </strong>If a dispute of any kind arises with a Mindbody Subscriber, you agree to resolve that dispute with the applicable Mindbody Subscriber. For any dispute that you have with Mindbody, we will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. If those efforts fail, by using the Mindbody App, you agree that ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND MINDBODY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED PURSUANT TO THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE WILL BE RESOLVED by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you or Mindbody may assert claims in small claims court if the claims qualify; and (ii) you or Mindbody may seek relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior to this version of this Agreement</strong>.</p><p><strong>27.2. Arbitration Rules and Forum. </strong>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CT Corporation System, 818 West Seventh Street, Suite 930, Los Angeles, CA 90017. The CT Corp office in your jurisdiction may be located through the Secretary of State’s website. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Mindbody will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Mindbody will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p><p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America. You and Mindbody further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the county of San Luis Obispo, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.3. Authority of Arbitrator. </strong>The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and shall have exclusive authority to (1) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (2) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Mindbody. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp; The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.4. Waiver of Jury Trial. </strong>YOU AND MINDBODY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Mindbody are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27.1, above.&nbsp; An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.5. Waiver of Class Actions or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Mindbody, Attention: MB App Arbitration Opt Out, 651 Tank Farm Road, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 or at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b8b1b3b5b894b9bdbab0b6bbb0adbbbab8bdbab1fab7bbb9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6e020b090f022e0307000a0c010a1701000207000b400d0103">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.7. Severability.</strong> Except as provided in subsection 27.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.8. Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Mindbody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27.9. Modification.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Mindbody makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within 30 days of such change becoming effective by writing Company at the following address: Mindbody, Attention: MB App Arbitration Opt Out, 651 Tank Farm Road, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 or at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4a8a1a3a5a884a9adaaa0a6aba0bdabaaa8adaaa1eaa7aba9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8be7eeeceae7cbe6e2e5efe9e4eff2e4e5e7e2e5eea5e8e4e6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Modifications to this Arbitration Agreement will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the 30th day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Modification" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the Arbitration Agreement and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration Agreement in existence after you began using the Mindbody App.</p></div><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--paragraph-long-formatted-text paragraph--view-mode--default"><h2>28.
