The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations, including the time limitation agreed to under these Terms of Use.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing and shall be final. Judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification or appeal, except to the extent permitted by Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which Sections the parties agree shall apply. The expenses of arbitration, including and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the AAA, shall be shared equally by the parties.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>The arbitrator will have no authority to award attorneys’ fees, punitive damages, or any other monetary relief not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The award may include equitable relief. The arbitrator will not make any ruling, finding, or award that does not otherwise conform to the Terms. The arbitrator may render a summary disposition relative to all or some of the issues, provided that the responding party has had an adequate opportunity to respond to any such application for such disposition.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>The parties agree to treat all aspects of the arbitration as confidential, as provided in the AAA Rules. Before making any disclosure permitted by the Rules, a party shall give written notice to the other party and afford such party a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests.</p>

<p><u><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong></u>
	<br>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. You agree that neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under these Terms or any disputes between the parties. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. This provision shall not be construed as a waiver of your right to seek public injunctive relief as provided under California law to the extent such right may otherwise be available to you.</p>

<p><u><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong></u>
	<br>Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right we or you may have to a trial by jury for any legal action arising out of or relating to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby. This means that a judge rather than a jury will decide disputes between you and Mathnasium if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>

<p><strong>19. Equal Opportunity.</strong>
	<br>Mathnasium conducts our business on an equal opportunity basis. We do not discriminate in any manner prohibited by law.</p>

<p><strong>20. Headings.</strong>
	<br>Headings in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not control, limit, amplify or otherwise modify or affect these Terms of Use or the meaning and construction of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use are to be interpreted according to their fair meanings, and not strictly in favor of or strictly against either you or us.</p>

<p><strong>21. Assignment.</strong>
	<br>Mathnasium may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of Mathnasium.</p>

<p><strong>22. Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver.</strong>
	<br>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Mathnasium and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Mathnasium. If any provisions of these Terms of Use is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed removed and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, (a) no failure or delay by Mathnasium in exercising any of the rights, powers, or remedies hereunder will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (b) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by Mathnasium.</p>

<p><strong>23. Contact Us.</strong></p>
