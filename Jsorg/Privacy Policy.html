Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li></ul><p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data

These communications are
displayed in the form of banners and other advertisements on JS.ORG, possibly based on User interests.<br>This
does not mean that all Personal Data are used for this purpose. Information and conditions of use are shown below.<br>Some of the services listed below may use Trackers to identify Users or they may use the behavioral
retargeting technique, i.e. displaying ads tailored to the User’s interests and behavior, including those detected
outside JS.ORG. For more information, please check the privacy policies of the relevant services.<br>Services of
this kind usually offer the possibility to opt out of such tracking. In addition to any opt-out feature offered by
