<p>As part of our mission to spread good vibes, we want you to be able to share the things that matter to you most with your friends, family and anyone else around you. Itâs important to us that you feel comfortable and trust us with your data when using the Viber Services (as detailed under <span style="color: #5f44d2;"><a style="color: #5f44d2;" href="https://www.viber.com/en/terms/viber-terms-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Viber&#8217;s Terms of Service</strong></a></span>), including Viber payment services (if you use it). Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy, so that you understand what data we collect, what we do with it and why, how we protect it and what are your rights in relation to this data.</p>
<p>In general, we collect data that allows us to provide you with an optimal experience while using our Services. This includes, for example, some basic benefits like allowing other users to see the name and picture you choose to show and the more advanced ones, like processing your registration and financial data to allow you to purchase our paid solutions, if you choose to use them. It also helps us to keep our Services clear of fraud and spam, and it allows us to get a unique understanding of what additional services may be useful to you, in addition to other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Starting with Viber 6.0, Viberâs core features are secured with end-to-end encryption: Viber one-on-one calls, one-on-one messages, group messages, private media sharing and linked devices. This means that the encryption keys are stored only on your devices and no one, not even Viber itself, has access to them. To learn more about Viber Encryption, follow this link: <span style="color: #5f44d2;"><a style="color: #5f44d2;" href="http://www.viber.com/en/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>http://www.viber.com/en/security</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #5f44d2;">At Viber, we take information security seriously and have strict security measures in place to ensure that your account and your personal data are safe. Here you can find information regarding the security measures we have in place.</span></p>
<p>We implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the personal data we process. These measures are aimed at ensuring the ongoing integrity and confidentiality of personal data. We evaluate these measures on a regular basis to ensure the security of the processing. To learn more about our security measures, follow this link: <span style="color: #5f44d2;"><a style="color: #5f44d2;" href="http://www.viber.com/en/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>http://www.viber.com/en/security</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #5f44d2;">Our App may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third-party website. We may also allow certain functionalities through third-party services. We are not responsible for the data collection by such third parties, and their privacy practices and polices shall govern your personal data processed by them. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5f44d2;"><strong>Third parties&#8217; websites, apps and services: </strong></span></p>
<p>If you access our Services and App from any third-party website, service or other digital source, or access any third-party site or service from our Services and App, note that, your use and the personal data collected by such third parties or provided by you in connection therewith will be subject to such third party&#8217;s practices and we do not monitor, nor are responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.</p>
<p>We use the Google Maps API for some functions of the App, therefore the Google privacy policy<span style="color: #5f44d2;"><strong> <a style="color: #5f44d2;" href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a></strong></span> is incorporated herein.</p>
<p><span style="color: #5f44d2;"><strong>Back-ups:</strong></span></p>
<p>If you voluntarily choose to back up your Viber conversations, such back-ups are made by independent third parties and kept on your deviceâs service according to operating systemâs (Google/ iOS) terms and policies and are no longer protected by Viberâs end-to-end encryption nor Viber has any control over it. This is also true for using Viber Desktop &#8211; where your conversations are kept on your personal computer under your security definitions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #5f44d2;"><strong>TrueDepth APIs:</strong></span></p>
<p>Starting the end of June 2021 we added a new face lens feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the userâs face. Some lenses can make use of TrueDepth API. TrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running. It is a very specific feature and none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment. Types of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on, which we donât have. Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere. The data never leaves the userâs device (so cannot be, and is not, shared by Viber with third parties) and is only used for lens operation.</p>
