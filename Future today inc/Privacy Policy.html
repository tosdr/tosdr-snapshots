                            The GDPR and other applicable data protection laws require that we have a valid reason to use your Personal Data. This is called the “lawful basis for processing.” We may process your Personal Data:

                                <li>Because you gave your consent.</li>

                                <li>Because we have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Data and it is not overridden by your rights. Some of those interests include:

                            Where we process your or your child’s Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect the validity of our processing of Personal Data performed on other lawful grounds.<br>
                            Where we receive your Personal Data as part of the provision of the Service to/from you or your brand to fulfil a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide the Service to you or fulfill our contractual obligations with you.

                            We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which we collected your Personal Data and any other permitted linked purpose and in compliance with our data retention policies. For example, we will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.<br>

                            Generally, we retain usage data for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.<br>

                            If your Personal Data is used for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the longest retention period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter retention period once that period expires. Our retention periods are also based on our business needs and good practice.
