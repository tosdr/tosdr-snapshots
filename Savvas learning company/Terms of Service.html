                        We are concerned about the safety and privacy of all users of the Service, particularly children. Please read our
						<a href="privacy/corporate/privacy/learning-services-privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, which is an important part of these Terms of Use.
                        </p><br />

                        <p align ="justify"><strong>CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF USE</strong><br /></br>
						We may make additions, deletions or modifications to these Terms of Use, including the <a href="privacy/corporate/privacy/learning-services-privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, from time to time. Such additions, deletions or modifications shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any means including, but not limited to, posting within the Service, or by electronic or conventional mail, messaging, or by any other means by which you may obtain notice of such additions, deletions or modifications.

                        <p align ="justify"><strong>AUTHORIZED USER LICENSE</strong><br /></br>
                        You must be an Authorized User to use the Service. An “Authorized User” shall mean a student, faculty member, school employee, board member or other individual who has gained lawful access to the Service (and such access has not been terminated) either directly from the Company or its authorized agent, or from a Licensed Customer. In addition to any other requirements specified in these Terms of Use, the use of the Service requires that you create a user account (“User Account”), which generally requires choosing a unique user name and password and providing certain registration information. You agree to provide accurate and truthful information when creating a User Account. In the case of a classroom, school or school district, the teacher or administrator must create User Accounts on behalf of the students if the students are under the age of thirteen (13), and a unique user name and password will need to be distributed to each student by the teacher or administrator. No Authorized User may self- register for the Service if the user is under the age of thirteen (13). User Accounts are for your personal use only; provided that in certain circumstances, such as an account created for demonstration or evaluation purposes specifically intended for use by multiple individuals, account credentials may be shared.
                        </p>

                        <p align ="justify">If you are not an Authorized User, you may not use the Service, and any such use shall be a violation of these Terms of Use. Authorized Users are granted, subject to these Terms of Use, a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non- assignable, and non-transferable license to access and use the Service and the Materials for their personal, non- commercial, educational, instructional and related administrative purposes only. The Service, the Materials and any supporting software are the property of the Company and its licensors, and are protected by U.S. and international copyright and other intellectual property laws. The reproduction, redistribution, modification or publication of any part of the Service or the Materials, except as specifically permitted herein or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, is prohibited.</p>

						<p align ="justify">Certain Materials made available within the Service, such as worksheets, are designed to enable you to print and/or download such Materials for use with Authorized Users of your Licensed Customer. In addition, the Realize Reader app is an eBook application that allows downloading of certain Materials to your device so that you may access such Materials with or without an Internet connection. You may not, however, download Materials in order to store such Materials in a learning management system or other environment not provided or authorized by the Company, to distribute such Materials to anyone who is not an Authorized User of your Licensed Customer, or to archive such Materials for use beyond the length of your Licensed Customer’s subscription. You may print Materials only for use by Authorized Users of your Licensed Customer. To the extent that these Terms of Use authorize you to print or download any Materials, you shall make no changes to or deletion of author attribution, trademark legends, or copyright or other proprietary notices. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Service or any Materials. If you were provided access to the Service for demonstration or evaluation purposes, you may not use any Materials other than for purposes of the demonstration or evaluation.</p>

                        <p align ="justify">You may not modify, adapt or reverse engineer the Service or any Materials provided via the Service, and any attempt to do so is a violation of the Company’s and/or its licensors’ rights.

						<p align ="justify">Neither the Company nor its licensors guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any Materials. Authorized Users must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Materials, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Materials. Please note that we are continuously improving the Service, and may modify or adapt the Service at any time without any notice or obligation to you, at our sole discretion.</p>
                        <br />

						<p align ="justify"><strong>TERMINATION</strong><br /></br>
						Your right to access the Service is dependent upon your Licensed Customer maintaining an active subscription to the Service. If that subscription expires or is terminated, your access to the Service will terminate. In addition, the Company reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service at any time if you violate these Terms of Use or cease to be an Authorized User. Your Licensed Customer may also terminate your access to the Service in its discretion. Neither the Company nor its licensors will have any liability to you whatsoever in the event of any such termination of your access to the Service. Upon termination of your right to use the Service, you must cease all access to the Service. All provisions of these Terms of Use as to disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, and the Company’s or its licensors’ ownership rights shall survive termination of your access to the Service.</p><br />

Additionally, the Service may provide links to other third party websites or resources. Because the Company does not control your school's intranet site or such other third party websites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible or liable for the content, products or performance of your school's intranet site or such other third party websites and resources, and you hereby waive any claim against the Company with respect to your school's intranet site or such other websites and resources.

We recommend that you review any terms of use and privacy policy of your school's intranet site and any third party website linked to the Service before providing any information to those websites or using their products and services.</p>

These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and the Company will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of the Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or such claim or cause of action shall be forever barred.
