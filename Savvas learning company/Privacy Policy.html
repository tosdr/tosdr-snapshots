								<a name="policyOverview"></a>A. Policy Overview
							</h2>

							<p>This privacy policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot; or &quot;Policy&quot;) describes how
								Savvas Learning Company LLC (the &quot;Company,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our&quot; or
								&quot;us&quot;), collects, protects, uses
								and shares personal information gathered from Users of our websites, applications,
								products and services (&quot;Educational Service(s)&quot;, or &quot;Service(s)&quot;)
								that link to this Privacy Policy. It is important to us that educational institutions or
								individuals who have purchased and are using our Educational Services
								(&quot;Customers&quot;, or &quot;you&quot;) understand the measures we have taken to
								keep our Services a safe and trustworthy environment for all Users.</p>

							<p>Although Sections C, D, and E of this Privacy Policy provide detailed information on our
								collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, we would like to highlight
								the following:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>We will NEVER sell your Student Data to third parties.</li>
								<li>We will NEVER perform targeted advertising of your Student Users.</li>
								<li>We will NEVER share your Student Data with third parties for the purpose of targeted
									advertising.</li>
								<li>We will NEVER build marketing profiles of your Student Users.</li>
								<li>We will NEVER claim ownership of your Student Data.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

							<p>We encourage you to read through and understand this Privacy Policy. From time to time,
								we may update it to address new issues or reflect changes to our Services. If we are
								making updates that involve material changes to the collection, protection, use or
								disclosure of Personal Information, we will attempt to provide you with advanced notice
								of the revisions. This notice may occur through various methods depending on which
								will best allow us to reach affected customers. These methods may include, but are not
								limited to, e-mail, postal mail, or a conspicuously-posted website notice. Depending on
								the method that is used, we may also provide Users of the Service with advance notice of
								material changes, however, Customers who are educational institutions should ensure that
								they keep students, parents, and other stakeholders informed of any material changes, as
								data handling practices can vary based on school-specific configurations and requests.
								Please feel free to contact us if you have questions or concerns regarding intended
								Privacy Policy revisions.</p>

							<p>In accordance with our commitment to provide notice as described above, we reserve the
								right to revise the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any such revisions to this Policy are
								effective immediately upon posting of a revised Policy. Your use of the Services
								subsequent to such posting constitutes your acceptance of such revisions.</p>

								<a name="personalInfoWeCollect"></a>C. Personal Information We Collect
							</h2>

							<p>We collect information about Users of the Service in multiple ways, including Personal
								Information provided directly to us by a Customer for upload to the Service, data
								collected directly from or generated by Student and Educator Users of the Service, and
								data generated through your use of the Service. Depending on the Services provided, we
								may also collect Personal Information through other methods that follow the terms
								of this Privacy Policy.</p>

							<h3>Personal Information Input by Customers</h3>

							<p>When a Customer contracts with us to provide an Educational Service, initial setup and
								configuration of that Service, in most cases, will involve an initial transfer of
								Personal Information by the Customer. In addition, some of our products allow our
								customers to input certain optional demographic or other identifying data (student
								email address, date of birth, etc.) if such information is useful for the district&#39;s
								educational purposes.  These fields do not need to be populated to use our products,
								but if the district supplies any of this data, it will be treated in accordance with
								this Policy. The following tables contain information about
								elements of Student and Educator Data commonly collected from our Customers
								(as applicable). Although we do attempt to maintain the accuracy of these tables,
								data handling practices may vary significantly across our K-12 products.</p>

							<h3>Service-Generated Data</h3>

							<p>The Service you have purchased may generate information tied to specific Users as a core
								part of its functionality, such as for adaptive learning or providing immediate feedback
								to students. Service-generated data may also include the automatic generation of
								usernames or other data elements tied to a specific User, where those elements are not
								provided or set by the Customer.</p>

							<h3>Cookies and Related Technologies</h3>

							<p>Our Services use cookies to enable you to sign-in to the Service and access your stored
								preferences and settings. You have a variety of tools to control the use of cookies, web
								beacons, and similar technologies, including browser controls to block and delete
								cookies. If you choose to disable or block these technologies, it may prevent or impair
								required functionality and therefore your use of the Service.</p>

							<h3>Application and System Logs</h3>

							<p>Application and system logs are critical to ensuring the availability and security of the
								Service. We collect log data for such purposes as monitoring the health of the Service,
								detecting unauthorized access and fraudulent activity on the Service, preventing and
								responding to Service-related security incidents, and ensuring appropriate scaling of
								the Service&#39;s computing resources.</p>

							<h3>Do Not Track Disclosures</h3>

							<p>Do Not Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) is a proposed mechanism for allowing website visitors to
								control the collection of certain Usage Data. Although there has been research into the
								development of a standard to support the use of DNT signals, there is no adopted
								standard to follow. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, but we are
								closely monitoring DNT proposals for further developments.</p>

							<h3>Third-Party Collection</h3>

							<p>Although we may use third-party vendors, subcontractors, and service providers to assist
								us in providing the Service, we do not permit third-party ad networks or similar
								services to collect the Personal Information of our authenticated Users.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="color-default text-default parbase section text">
							<h2>
								<a name="howWeUsePersonalInfo"></a>D. How We Use Personal Information
							</h2>

							<p>We use your Personal Information for educational purposes and to exercise our legal
								rights, as described below.</p>

							<h3>Educational Uses</h3>

							<p>We use Personal Information to provide you with the Service(s) requested. We may use your
								Personal Information for any purposes required or permitted under our Agreement or with
								your consent.</p>

							<h3>Legal and Safety Uses</h3>

							<p>We may use your Personal Information to protect or exercise our legal rights, to defend
								against claims, to investigate fraud and other criminal conduct, to enforce our Terms of
								Service, to respond to a government request, to protect the security, integrity and
								availability of the Service, or to otherwise protect the property and safety of the
								Company, our Users, and others.</p>

							<h3>De-Identified and Aggregate Data</h3>

							<p>Customer data no longer needed for the delivery of our services shall either be deleted
								or de-identified and aggregated. We may use Usage Data and other properly de-identified
								or aggregate data to improve existing products, develop new products, communicate
								product effectiveness and outcomes, and for other related purposes. Our methods for
								de-identification are informed by guidance from the National Institute of Standards and
								Technology (NIST), the U.S. Department of Education's Privacy Technical Assistance
								Center, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Unless required to do so by
								law, we will not attempt to re-identify de-identified data and, where feasible and
								appropriate, will not transfer de-identified data to a third party unless they also
								agree not to attempt re-identification.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="color-default text-default parbase section text">
							<h2>
								<a name="howWeSharePersonalInfo"></a>E. How We Share Personal Information
							</h2>

							<p>We share your Personal Information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing
								Educational Services to you and to exercise our legal rights, as described below.</p>

							<h3>Subcontractors</h3>

							<p>Depending on the Service, we may hire subcontractors, vendors or other third parties to
								help deliver or improve the Service. Third-parties that we work with who have access to
								your Personal Information are subject to stringent privacy and security contractual
								requirements equivalent to those set forth in this Policy, including, but not limited
								to, deletion, de-identification and prohibitions on collection, use or disclosure of
								Personal Information for non-educational purposes and maintenance of a comprehensive
								information security program. </p>

							<h3>Merger, Acquisition or Bankruptcy</h3>

							<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets,
								we may need to share your Personal Information with the acquiring entity. We will
								condition any merger, acquisition, or sale on continued adherence to the terms of this
								Policy and maintaining a materially similar level of protection for your Personal
								Information. If such an event occurs, we will provide you information about the coming
								change, how it may impact you and any choices you may have.</p>

							<h3>Legal and Safety Disclosures</h3>

							<p>We may disclose your Personal Information when it is required or permitted by law, such
								as to comply with a subpoena, court order or similar legal process, to protect or
								exercise our legal rights, to defend against claims, to investigate fraud and other
								criminal conduct, to enforce our Terms of Service, to respond to a government request,
								to protect the security, integrity and availability of the Service, or to otherwise
								protect the property and safety of the Company, our Users, and others.</p>

							<h3>Data Ownership and Access Requests</h3>

							<p>Customers who are educational institutions have primary responsibility for fulfilling
								student and parent access, amendment, and export requests. In most cases, Customers can
								fulfill these requests using the built-in functionality of the Service. Where this
								functionality is not available or the Customer cannot otherwise fulfill the request on
								their own, we will provide reasonable assistance with the production or export of
								Student Data if the assistance is in accordance with our Agreement and applicable law.
								In rare cases, we may not be able to fully satisfy these requests. Examples include
								requests for confidential company information in addition to Student Data, requests for
								Student Data in a specific or proprietary format that we are unable to support, or
								requests that are prohibited by law.</p>

							<h2>
								<a name="security"></a>F. Security
							</h2>

							<p>We store and process Customer Personal Information in accordance with industry standards
								and applicable law. Our comprehensive information security program protects your
								Personal Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure through the use of
								reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards. We perform
								periodic risk assessments of our information security program and prioritize remediation
								of identified security vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, security is a shared
								responsibility and no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of
								electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security
								of your Personal Information.</p>

							<p>If you have general questions for us regarding the security and confidentiality of your
								Personal Information, please feel free to contact us using the information in Section
								B above.</p>

							<h3>Breach Notification</h3>

							<p>In the event of a security incident affecting our systems that involves your Personal
								Information, we will notify you as required by applicable law and the terms of our
								Agreement. We will always attempt to notify you of any security incident affecting your
								Personal Information that we believe poses a material risk of harm to you, your staff or
								your students.</p>

							<h3>Federation and Identity Management Support</h3>

							<p>We strongly support and encourage the use of secure federated identity management
								technologies such as SAML in conjunction with our Services. These technologies make
								access to our Service safer and more secure for your district and Users.</p>

							<h3>Use, Retention and Deletion</h3>

							<p>We do not collect, maintain, use, or share Personal Information beyond what is required
								for the educational purposes for which it was collected and will retain (where
								required), destroy or de-identify your Personal Information in accordance with
								applicable law and the terms of our Agreement. Deletion and retention functionality and
								procedures vary based on the Service used.</p>

								limited to, (i) securely configuring your accounts using federated identity management
								or strong and unique passwords and not sharing your authentication information, (ii)
								avoiding the upload of unnecessary Personal Information into the Service, (iii)
								exercising oversight to ensure your Educator and Student Users are using the Service

							<h3>External Content</h3>

							<p>Certain Services we offer may link, or provide Users with the ability to link, to
								external content such as online videos or news articles. Educator Users often make these
								sites available as reading materials for Student User assignments or exercises. We urge
								our Customers and Educator Users to exercise caution by evaluating the privacy practices
								of external sites you are linking to, particularly those that collect Personal
								Information from your Student Users.</p>

							<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any non-Company site, as we are unable to control
								the associated privacy and security practices. However, in the case of third-party
								content providers to which we provide any Personal Information to facilitate the
								provision of Services to you, we have evaluated such third parties&#39; data handling
								practices to ensure that they protect your Personal Information in accordance with this
								Privacy Policy. Should you have concerns over the privacy practices of our linked or

								and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. &sect; 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99). We receive Student
								Data from Customers who are educational institutions as a &quot;school official&quot;
								under FERPA and only process Student Data for educational purposes. In the event we
								receive a subpoena or judicial order for the disclosure of education records, we will
								notify the associated institutional Customer(s) prior to fulfilling the request in
								accordance with FERPA. For additional information on FERPA, please visit the U.S.
