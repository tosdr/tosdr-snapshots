    5. When We Disclose Information to Third Parties
  </h1>

  <p>Information collected from Users will not be disclosed except for the following purposes, which include our operations purposes:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>To service providers such as payment processors, financial institutions, technological, analytical, marketing, advertising service providers and partners and third party professional advisors (i.e., auditors, law firms, etc.), provided that, the service providers agree to keep the information confidential.</li>

    <li>To our affiliates and business partners and their employees for business purposes, when necessary for the purpose of the provision of our services or when such affiliates provide services to us.</li>

    <li>As needed to conduct our competitive events and to prevent, detect and investigate violations of our Fair Play Policy, Competitive Events Policy and the rules of any competitive event organized by us.</li>

    <li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate as set forth above in Other Uses and Disclosures.</li>

    <li>With government bodies and law enforcement or where we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If required or permitted to do so under the law, and if deemed necessary or warranted, we may provide notice to Users prior to the disclosure.</li>

    <li>Subject to confidentiality agreements, the terms of this Policy, and applicable law, information may be disclosed to service providers, advisers, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we or any of our affiliates are acquired by or merged with another company, or we sell, liquidate, transfer, or license all or a portion of our assets in bankruptcy or otherwise. This means that if some or all our assets are acquired or otherwise transferred or licensed, including in bankruptcy, that such acquirer shall be subject to the same commitments stated under this Policy.</li>

    <li>We may use third-party advertising networks and other affiliates in association with cookies, pixel tags, IFrames or similar technologies to: (1) deliver interest-based advertising to those Users, including our advertising, when those Users visit third-party websites; and (2) provide us with statistics about the effectiveness of our advertising on third-party websites. These third-party advertising networks may use this cookie information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>

    <li>To a third-party that uses or supports referral links to our Services only if you click on a referral link.</li>

    <li>Any third-party where such disclosure is required in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service or other relevant agreements.</li>

    <li>Any third-party if necessary to protect the rights, property, integrity or security of our company, our customers, or others (including, without limitation, you).</li>

  </ul>

  <p>For service efficiency purposes, some of these affiliates and third parties are located in territories outside the EU/EEA, and from time to time we may transfer your personal data to a third country not being approved by the European Commission as a safe country for such transfer (adequacy decision). If you are a EU/EEA resident and whenever applicable we will use the Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure an equivalent level of protection as granted within the EU/EEA or other lawful grounds for carrying out said transfer.</p>

  </h1>

  <p>Any User can review or change the information they provided when they registered for the Services by updating the information on their Account profile or by contacting us at <a href='mailto:Support@chess.com' target='_blank'>support@chess.com</a>. You also can exercise your right of access by requesting it on the “<a href='https://www.chess.com/my-data' target='_blank'>My data</a>“ Section of our Services. In addition, Users may contact us at any time as described in Section “Contact Us“ below, to request that we provide for their review any PI they have provided, or to cease collecting PI from the User.</p>

  <p>When we change any PI at your request, we will make reasonable efforts to make the changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable and always within the applicable legal term. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules.</p>

    7. How to Exercise your Rights to Cancel and Delete your Account and How to Request Reactivation
  </h1>

  <p>Users may cancel their Accounts at any time by using the “<a href='https://www.chess.com/settings/manage-account' target='_blank'>Manage Account</a>“ section in the settings or by contacting support@chess.com.</p>

  <p>Please bear in mind that after an Account is canceled, the PI and other Account information is not deleted permanently. We store the User information to allow the User to reopen their Account at any time. However, we provide no guarantee, and shall have no liability or obligation to ensure, that all Account Information and Services-related progress will be available or accessible or all learning or personalization features will be able to be recovered or resumed.</p>

  <p>Upon Account cancellation or execution of a deletion request (as explained below), anonymized User information may nonetheless persist internally in our backup, archive files or similar databases, and may still be used anonymized, for our internal support, administrative, and record-keeping purposes including, but not limited to, allowing us to improve the Services and other services we provide through research, evaluation, and analytics as permissible by applicable law and for other purposes specifically outlined in this Policy. We may also keep certain information in backup or archive records if required by law or if it is relevant to preventing fraud or future violations of our policies or for legitimate business purposes when permitted by applicable law. All retained data will continue to be subject to our Policy in effect at that time</p>

  <p>Following cancellation of an Account, to reactivate your Account and potentially recover previous information and resume where the relevant User left off you will need to request it to <a href='mailto:Support@chess.com' target='_blank'>support@chess.com</a> using the email address associated with your Account.</p>

  <p>If you want to permanently delete your PI you can request it manually by clicking on “Delete“ on the “<a href='https://www.chess.com/my-data' target='_blank'>My Data</a>“ section of the Services or by requesting deletion to <a href='mailto:Support@chess.com' target='_blank'>support@chess.com</a>. In this case, we will delete your PI, anonymize the information that will remain public such as games statistics, posts and comments, and block your email address and social media accounts from being used on Chess.com in the future.</p>

  <p>If you want your posts and public comments to be removed, you must delete them separately before requesting deletion. After you delete your personal data, Chess.com Support Staff will have no means to verify your identity and will not remove these posts for you.</p>

  <p>Any data deletion requests will be executed within the term provided by the applicable law.</p>

  <p>Please keep in mind that a request to delete PI may lead to cancellation of your Account or the inability to use certain Services, and if any other Account type is linked to a Member Account, a request to delete PI in one of the Accounts may be reflected in your other Account.</p>

    8. California Privacy Rights (CPRA)
  </h1>

  <p>This Section supplements the information contained in our Policy and applies solely to Users who reside in the State of California. We adopt this notice to comply with the CCPA. Any terms used in this Section have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA. Please note that we may claim legal exemptions for certain types of PI and certain of our Services from all or certain parts of the CCPA.</p>

  <p>The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their PI. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. In this section “you“ or “your“ refers to California residents. Under the CCPA, we are required to disclose the categories of sources from whom we collect PI, and the third parties with whom we share it -- which we already have explained above in Section “Information Collection“, Section “How We Use Information“, and Section “When We Disclose Information to Third Parties“.</p>

  <p>Only you as a California resident or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your PI.</p>

  <p>The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected PI or an authorized representative. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your interactions with us. We will not otherwise ask for PI from you that we would not otherwise maintain as part of us providing our Services.</li>

    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>

    <li>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PI relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an Account with us. We will only use PI provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&#039;s identity or authority to make the request.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>To exercise your rights you can always request it to us by sending an email to <a href='mailto:Support@chess.com' target='_blank'>support@chess.com</a> or by following the steps described below:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Right to access PI</strong>. You may be entitled to receive information regarding the categories of PI we collected, the sources from which we collected PI, the purposes for which we collected and shared PI, the categories of PI that we share and the categories of third parties to whom the PI was shared with, and the categories of PI that we disclosed for a business purpose in the last 12 months. You can exercise this right by requesting it on the “<a href='https://www.chess.com/my-data' target='_blank'>My data</a>“ Section of our Services.</li>

    <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong>. You may be entitled to receive a copy of your electronic PI in a readily usable format so you can transmit this data to another organization. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. You can exercise this right by requesting it on the “<a href='https://www.chess.com/my-data' target='_blank'>My data</a>“ Section of our Services.</li>

    <li><strong>Right to Correct</strong>. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate PI that we maintain about you. You are also able to correct any inaccurate PI manually by accessing your profile on the <a href='https://www.chess.com/settings' target='_blank'>Settings</a> sections of the Services.</li>

    <li><strong>Right to deletion</strong>. You may be entitled to request that we delete the PI that we have collected from you. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, in compliance with applicable laws. Please note, however, that we may need or be required to keep such information for our legitimate business purposes or to comply with applicable law. To know how to exercise your right to deletion, please refer to the section titled: “Account Cancellation and Reactivation; Data Deletion“ from this Policy.</li>

    <li><strong>Right to opt-out of certain sharing with third parties</strong>. We do not sell your personal information to third-parties. We only disclose certain information to our service providers when it is necessary to fulfill our business purposes and in accordance with this Policy.</li>

  </ul>

    Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.
  </h2>

  <p>Even though we do not share your information in exchange for compensation, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request us to not disclose your PI to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>

  <p>You can exercise such right to opt-out by submitting the following <a href='https://go.chess.com/opt-out' target='_blank'>form</a>.</p>

Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including the United States, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country.

    13. Security
  </h1>

  <p>The security of your PI is important to us, and we employ physical, technical, and administrative security measures designed to safeguard the information collected by the Services. We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer PI. Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to buildings and files. We also conduct periodic audits of our security (no less than annually) to apply best practices and reasonable industry standards. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. If there is a breach of our security, we will notify you where required by law or deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Account holders create a password in the registration process. You can help protect against unauthorized access to your Account and PI by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account. At registration, we assign a Member ID to each Account and use those Member IDs to authenticate logins, allow access to the subscription content, and monitor compliance. The Member ID is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two-factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions.</p>

  <p>Some of the precautions we take to protect PI includes: (a) limiting employee access to PI to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (b) conducting background checks on our employees and, specifically, upon all employees that may have access to PI; (c) requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements upon hiring; (d) conducting regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (e) protecting PI with commercially reasonable technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards.</p>

  <p>Please be aware, however, that no information system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Services over networks that we do not control, including the internet and wireless networks. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is not secure, please contact us as described in Section “Contact Us“ below.</p>

    16. Chess Play &amp; Learn (Arcade Version)
  </h1>

  <p>This Section contains the provisions that only apply specifically to our mobile application known as Chess - Play &amp; Learn (Arcade Version) (the “App“). This section is intended to complement the Policy above and it does not apply to our Sites or other Services.</p>

  <h2

    Data Collection and Use
  </h2>

  <p>The App collects non-identifiable gameplay data to send to Apple iCloud, specifically to record a User&#039;s progress (win record) vs. the App&#039;s built-in roster of computer opponents. We do not store any of this data, but it is sent to Apple services (iCloud and Game Center) for storage and use.</p>

  <p>The App also collects the User&#039;s anonymized Game Player ID for the App&#039;s “Online Play“ feature, where it is used to maintain a chess skill rating as online games are played. This helps ensure Users are matched with opponents of similar skill levels.</p>

  <p>The Game Player ID is also used to maintain a list of chess puzzles the User has solved in the App&#039;s “Daily Puzzle“ feature and may also be used for other App features if that is necessary to fulfill a User request. The processing of this data is subject to your consent and you are able to revoke such consent by changing the settings from your device.</p>

  <p>The App is available to Users through the different app stores and collects non-identifiable gameplay data from all Users. The basis for this collection of information is to support the internal operations of the App and your consent in some cases.</p>
