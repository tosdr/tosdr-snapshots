The Tilia Service</strong></h2><p>The Tilia Service is designed to allow you to: </p><blockquote>a)	make payments to the Publisher and other third parties supported by the Publisher for digital goods and services (“<strong>Digital Goods</strong>”);</blockquote><blockquote>b)	use issued tokens on a Platform to use or access features or content within a Publisher’s Platform;</blockquote><blockquote>c)	hold and load funds/value in a Stored Value Balance (as defined below, which may be in the form of USD or Earned Tokens) as compensation from the Publisher on whose Platform you create and sell content or otherwise enhance the value and experience of the Platform (such creators referred to hereunder as “Creators,” a subset of Users); </blockquote><blockquote>d)	facilitate the use of in-Platform content, and access other related services within a Platform; and,</blockquote><blockquote>e)	receive funds from Publishers as part of its rewards or revenue sharing programs, if applicable. </blockquote><p>While the Tilia Service is integrated into certain selected Platforms, the Tilia Service is offered by Tilia and not by the Publisher of the relevant Platform. Tilia will provide services to the Publisher to enable it to accept card payments by you to it, so that you can, for example, (i) pay the Publisher for subscriptions; (ii) purchase in-Platform tokens (known as Purchased Tokens) which may be used to pay for in-Platform Digital Goods from the Publisher; (iii) make other payments to the Publisher, or, (iv) remit funds on behalf of the Publisher as part of its rewards or revenue sharing programs, if applicable.</p><p>Tilia is not responsible for the provision of the Platform itself or any experience within the Platform—just the Tilia Service. This means, for example, that Tilia is not responsible or liable for the Digital Goods offered and provided by Publishers to you. </p><p>Tilia does not have control of, or liability for, any Publisher or other third party content that is accessed using the Tilia Service or any products or services that are paid for using the Tilia Service. In the event of any conflict between the relevant Platform TOS and these Terms, these Terms will govern as between you and Tilia, and with respect to the Tilia Service. </p><p>As the different features of the Tilia Service that are enabled for a particular Platform will be determined by the relevant Publisher and Tilia, the Platform TOS applicable to that Platform may use slightly different terminology to refer to the Tilia Service features available through the Platform. </p><p>In accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, Tilia has the right to change, limit access to, or eliminate any aspect(s), feature(s) or functionality of the Tilia Service in its sole discretion at any time without notice, and Tilia makes no commitment (express or implied) to offer, maintain, continue, or permit access to any aspect of the Tilia Service. Additionally, Tilia can authorize or decline a transaction effected with the Tilia Service for whatever reason (e.g., for suspected fraud or insufficient funds), restrict the number of transactions you may engage in over a period of time, or limit the amount of any transaction (either individually or in the aggregate over a period of time).</p><h2 id="our-relationship-with-you"><strong>2.

Payment Processing Service</h2><p>Tilia offers a service through which you may, using payment methods supported by Tilia, make payments to the relevant Publisher or other users of the Platform for products or services offered within the Platform and/or other amounts owed to the Publisher (such service, the “<strong>Payment Processing Service</strong>”). </p><p>In offering the Payment Processing Service, Tilia’s responsibilities to you are limited to remitting payment successfully received by Tilia from you to the relevant Publisher or user. Tilia is not responsible for any product or service purchased through your use of the Payment Processing Service, or for the amount or validity of any amount that may be charged by the relevant Publisher or user.</p><p>If the Payment Processing Service is enabled for a Platform that you use, you will be directed to a Tilia-hosted dialog box after selecting the option on the Platform to make a payment, at which time you will have the option to complete the transaction using one of the payment methods that Tilia supports. The different payment methods supported by the Payment Processing Service, such as credit cards, debit cards, etc., will be determined by Tilia in its sole discretion, and Tilia reserves the right to limit the payment methods made available for any particular transaction.</p><p>You may need to have an existing account or other access device in order to use a particular payment method, or meet other specific conditions imposed by the company responsible for offering such payment method (each a &quot;Payment Services Provider&quot; or &quot;PSP&quot;). Additionally, the PSP might have its own terms and conditions (including a privacy policy) that also apply to you and your use of the relevant payment method, even when such payment method is accessed through the Payment Processing Service. Tilia is not responsible for any terms and conditions, privacy policy, other policies and procedures, or any act or omission of any PSP.</p><p>In order to conduct a payment through the Payment Processing Service, you will need to provide your payment or account information, and any other information, required by Tilia and the PSP you have selected. The information required and the manner in which your transaction will be processed will vary depending upon the payment method you select. You are responsible for providing accurate transaction and payment information (including any relevant PSP credentials, preferences, or log-in information) in connection with your use of the Payment Processing Service. If you fail to provide accurate transaction or payment information, Tilia will not be able to complete the payment transaction.  You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other access devices accepted by Tilia continue to be valid and sufficient for such purposes and remain responsible to Tilia for the amount of any chargeback or returned payment. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Tilia, Tilia may exercise its termination rights as provided in Section 9 of these Terms in the event of non-payment.</p><p>Once you complete and submit the requested information to Tilia, Tilia will forward the relevant information you provide to the selected PSP, which will then authorize or decline the transaction according to its own processes and rules. If the transaction is authorized, the PSP will debit your account or designated funding source for the amount of the transaction (including any fees owed to Tilia for using the Payment Processing Service). Upon Tilia&#x27;s receipt of those funds from the PSP, Tilia will remit such amount (less any amounts owed to Tilia) to the Publisher in accordance with the payment terms established between Tilia and the Publisher or to the other user of the Platform. Payments made to a Publisher through your use of the Payment Processing Service will be credited by the Publisher in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Publisher. Please contact the Publisher for further information. We are not responsible for any delay with respect to when payments made to a Publisher will be credited to you, or any failure of a Publisher to accept or properly process any funds remitted to it. Once accepted by Tilia, you may not cancel a payment made through the Payment Processing Service or obtain a refund from Tilia for any such payment. In the event that you wish to obtain a refund of any payment made, you must contact the relevant Publisher, and the availability of any refund will be subject to the relevant Platform TOS and the determination of the relevant Publisher.</p><p>By using the Payment Processing Service, you authorize Tilia to:</p><ul role="list"><li>accept and remit payments made by you using the payment methods supported by Tilia for purchases or other transactions enabled for the particular Platform or for amounts owed to the relevant Publisher or user plus any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia;</li><li>provide your payment and/or account information, and any other information you have provided to Tilia, to the PSP you have selected as may be required to process your requested transaction;</li><li>automatically charge, in accordance with the instructions you provide for any recurring payments, the credit or debit card or other payment method you have associated with your Tilia Account in order to pay recurring amounts to the relevant Publisher, as well as any applicable taxes Tilia is required to collect or fees owed to Tilia; and,</li><li>maintain and utilize your PSP credentials, preferences, and log-in information.</li></ul><h2><strong id="stored-value-balance">4. Stored Value Balance</strong></h2><h3><strong>4.1. General</strong></h3><p>Tilia may offer a Stored Value Balance associated with your Tilia Account, which is a stored value account issued by Tilia in which you hold funds. </p><p>The Stored Value Balance services provided to you by Tilia are a hosted digital balance maintained by Tilia enabling you to store funds or Earned Tokens (defined below) electronically (the &quot;<strong>Stored Value Balance</strong>&quot;); and certain payment services enabling you to do the following:</p><blockquote>a)	receive funds or Earned Tokens electronically in accordance with Section 4.2 below (i.e., funds can be received into the Stored Value Balance from you, other Platform users, the Publisher, or as a result of the exchange of Earned Tokens issued by Tilia on a Platform); and,</blockquote><blockquote>b)	redeem funds held in the Stored Value Balance in accordance with Section 4.3 below.</blockquote><p>Depending on our arrangement with the Publisher, your Stored Value Balance may hold funds denominated in fiat or Earned Tokens, defined in Section 5 below, and we will show the balance that you hold, to the extent applicable. The default fiat for the Stored Value Balance will be United States Dollars (“<strong>USD</strong>”). </p><p><strong>The use of each Stored Value Balance is limited to the Platform in connection with which it is issued, meaning that it may not be used to make payments to any other Publisher, or through any other Platform, with which the Tilia Service is integrated.</strong></p><p>You will not grant to any third party any security interest in your Stored Value Balance.</p><h3><strong>4.2. Crediting the Stored Value Balance</strong></h3><p>When you engage in activities on a Platform that enable you to earn compensation from the Publisher pursuant to the Platform TOS, e.g., creating Digital Goods, completing tasks, or otherwise enhancing the experience of a Platform, you are referred to as a “Creator” and such activity is hereinafter referred to as “Compensable Activity.”  Such compensation can be in the form of a load to your Stored Value Balance (or in the form of Earned Tokens, as defined below, in a token-based economy).</p><p>Tilia will fund your Stored Value Balance as instructed by Publisher.  Funding will not take place until Tilia has successfully completed necessary checks to comply with applicable law and its internal risk management processes and only when funds to support the Stored Value Balance load have been received by Tilia from the Publisher. </p><p>Depending on the Platform, you may also fund your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat using any of our supported payment methods, which are set out and available on the Platform, such as credit or debit card or bank transfer. </p><p>Any associated fees (if applicable) will be published on the Platform. </p><p>Due to legal or regulatory reasons, we may need to impose certain restrictions on the methods you can use to pay money into your Stored Value Balance. We will try to keep you informed of any such changes. </p><p>The Stored Value Balance is not a deposit or investment account. </p><p>Fund we receive associated with your fiat-denominated Stored Value Balance will be deposited in a secure account, specifically for the purpose of redeeming transactions made from your Stored Value Balance. Funds will not be insured to you by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity, and you will not be entitled to any interest with respect to such funds. In the event that we become insolvent, funds that you have loaded which have arrived with and been deposited by us are protected against the claims made by our creditors.</p><h3><strong>4.3. Withdrawals and Redemptions</strong></h3><p>Subject to compliance with applicable law and our risk management processes, You may redeem all or part of any fiat-denominated balance held in your Stored Value Balance at any time. With respect to a Stored Value Balance denominated in Earned Tokens, only Earned Tokens acquired from the completion of Compensable Activity may be redeemed for fiat, either to fund your fiat-denominated Stored Value Balance or to be paid out directly to Your external financial account.  Digital Tokens that are “unearned” may not be redeemed for fiat.</p><p>Subject to compliance with applicable law and our risk management processes, funds will be transferred to your bank account or payment service provider which you have identified to us and which we support. For Earned Tokens, funds will be transferred to your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat or may be sent directly to Your external financial account that is supported by Tilia. <strong>Prior to loading your Stored Value Balance denominated in fiat, it is your responsibility to determine if funds can be transferred to the relevant payment service provider as certain payment service providers (e.g., PayPal) do not offer services in every jurisdiction. </strong></p><p>We will charge a redemption fee (a “<strong>Redemption Fee</strong>”) upon redemption of your Stored Value Balance. This fee is set out in the Fee Schedule published on the Website (which shall include the relevant Publisher platform).</p><p>Prior to redeeming funds from your Stored Value Balance, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. You may be prevented or delayed from withdrawing funds in the Stored Value Balance until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements. If we find that you have been engaged in fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes, you may lose all rights to any funds derived from such activity. </p><p>The redemption request will be subject to a fee payable to Tilia, and the redemption will be processed within approximately five (5) to ten (10) business days following the request but may take up to thirty (30) days to process.</p><p>If these Terms are terminated or your Tilia Account is closed for any reason, we will redeem any funds remaining in your Stored Value Balance and transfer funds to the external financial account you have registered with us. </p><p>Tilia has a right of set-off; therefore, if you owe Tilia fees or any other amount, we are permitted to take the amount you owe us from your Stored Value Balance.</p><p>You are responsible for paying taxes or costs that apply to payments you make or receive through your Stored Value Balance and Tilia is not responsible for collecting these from you.</p><h3><strong>4.4. Transactions Involving the Stored Value Balance</strong></h3><p>If applicable on a particular Platform, where a transaction is initiated from your Stored Value Balance using your security credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.</p><p>If you believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been carried out that you did not authorize (an &quot;<strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>&quot;), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your Stored Value Balance has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an &quot;<strong>Incorrect Transaction</strong>&quot;), you must contact us as soon as possible.</p><p>It is important that you regularly check your Stored Value Balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>We are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this Section 4.4, in which case we set out below our respective responsibilities. </p><p>As further described below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally, carelessly or with negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions.</p><p>During any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorized Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your Stored Value Balance to avoid further losses.</p><p>If an Unauthorized Transaction occurs as a result of Tilia’s failure, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of the Unauthorized Transaction and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state it would have been in had the Unauthorized Transaction not taken place.</p><p>Generally, you will not be liable for losses incurred after you have notified us of the Unauthorized Transaction or if we have failed at any time to provide you with the means for notifying us.</p><p>We may charge you for the first $20 of any losses you incur in respect of an Unauthorized Transaction which arises from the use of lost or stolen credentials (for example when you have failed to keep the login details secure), and if you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to carry out your obligations under these Terms and this results in Unauthorized Transactions (for example, if you deliberately share your email and password with a third party, or are careless or negligent in keeping your email and password secure), you may be liable for all resultant losses incurred as a result of any such Unauthorized Transactions, not just the first $20.</p><p>Where there is a dispute between us regarding whether or not a transaction is an Unauthorized Transaction, we may (but are not obliged to) temporarily credit your Stored Value Balance while we settle the dispute. </p><p>Where we determine that the transaction was authorized, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of Stored Value Balance without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your Stored Value Balance may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorized Transactions. You will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any funds you have transferred which were temporarily credited to your Stored Value Balance.</p><p>Where an Incorrect Transaction is made because of our action or error we shall refund to you the amount of that transaction without undue delay and restore your Stored Value Balance to the state in which it would have been had the Incorrect Transaction not taken place. We will also endeavour to provide you with reasonable notice where possible. We will also pay any charges for which we are responsible. Irrespective of our liability, on your request, we shall try to trace any Incorrect Transaction initiated by you free of charge. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to trace such transactions.</p><h2 id="digital-tokens"><strong>5. Digital Tokens</strong></h2><h3><strong>5.1. Issuance</strong></h3><p>Where supported by the Publisher in a token-based economy, the Tilia Service may include Tilia issuing (or managing Publisher’s issuance of) digital tokens to you, which can be used to access services and content within a Platform (“<strong>Digital Tokens</strong>”). Furthermore, Digital Tokens that are acquired by you engaging in Compensable Activities on an applicable Platform are “<strong>Earned Tokens</strong>” and deemed stored value in accordance with Section 4 (Stored Value Balances). If there are any inconsistencies between the two sections, then Section 4 controls. Digital Tokens which may only be used and redeemed for content and services within a Platform are deemed “<strong>Purchased Tokens</strong>.”  Purchased Tokens can never be redeemed for fiat and cannot be utilized outside the Platform for which they are created. Depending on a Platform, Digital Tokens may be used as a mechanism to track Compensable Activities. Earned Tokens and Purchased Tokens will have naming conventions that are specific to a Publisher’s Platform.</p><p>The manner in which you obtain access or use the Digital Tokens will depend on the Publisher and will be disclosed to you by the Publisher in the Platform ToS or on the Website.</p><h3><strong>5.2. Accumulating Earned Tokens </strong></h3><p>As indicated above, in the case of token-based economies, Creators may also receive compensation in the form of Earned Tokens for Compensable Activities. Earned Tokens are issued by Tilia.  Earned Tokens may be redeemed for fiat (e.g., USD). </p><h3><strong>5.3. Using Digital Tokens </strong></h3><p>The use of each Digital Token is limited to the Platform in connection with which it is issued, meaning that it may not be used or transferred to any other Publisher, or through any other Platform, with which the Tilia Service is integrated. </p><p>Digital Tokens may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition or use by operation of law or otherwise and you agree that any attempted disposition or use of such Digital Tokens in violation of these Terms is null and void. </p><h3><strong>5.4. Termination of Access to Digital Tokens</strong></h3><p>We may revoke or terminate your access to Digital Tokens (other than Earned Tokens) in the event that:</p><blockquote>a)	the Digital Token program is suspended or terminated by the relevant Publisher;</blockquote><blockquote>b)	we reasonably suspect or know that fraud or other illegal conduct is associated with your Tilia Account or your use of your Tilia Account or any aspects of the Tilia Service;</blockquote><blockquote>c)	you have breached the relevant Publisher’s terms of service;</blockquote><blockquote>d)	the Publisher of the relevant Platform directs us to terminate your access to Digital Tokens; and/or</blockquote><blockquote>e)	these Terms are terminated.</blockquote><h2 id="disbursements"><strong>6. Disbursements</strong></h2><p>On Platforms where Publishers pay Creators directly for Compensable Activity, Tilia facilitates the transfer of funds from the Publisher to the Creator&#x27;s external financial account (each such transfer called a “Disbursement”). All Disbursements are made pursuant to instructions received by Tilia from the Publisher and are subject to applicable law and Tilia’s risk management processes.</p><h2 id="intellectual-property"><strong>7.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></h2><h3><strong>13.1. Notifications of Dispute</strong></h3><p>Our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. If any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Tilia Service, the Website(s), the Content, these Terms, your decision to enter into these Terms, or any Additional Terms (collectively, “<strong>Dispute</strong>”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. However, if no such information exists or if such information is not current or correct, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to: Tilia Inc., 548 Market St. PMB 59201, San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US, Attention: General Counsel. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Tilia and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party, in its sole discretion, is uncomfortable. Arbitration Procedure</p><p>IF WE CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THEN EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO FORMAL ARBITRATION AS HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED. WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.</p><p>Further, you and Tilia agree that, should resolution of the Dispute(s) occur in arbitration, such Dispute(s) will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction, limiting the arbitration to Dispute(s) between you and Tilia, is unenforceable, then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 14.5 (Law and Venue).</p><p>Should either you or Tilia elect to resolve the Dispute by way of binding arbitration, the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;), except that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten (10) years&#x27; experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $10,000,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three (3) member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will chair the panel) selected by the two (2) party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.</p><p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a &quot;demand for arbitration,&quot; then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&quot;<strong>JAMS</strong>&quot;) using JAMS&#x27; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of Tilia consent to in writing, except, as noted above, that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or other arbitration service.</p><p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p><p>AAA: 1.800.778.7879 or <a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a></p><p>JAMS: 1.800.352.5267 or <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a></p><p>All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, an arbitration hearing will be conducted, at your election, either by telephone (or other mutually agreeable remote technology) or in the City and County of San Francisco, California. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco, California. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&#x27;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules (including any rules regarding hardship); but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Tilia to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, or if the arbitrator(s) determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the Dispute, then Tilia will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys&#x27; fees) consistent with applicable law.</p><h2><strong id="general-provisions">14. General Provisions</strong></h2><h3><strong>14.1. Amendments</strong></h3><p>We may change these Terms at any time in our sole discretion to the extent permitted by law. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Website and/or provide you notice of the modification by email or conspicuous notification, such as a popup, on the Platform and, in the event any such modifications decrease your rights or increase your obligations, will do so prior to such modification taking effect.</p><p>When we change these Terms, the then-current version of these Terms supersedes all prior versions and governs your access to and use of the Tilia Service. If you continue to maintain your Tilia Account or use any portion of the Tilia Service following any change, you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to any changes, as of the effective date of any such change. If you do not wish to be bound to the changes, you must close your Tilia Account (see Section 9.6 for details) and cease using the Tilia Service. </p><p>If any part of these Terms are inconsistent with any legal requirements then we will not rely on that part but treat it as if it did actually reflect the relevant legal requirement. If we need to make operational changes before we can fully comply with the new regulatory requirement, we will make those changes as soon as reasonably practical.</p><p>You can obtain a copy of the current Terms <a href="/legal/terms-of-service/branch_terms-of-service">here</a> or by e-mailing a request to us at tilia-support@tilia.io.</p><h3><strong>14.2. Entire Understanding and Agreement</strong></h3><p>Any headings or descriptive summary sentences contained in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms. Additionally, the terms “include” and “including” are not limiting. As used in these Terms, references to a determination made in Tilia’s discretion means that the determination will be made by Tilia in accordance with its good faith business judgment. If any provision of these Terms shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p><p>These Terms (including documents incorporated by reference herein) comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and us as to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these Terms), and every nature between and among you and Tilia.</p><h3><strong>14.3. Assignment</strong></h3><p>You may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under these Terms without our prior written consent. You may not transfer or sublicense any licenses granted by Tilia in these Terms without our prior written consent. </p><p>We may transfer or assign our rights licences, interests and/or our obligations at any time, including as part of a merger, acquisition or other corporate reorganisation involving Tilia, provided that this transfer or assignment does not materially impact the quality of the Tilia Service you receive. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>In the event that Tilia is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you and our relationship with you (including these Terms) as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p><h3><strong>14.4. Inconsistency</strong></h3><p>In the event of a conflict or inconsistency of a provision in these Terms and a provision in any other document or agreement, the provision that is most favourable to Tilia shall govern and control.</p><p>If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, this will not affect the validity of any other provision. If any provision is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will be enforced.</p><p>We may not always strictly enforce our rights under these Terms. If we do choose not to enforce our rights at any time, this is a temporary measure and we may enforce our rights strictly again at any time.</p><h3><strong>14.5. Law and Venue</strong></h3><p>These Terms and the relationship between us shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Further, you and Tilia agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, except as provided in Section 13 regarding arbitration.</p><p>These Terms and any information or notifications that you or we are to provide should be in English. Any translation of these Terms or other documents is provided for your convenience only and may not accurately represent the information in the original English. In the event of any inconsistency, the English language version of these Terms or other documents shall prevail.</p><p>All provisions of these Terms which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the Sections relating to suspension or termination, the Tilia Account cancellation, debts owed to Tilia, general use of the Website, disputes with Tilia, and general provisions will continue to be binding and operate after the termination or expiration of these Terms.</p><h3><strong>14.6. No Equitable or Injunctive Relief</strong></h3><p>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE TILIA SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES AND DAMAGES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, CONTENT, PRODUCT, TILIA SERVICE, PLATFORM, PROVIDER OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, OR CONTROLLED BY TILIA OR A LICENSOR OF TILIA.</p><h3><strong>14.7. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs</strong></h3><p>All claims you bring against Tilia must be resolved in accordance with Section 13, Dispute Resolution and Arbitration, except as expressly provided therein. All claims filed or brought contrary to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of these Terms of Service. Should either party file a claim contrary to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to one thousand USD ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p></aside></div></section><footer class="footer-container"><div class="section-container footer w-container"><div class="footer-positioning"><div class="footer-left-section"><div class="footer-logo-container"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60a546cad5c4cc870d2468d5/65a9be214a91b4cafa71461d_tilia-logo-white-r.svg" loading="lazy" width="120" alt="" class="image-11"/><div class="tilia-legal-logo-text-block">© 2023 Tilia LLC.
