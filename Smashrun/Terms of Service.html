				        <strong>Health Precautions</strong>
				        It is always important to consult your physician before starting an
				        exercise program or changing your diet! This is particularly true if any
				        of the following apply to your current medical condition:</p>
				        <ul>
					        <li>Chest pain or pain in the neck and/or arm</li>
					        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
					        <li>A diagnosed heart condition</li>
					        <li>Joint and/or bone problems</li>
					        <li>Currently taking cardiac and/or blood pressure medications</li>
					        <li>Have not previously been physically active</li>
					        <li>Dizziness</li><p>
				        </ul>
			        </p>
			        <p>
				        Ensure You start gradually and sensibly. If You feel any of the physical
				        symptoms listed above before, or at the beginning of your exercise program,
				        contact your physician right away. Make sure you consult your physician
				        before beginning an exercise program. An exercise-stress test may be used
				        to help plan your exercise program. It is important to recognize that the
