<p>We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.</p>

<p>Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.</p>

                          Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewer’s interests and to direct marketing to them. </p>

<p>We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.</p>

<p>Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting certain data through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use. When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request.

                <p>4.3 Notices on behavioral advertising and opt-out for website visitors</p>
                <p>As described above, we or one of our authorized partners may place or read cookies on your device when you visit our websites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”). To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks, please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="blank">here</a>, and the Digital Advertising Alliance, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="blank">here</a>. To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce Audience Studio, click <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/sfmc/salesforce-dmp-consumer-choice/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To manage the use of targeting and advertising cookies on this website, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page or consult your individual browser settings for cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" target="blank">here</a>. Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.</p>
                
                <p>4.4 Opt-Out from the setting of cookies on your individual browser</p>

<p>In addition to using the user preference center, in many cases you may opt-out from the collection of non-essential device data on your web browser (see Section 4.1 above) by managing your cookies at the browser or device level. In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="blank">here</a> (or, if located in the European Union or United Kingdom, click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="blank">here</a>).  To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce Audience Studio, click <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/sfmc/salesforce-dmp-consumer-choice/">here</a>. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the websites.</p>

<p>While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
                
                <p>4.5 Social Media Features</p>

<p>Our websites may use social media features, such as the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.</p>

<p>Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.</p>

<p>Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.</p>

<p>4.6 Telephony log information</p>

<p>If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers).</p>

    <p>We may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection (see Section 5 above) or as long as required to fulfill our legal obligations. We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data being processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Data, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).  </p>
<p>After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Data will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will implement appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.  </p>

    <p>10.1 Your rights</p>
<p>You may have certain rights relating to your Personal Data, subject to local data protection laws. Depending on the applicable laws these rights may include the right to:</p>
<p>• Access your Personal Data held by us;</p>
<p>• Know more about how we process your Personal Data;</p>
<p>• Rectify inaccurate Personal Data and, taking into account the purpose of processing the Personal Data, ensure it is complete;</p>
<p>• Erase or delete your Personal Data;</p>
<p>• Restrict our processing of your Personal Data;</p>
<p>• Transfer your Personal Data to another controller, to the extent possible;</p>
<p>• Object to any processing of your Personal Data;</p>
<p>• Opt out of certain disclosures of your Personal Data to third parties;</p>
<p>• Know what categories of Personal Data are shared for delivering advertisements on non-Salesforce websites, applications, and services and the categories of recipients of such Personal Data;</p>
<p>• Opt out of the sharing of your Personal Data for delivering advertisements on non-Salesforce websites, applications, and services;</p>
<p>• If you’re under the age of 16, or such other applicable age of consent for privacy purposes in relevant individual jurisdictions, opt in to certain disclosures of your Personal Data to third parties;</p>
<p>• Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects ("Automated Decision-Making");</p>
<p>• Withdraw your consent at any time (to the extent we base processing on consent), without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on such consent before its withdrawal; and</p>
<p>• Not be discriminated against for exercising your rights as described above.</p>
<p>Where we process your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes or share it with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, you can exercise your right to object at any time to such processing without having to provide any specific reason for such objection.</p>
<p>Please note that Automated Decision-Making currently does not take place on our websites or in our services.</p>
<p>10.2 How to exercise your rights</p>
<p>To exercise your rights, please contact us by using the information in Section 13 below. Your Personal Data may be processed in responding to these rights. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month unless otherwise required by law, and will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honor your request or verify your identity. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month, taking into account the complexity and number of requests we receive. If you are an employee of a Salesforce customer, we recommend you contact your employer’s system administrator for assistance in correcting or updating your information.</p>
<p>Some registered users may update their user settings, profiles, organization settings and event registrations by logging into their accounts and editing their settings or profiles.</p>
<p>To update your billing information, discontinue your account or request return or deletion of your Personal Data and other information associated with your account, please contact us by using the information in Section 13 below.</p>
<p>10.3 Your rights relating to customer data</p>
<p>As described above, we may also process Personal Data submitted by or for a customer to our products and services. To this end, if not stated otherwise in this Privacy Statement or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data as a processor on behalf of our customer (and its affiliates) who is the controller of the Personal Data (see Section 1 above). We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those explained in this Privacy Statement. If your data has been submitted to us in our role as a processor by or on behalf of a Salesforce customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with them directly. Because we may only access a customer’s data upon their instructions, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide us the name of the Salesforce customer who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>10.4 Your preferences for email and SMS marketing communications</p>
<p>If we process your Personal Data for the purpose of sending you marketing communications, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications from Salesforce by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of Salesforce marketing emails, by replying or texting ‘STOP’ if you receive Salesforce SMS communications, or by unsubscribing here. Please note that, notwithstanding the above, you will continue to receive marketing and non-transactional communications from CMO Club unless you manage your receipt of such communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of CMO Club’s marketing emails.</p>
<p>You may also turn off push notifications on Salesforce apps on your device, or unsubscribe by contacting us using the information in the “Contacting us” section, below.</p>
<p>Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements or security information.</p>
<p>10.5 Your preferences for telemarketing communications</p>
<p>If you want your phone number to be added to our internal Do-Not-Call telemarketing register, please contact us by using the information in Section 13 below. Please include your first name, last name, company and the phone number you wish to add to our Do-Not-Call register.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can always let us know during a telemarketing call that you do not want to be called again for marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) requires businesses to disclose whether they sell or share Personal Data. As a business covered by the CCPA, we do not sell Personal Data.  We may share Personal Data (in the form of identifiers and internet activity information) with third party advertisers for purposes of targeting advertisements on non-Salesforce websites, applications and services. In addition, we may allow third parties to collect Personal Data from our sites or services if those third parties are authorized service providers who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Data, or if you use Salesforce sites or services to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your Personal Data to third parties.</p>
<p>California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Data that we disclose for certain “business purposes,” such as to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products, and to such other entities as described in Sections 5 and 6 of this Privacy Statement. We disclose the following categories of Personal Data for our business purposes:</p>
<p>• Identifiers;</p>
<p>• Commercial information;</p>
<p>• Internet activity information;</p>
<p>• Financial information;</p>
<p>• Professional and employment-related information;</p>
<p>• Education information;</p>
<p>• Geolocation data;</p>
<p>• Audio and visual data;</p>
<p>• In limited circumstances where allowed by law, information that may be protected characteristics under California or United States law; and</p>
<p>• Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</p>
<p>California law grants state residents certain rights, including the rights to know and access specific types of Personal Data, to learn how we process Personal Data, to request deletion of Personal Data, to request correction of Personal Data, to opt-out of sharing your Personal Data for third party advertising purposes, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our website(s). Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.</p>
<p>For information on how to exercise your rights, please refer to Section 10.2 of this Privacy Statement. If you are an authorized agent wishing to exercise rights on behalf of a California resident, please contact us using the information in the “Contacting Us” section above and provide us with a copy of the consumer’s written authorization designating you as their agent.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of shares using your cookie identifiers, turn on a Global Privacy Control in your web browser or browser extension. Please see the California Privacy Protection Agency’s website at https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa for more information on valid Global Privacy Controls.  If you would like to opt-out of shares using other identifiers (like email address), please refer to Section 10.2 of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>We may need to verify your identity and place of residence before completing your rights request.</p>
