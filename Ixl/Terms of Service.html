  <b>Effective date:</b>
  March 11<sup>th</sup>
  , 2024
</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in using the online services operated by IXL Learning, Inc. (hereafter called "IXL"). These Terms of Service govern your use of online and/or mobile services, websites, and software provided on or in connection with www.ixl.com (collectively, the "Service"), which are offered through (i) www.ixl.com, (ii) mobile applications associated with www.ixl.com, and (iii) any other IXL website, app or online service which links to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>
  By accessing or using the Service, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked "I Agree" (or something similar), you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the "Agreement"), and to the collection, processing, and sharing of your information as set forth in our <a href="/privacypolicy/serviceprivacypolicy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. IXL reserves the right to modify this Agreement so long as it provides notice of these changes to you as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or otherwise use the Service ("you" or "Users"). If you open an IXL account on behalf of a School, company, organization, or other entity, then "you" includes you and that entity.
</p>
<p><b>A note about Student Data:</b> This Service may be purchased by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, or teachers (collectively referred to as "Schools") that use our services for educational purposes. When IXL contracts with a School to provide the Service, we may collect or have access to Student Data (defined below), which may be provided by the School or by the student. Such Student Data may, in some cases, contain information (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) that is considered sensitive under certain applicable United States ("US") state privacy laws. We consider Student Data to be strictly confidential and in general do not use such data for any purpose other than improving and providing our Services to the School or on the school's behalf. It is solely your responsibility to obtain the necessary and proper consent, where required by law, for you to use Student Data and for you to transfer Student Data to IXL for our subsequent use. Our collection, processing and sharing of Student Data is governed by this Agreement and any applicable laws and regulations including, in the U.S., provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and applicable state laws, including without limitation the Illinois Student Online Personal Protection Act ("SOPPA").</p>
<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</b></p>




  <h2>1. THE SERVICE</h2>

  
    <p>The Service helps its users to learn and practice various subjects including mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new or improved features to the Service shall be provided subject to this Agreement. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "as-is" and that IXL assumes no responsibility for any mistakes, errors, or omissions, including any unavailability of the Service, deletion or loss of any data relating to the Service, or failure to obtain the proper consent to collect, use, and share Student Data with IXL for IXL's subsequent use.</p>
    <p>IXL grants you a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and license to use the Service. You agree that you will not copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Software. You agree not to modify the Software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the Software, including (without limitation) for obtaining unauthorized access to the Service. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interface that is provided by IXL for use in accessing the Service.</p>
    <p>To use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees or other costs associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet, including a computer and modem or other access device.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY AND AUTHORITY</h2>

  
  
    <p>IXL does not sell the Service to children, but only to adults who can purchase the Service with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Service only with the involvement and consent of a parent, legal guardian, or at the direction of your School. Your School may impose additional policies regarding the use of the Service, with which you must comply.</p>
    <p>If you open an IXL account to provide the Service to students in a School, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School with the authority to bind the School to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the School's behalf. If you contact IXL to take any action with respect to an account, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority to request such action(s) from or on behalf of the account-holder (e.g., a School or Parent).</p>
    <p>The U.S. Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. If you are a School providing the Service to children under 13, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents or have received appropriate consent for IXL to collect and use information from students under 13 before allowing such students to access our Service. Use of the Services is conditioned upon Schools obtaining the proper parental and student consent, where necessary, for Schools to collect Student Data and to subsequently share that data with IXL for IXL's use. IXL assumes no responsibility for failure to obtain proper and necessary consent. Therefore, we recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents and obtain appropriate consent regarding their use of service providers such as IXL and that they provide a copy of our Privacy Policy and the IXL Learning Student Data Privacy Pledge to parents.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h2>

  
  
  
    <p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or IXL has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, IXL has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>4. GENERAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h2>

  
  
  
  
    <p>IXL sells access to the Service to a subscriber in the form of an account. Each account is provided for a term and price subject to certain renewal, cancellation, and other terms and conditions specific to the account (the "Account Terms"). The Account Terms are identified (in order of precedence) in the then-current quote or sales contract for the account, the selections made and account-specific terms disclosed when signing up for the account (which may be confirmed by e-mail), the description of account terms accessible through the IXL website when signed in to an appropriate user associated with the account and the default Account Terms set forth below. Each account may have Account Terms in addition to or different from those as set forth in this Agreement, but only to the extent set forth in a signed writing by the account subscriber and an officer of IXL.</p>
    <p>IXL provides a variety of "account types" which may apply depending on the subscriber and the way an IXL account is created. Each account type has a default set of Account Terms which apply unless superseded as set forth above. IXL reserves the right to provision accounts that do not belong to any of these default account types and/or to provision accounts with different Account Terms regardless of its account type.</p>
    <p class="text-underline"><b>Account Types:</b></p>
    <ul class="indent list-bullet">
      <li>
        Family Account &mdash; A family account is purchased by or for a Parent. Family accounts are generally only available for purchase through the IXL website or a third-party app store using a credit card. A family account typically includes child profiles that can be used by a Parent's child at the Parent's direction. Family account subscriptions are generally for a term of one month or one year. The term is disclosed at the time of purchase. If multiple terms are available, the term can be selected at the time of purchase or later changed by contacting <a href="mailto:support@ixl.com">support@ixl.com</a>. Family accounts automatically renew. See Section 6 below for more information about automatic renewal and cancellation of automatically renewing accounts.
      </li>
      <li>Classroom Account &mdash; A classroom account is purchased by or on behalf of a school, such as by a teacher. Classroom accounts may generally be purchased either through the IXL website, or by phone or e-mail. A classroom account typically includes a single teacher user and a small number of student users (which may vary depending on the purchase). A classroom account is typically for a term of one year. The term is disclosed at the time of purchase. Classroom accounts do not automatically renew. Action must be taken by the school or its authorized representative (e.g., teacher) to renew and continue using a classroom account past the end of the term. A classroom account is a type of school account. More information relating to school accounts may be found in Section 5 below.</li>
      <li>Site Account &mdash; A site account is purchased by or on behalf of a school or school district. Site accounts may be purchased by phone or e-mail. A site account typically includes an unlimited number of teacher users and a set maximum number of student users (which may vary depending on the purchase). A site account may be for a term of one year or longer. The term is disclosed at the time of purchase. Site accounts do not automatically renew. Action must be taken by the school or its authorized representative (e.g., school administrator) to renew and continue using a site account past the end of the term. A site account is a type of school account. More information relating to school accounts may be found in Section 5 below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Quotes and Proposals:</b></span>
      Any quotes or proposals provided by IXL are valid only for a limited time and are effective only with the agreement of the relevant parties. Quotes and proposals may be withdrawn by IXL at any time in its sole discretion. Quotes and proposals may include information that is proprietary and confidential to IXL and to the maximum extent permitted by law may not be disclosed to anyone other than their intended recipient. By requesting and/or accepting receipt of a quote or proposal from IXL you agree to keep such quotes or proposals confidential, to not disclose such quotes or proposals to any third party, and to immediately return and/or destroy all quote and proposal materials upon receiving a request to do so from IXL. To the extent that public records laws may apply to a quote or proposal provided by IXL, you agree to immediately notify IXL of any public records request that may result in disclosure of an IXL quote or proposal and provide IXL all reasonable opportunities to take steps to prevent such disclosure to the maximum extent permitted by law and will reasonably cooperate with IXL.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Payments:</b></span>
      School accounts have the option to make payment by credit card, check, or other methods at IXL's discretion (contact us for details). Payment must be received by IXL no later than 30 days after IXL issues an invoice. If IXL does not receive payment within 30 days, the invoice is past due and IXL reserves the right to suspend access to the affected school account(s) and take collection action. Suspension of an account does not relieve the account-holder of its obligation to pay for the account. IXL reserves the right to charge a late fee in the amount of 1% per month or the maximum permitted by law and its reasonable attorney's fees in securing payment of past due amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Cancellation:</b></span>
      Except as set forth below or otherwise agreed by IXL in a signed writing, accounts may not be canceled until the end of the current term of the account. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all cancellations requested before the end of the then-current term will be effective at the end of the current term.
    </p>
    <p>IXL permits early cancellations only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul class="indent list-bullet">
      <li>In the event that the Service is permanently discontinued.</li>
      <li>IXL otherwise permits early cancellations only to the extent required by applicable law. In the event of such an early cancellation, the parties agree that the account-holder is responsible for all amounts due and payable before the date of early cancellation without pro-ration or to the greatest extent permitted by law. The parties agree that IXL's efforts in selling, provisioning and providing an account are front-loaded and for that reason, pro-ration of fees in the event of early cancellation is not necessary or appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>End of Subscription:</b></span>
      When an account subscription ends (e.g., at the end of the term if the account has not been renewed or has been canceled), the account no longer permits access to the Service. However, IXL may, at its sole discretion, permit continued, limited access for users of the Account for a limited time after the conclusion of the term. The Service includes built-in capabilities to download and export information relating to the account. If an account-holder or any of its users wishes to save or maintain any data, it is the account-holder and its user's sole obligation to download such data before the conclusion of the term. Once the term of an account ends, IXL may delete data relating to an account in accordance with this Agreement and the Privacy Policy. It is the account-holder's sole responsibility to request renewal of accounts that do not automatically renew to maintain continued access to the account and its associated data.

  <h2>5. SCHOOL ACCOUNTS AND STUDENT DATA</h2>

  
  
  
  
  
    <p>This Section 5 applies to a School's use of the Service.</p>
    <p>When IXL is used by a School for an educational purpose, IXL may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by a student. "Student Data" is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable student and may include "educational records" as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") as well as "sensitive" Student Data as defined by applicable US state privacy laws.</p>
    <p>The School or the student, and not IXL, owns and controls the Student Data. It is the School's responsibility to obtain proper consent to collect and control the Student Data, where necessary. You authorize IXL to access, collect, transmit, modify, display and store Student Data to provide the Service and as described in this Agreement and in our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Compliance with Laws.</b></span>
      In the U.S., IXL may collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 U.S.C. &#xA7; 1232(g). Individually and collectively, we and our School Users agree to uphold our obligations under FERPA, COPPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment ("PPRA"), applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and with all other laws and regulations governing the protection of Student Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Use of Student Data.</b></span>
      By submitting, providing us access to, or causing us to receive Student Data, you agree that IXL may use the Student Data for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School's or the User's consent. IXL is not responsible for obtaining proper consent to collect and use Student Data, including for IXL's own use of such Student Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Use of De-Identified or Anonymized Student Data.</b></span>
      You agree that both before and after the term of the Agreement, IXL may collect, analyze, use, and retain data derived from Student Data as well as data about users' access and use of the Service, for the purpose of operating, analyzing, improving or marketing the Service, developing new products or services, conducting research or other purposes, provided that IXL may not share or publicly disclose information that is derived from Student Data unless such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Use of Personal Information for Marketing.</b></span>
      You agree that IXL may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school, teacher or district administrative users and other non-student users from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, IXL shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Disclosure of Student Data and Third-Party Service Providers.</b></span>
      You acknowledge and agree that IXL may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information to provide their services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data. IXL shall not share Student Data with third parties other than as described in this Agreement and in the IXL Privacy Policy, or without consent of the School or parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Student Data Access and Deletion Requests.</b></span>
      You may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, and we shall comply with such request within thirty (30) days, except that IXL shall not be required to delete Student Data that has been moved to a personal family account on the Service or as otherwise prohibited by law. A parent or student over the age of 18 seeking to access, modify, correct, or delete personal information in a student account that is connected to a School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification. IXL is not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data if such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Data Security and Breach Notification.</b></span>
      We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information in IXL's possession and control from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. If an unauthorized party gains access to or has been disclosed Student Data (a "Security Event"), that we have collected or received through the Service under this Agreement, we will promptly notify the School. If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of IXL or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws and IXL shall indemnify the School for reasonable costs related to legally-required notifications. With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of IXL or its agents, IXL shall reasonably cooperate with School's investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School's reasonable expense, but IXL shall not indemnify a School for costs associated with the Security Event. IXL shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to users that are not associated with a School account.

      You can find specific details regarding your membership with IXL at any time.

    <p><span class="text-underline"><b>Billing and Automatic Renewals.</b></span></p>
    <p>MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL FEES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOUR CARD ON FILE EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD (MONTHLY OR YEARLY), UNTIL YOU CANCEL.</p>
    <p>By starting your IXL membership, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you the membership fee associated with the term of your membership (e.g., monthly or yearly) you chose during registration. Thereafter, we will automatically renew your subscription on each (monthly or yearly) anniversary of your subscription date, and we will charge your then-current payment method (or to a different payment method if you change your account information) associated with your account with the applicable then-current fee and any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed. Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice. As used in this Agreement, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that the amount billed each billing period may vary for reasons that include differing amounts due to changes in your membership plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes. If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in Payment Method, such as your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information from your Subscription details page. To access your Subscription details page, sign in to your IXL account, click on the account menu in the upper-right corner, and select Subscription details. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you authorize us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>
    <p>You must cancel your membership before it renews each billing period to avoid billing of the next membership fee to your Payment Method. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month or year thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. Sign in to your IXL account, click on the account menu in the upper-right corner, and select Subscription details to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership charges are fully earned upon payment.</p>
    <p>Note: In the event your monthly membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Cancellation of Automatic Renewals.</b></span>
      You may cancel your IXL membership at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. You will continue to have access to the program until the current billing period ends. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partially used membership periods. To cancel your membership, sign in to your IXL account and click the words "Cancel membership" on your Subscription details page. Follow the instructions for cancellation under the heading "Cancel Membership."

      <span class="text-underline"><b>30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee.</b></span>
      If you are not satisfied, a full refund of the purchase price can be requested within thirty (30) days of the Purchase Date. The thirty-day money back guarantee is limited to purchases made directly through IXL.com and does not apply to purchases made through any third-party vendors including Apple or Google.

    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Price Changes.</b></span>
      We reserve the right to adjust the pricing for our Service, including but not limited to membership subscription plans, in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, any price changes will take effect following posting or other notice to you (e.g., e-mail).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-underline"><b>Purchases through Third-Party Stores.</b></span>
      If you purchased your IXL membership through a third-party store, such as through your Apple iTunes or Google Play account, portions of this Section may not apply to you. Because such a purchase is between you and the third-party store, and not IXL, you acknowledge and agree that IXL is not responsible for billing for your membership and is not responsible or liable for any claims relating to the billing of your purchase. If you have questions about membership or billing, you should contact the Apple iTunes store directly.

    <p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &#xA7;&#xA7; 1-16). This Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar legislation as may be enacted, shall not apply to this Agreement. If you are located outside of the territory of the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.</p>
    <p>You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Mateo County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.

    <p>
      READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM IXL. For any dispute with IXL, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legalnotices@ixl.com">legalnotices@ixl.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that IXL has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>. The arbitration will be conducted in San Mateo County, California, unless you and IXL agree otherwise. If you are a School or are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing IXL from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
