<p>Last updated: February 13, 2024</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we process, handle, or otherwise maintain data we collect, including in connection with your use of our products, services, APIs, apps, and websites that link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
<p>Clearbit is committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly. We value the data you share with us and treat it with respect.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Clearbit! So, Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>API Hub, Inc. dba Clearbit is a Delaware corporation and HubSpot Affiliate, with a registered office at 548 Market St. #95879, San Francisco, CA 94104 (&quot;Clearbit,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; etc.). To contact us, see the &quot;Contact Us!&quot; section below.</p>
<p>Clearbit, a B2B Marketing Intelligence tool, provides go-to-market teams with a comprehensive B2B dataset across company, contact, and IP address intelligence. By using our full dataset, customers are able to enrich key systems, build products, and power personalization.</p>
<p>Our Services are designed to help our customers and partners in a wide variety of ways, including by helping them determine which companies might make the best customers, identify the contacts within those organizations by department, role, or seniority to improve or expedite their interactions with those companies, and enabling them to personalize their interactions with those companies.</p>
<p><strong>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect or maintain, including through our website (&quot;Site&quot;), software (including APIs, browser extensions, and integrations with third-party software) and other Services.</p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy includes additional notices that may apply to you if you live in certain jurisdictions, such as residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Brazil, or California.</strong>  These notices may include information on how to exercise certain rights you may have with respect to personal information. Please see the section below titled &quot;Additional Notices for Specific Jurisdictions&quot; for more details.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any companies we don&#x27;t control, including the privacy practices of our customers. For example, our customers may obtain information from Clearbit about business contacts or prospects. We do not control their use and disclosure of this information. In certain circumstances, we act as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, and in those circumstances, it is the customer that is responsible for the processing of your personal information. For clarity, if we process personal information under an agreement in which Clearbit acts as a processor or service provider to a customer, that agreement governs the processing of your personal information and not this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns with the privacy practices of our customers or other third parties, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those entities.</p>

<p><strong>Information from cookies, web server logs, and other technologies</strong></p>
<p>Like many other commercial websites, we may also automatically gather information in connection with your use of the Site or Services through the use of &quot;cookies&quot; and other similar technologies such as web server logs, pixels, and end-user website activity (collectively, &quot;Tracking Technologies&quot;), including the Clearbit tag.

<p>We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Services. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to <a href="https://clearbit.com/www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.

<p>Third Parties:</p>
<p>Third parties, including certain data vendors and our customers, may provide us with information through licensing, sponsorship, or other agreements.

<p>In addition, we may collect information from third parties such as customers, web-based and mobile networks, exchanges, aggregators, and publishers that is collected from their sites and properties, which might include identifiers such as IP address, cookie and other unique identifiers that might be considered personal information. The type of information collected via the identifiers might include information about online behavior, such as pages visited, time spent on a web page, session start/stop time, whether the visitor scrolled through or clicked on an ad or webpage, and referring website address, that is then associated with the company identified.</p>
<p><strong>Clearbit Indexers</strong></p>
<p>Our proprietary indexing systems (&quot;Clearbit Indexers&quot;) collect information from a variety of sources in order to compile &quot;Attribute Data&quot; about corporations, non-profits, and similar entities (&quot;Companies&quot;) and the professionals that work for them (&quot;Professionals&quot;). A complete list of Attribute Data we make available to users of the Site and Services can be found at <a href="https://clearbit.com/attributes">www.clearbit.com/attributes</a>.</p>
<p>Our Clearbit Indexers collect a variety of information and data for purposes of creating our database of Attribute Data and for providing, improving, and maintaining the Services.

<p>(2) through licensing agreements directly with data brokers or other Companies; and</p>
<p>(3) directly contributed by individuals about both Professionals and Companies, except where such information is provided pursuant to an agreement in which Clearbit acts as a processor or service provider.</p>
<p>We use Attribute Data to provide the Services, for internal research and development purposes, and to maintain and improve the quality of our Services. We may also use Attribute Data to collect metadata, such as activity signals or IP registration information. We use this metadata to improve the quality of the Clearbit Indexers, and to verify the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our Attribute Data.</p>
<p>Our Services are designed to help our customers and partners in a wide variety of ways, including by helping them determine which Companies might make the best customers, identify the contacts within those organizations by department, role or seniority that might improve or expedite their interactions with those Companies, and enabling them to personalize their interactions with those Companies.</p>
<p><strong>Clearbit Connect</strong></p>
<p>If you install Clearbit Connect, you make certain information and data available to us. For example, we will collect information about your web history and other electronic network activity information, such as IP address, in order to provide enriched company data based on the websites you visit.

Clearbit has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal information received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.

<p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Your Data Subject Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>The laws of your jurisdiction may give you the right to:</strong>  be informed, access, rectify, or erase any personal information we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal information we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal information (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us. If you choose to withdraw your consent, this will not impact the lawfulness of the data processing carried out up to that point.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set out below and specify which right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.

<p><strong>Protection and Retention of Information</strong></p>
<p>Clearbit considers the security of all the information and data within our control to be a top priority, and consistent with this we implement technical and organizational safeguards to protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such information or data. However, no security system is impenetrable, and unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are an unfortunate reality on the internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the information and data within our control, including personal information, is absolutely secure.</p>
<p>Clearbit retains the information described in this Privacy Policy for as long as is necessary to comply with legal obligations, enforce our agreements, maintain existing relationships with our customers, and otherwise as might be necessary for our legitimate business interests.</p>
