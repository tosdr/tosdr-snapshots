<p>In January 2024, Clearbit introduced new Clearbit Services. Clearbit will continue to provide existing customers with Legacy Clearbit Services under the Legacy Terms in an effort to support service continuity.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a new Clearbit customer as of January 2, 2024, the Clearbit Terms of Service available at <a href="https://clearbit.com/legal">https://clearbit.com/legal</a> (“Terms” or “Customer Terms”) apply to you.</p>
<p>Accordingly, existing Clearbit customers who accessed the Clearbit Services before January 2, 2024, (“Legacy Services”) will continue to renew Legacy Services under the Legacy Terms available at https://clearbit.com/legal/legacy which will apply to you instead.</p>
<h3>Customer Terms</h3>
<p>APIHub, Inc. dba Clearbit, a HubSpot Affiliate (&quot;Clearbit&quot; or “We”), provides Clearbit Services (defined below) subject to these terms. The effective date of these Terms is the earlier of the date you enter into these Terms and the date you first access the Clearbit Services.</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, if you are a Clearbit customer with access to Legacy Services, the Legacy Terms available at <a href="https://clearbit.com/legal/legacy">https://clearbit.com/legal/legacy</a> will apply to all of the services we provide to you instead.</p>
<p>By clicking or tapping any button or box marked &quot;Accept,&quot; Agree,&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; (or a similar term) in connection with these Terms, or by accessing our site <a href="https://clearbit.com/">https://clearbit.com</a> (&quot;Site&quot;) or otherwise using the Clearbit Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and affirm that you are over the age of 18. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind the entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the terms &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Your,&quot; or &quot;Customer&quot; shall refer to the entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms, you must not accept these Terms and may not use the Clearbit Services. You acknowledge that these Terms form a binding contract between you and Clearbit, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed, and that it governs without limitation your use of and access to the Clearbit Services, unless you have signed a separate Master Services Agreement or other similar with Clearbit.</p>
<p>PAID SUBSCRIPTION PLANS PURCHASED THROUGH SELF-SERVICE ON THE SITE OR THROUGH OUR RESELLERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNTIL YOU CANCEL THEM PURSUANT TO SECTION 5 OF THESE TERMS. CANCELING WILL END THE AUTOMATIC RENEWALS OF YOUR PAID SERVICES, BUT WE WILL KEEP ANY FEES WE HAVE ALREADY COLLECTED FROM YOU (UNLESS WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO REFUND THEM).</p>

<p>You hereby authorize and grant to Clearbit and its Affiliates a worldwide, limited, non-exclusive, perpetual license to use, store, process, transfer, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works of Customer Data for the purpose of providing the Clearbit Services and as otherwise authorized in these Terms.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer License to Customer Data and purpose described in this Section includes your authorization to share Customer Data with Clearbit and its Affiliates for other customers’ use in exchange for information that we hope is equally valuable to you through certain Clearbit Services.</p>
<p>As a result, your sharing of data with Clearbit and its Affiliates may amount to a “sale” of Personal Data under certain state statutes. Depending whether you are subject to those statutes (which may depend upon your company size, revenue, industry, etc.), such “sale” of information may require you to make specific disclosures or provide certain consumer “opt out” or other rights. We may provide you with materials or recommendations regarding how the Clearbit Services support your compliance with these requirements; if we do so, you understand that these are purely advisory in nature and are neither legal advice nor a substitute for legal advice. Therefore, you should consult legal counsel regarding requirements you may have under any such applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.</strong> <strong>Customer Data Obligations:</strong> You are responsible for (a) Customer Data, including the content, accuracy, and integrity of Customer Data and for correcting errors and omissions in Customer Data, and your secure transmission of such data to Clearbit, (b) any communications between You or any Authorized User and any individual contained within Product Data and (c) Your processing of Product Data, including compliance with Data Protection Laws (as defined in the DPA). You further represent and warrant that you have provided and will continue to provide adequate notices, and that you have obtained and will continue to maintain all necessary permissions, consents and opt-out mechanisms, as required by applicable laws, in order to lawfully collect and provide Customer Data to Clearbit for processing as contemplated by these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.</strong> <strong>Personal Data Obligations:</strong> The Clearbit Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) is hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. Each party shall comply with their respective obligations under the DPA with respect to any Personal Data transferred by one party to another as set forth in more detail in the DPA.</p>
<p><strong>3.4.</strong> <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Clearbit and its Affiliates may collect, use and analyze general information and data from its customers (including Customer Data) for purposes such as research, marketing, analysis, and benchmarking, and other purposes reasonably required to develop, deliver, and provide ongoing innovation to the Clearbit Services, provided that Clearbit does not specifically identify You or disclose any personally identifiable information in the course of collecting, using, analyzing, marketing or publishing such information or data. As between the parties, Clearbit and its Affiliates exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Usage Data.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.</strong> <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Customer acknowledges our Privacy Policy (available at: https://clearbit.com/privacy-policy or as Clearbit may otherwise indicate) sets out how we process personal data in connection with the Clearbit Services.</p>
<h5><strong>4. PAYMENT, TAXES</strong></h5>
<p><strong>4.1.</strong> <strong>Self-Service Subscriptions:</strong> All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in these terms. If you select a Subscription through the self-service process on the Site or through one of our Resellers, you will be required to provide Clearbit or its Affiliates information regarding your credit card or another payment instrument (“Payment Instrument”). You represent and warrant to Clearbit that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the Payment Instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date); we may also receive updates on your Payment Instrument through our payment service providers and automatically resume billing. If your Payment Instrument is declined when Clearbit or its Affiliates attempts to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If Clearbit or its Affiliates does not receive payment, Clearbit will promptly suspend or terminate the Customer’s Services. We assume no responsibility or liability if your access to the Subscription fails to renew or otherwise expires because of outdated or incorrect payment information.</p>
<p>Your Subscription will automatically renew each billing cycle on a recurring basis at which time your credit card will be charged automatically until you cancel your Subscription. You hereby authorize Clearbit or its Affiliates to bill your Payment Instrument for your monthly usage for the self-service Subscriptions entered into through the Site in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan referenced in the self-service Subscription or communicated to you by Clearbit from time to time, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred.</p>
<p><strong>4.2.</strong> <strong>Invoicing:</strong> If you purchase a Subscription through a separately executed Order, or if Clearbit elects to bill through an invoice, you will pay all fees charged by Clearbit for your use of Service in accordance with the Order. Clearbit or its Affiliates will invoice You for amounts due under these Terms (including for any product usage overages at rates set forth in the Order) and You will pay all undisputed Service Fees not subject to reasonable dispute within 30 days of receipt of invoice, except as otherwise specified in the applicable Order.</p>
<p>If Customer fails to pay any undisputed make payment of any amounts not subject to reasonable dispute when due, without limiting Clearbit’s other rights and remedies, after providing Customer with fifteen (15) days’ written notice of non-payment of any amount due: (a) Clearbit may suspend any and all Authorized User’s access to any or all Services until such amounts are paid in full; (b) Customer shall reimburse Clearbit for all reasonable costs incurred by Clearbit in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys’ fees; and (c) if such nonpayment failure continues, Clearbit may terminate suspend Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ access to the Service and this agreement in accordance with the Termination provision; Customer remains liable for all Fees agreed upon under these Terms.</p>
<p>Unless Customer identifies any disputed amounts within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice, such invoice shall be deemed undisputed. In the event of a dispute, the parties agree to work together in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the dispute is regarding a portion of an invoice, the undisputed portion shall remain due and payable in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>4.3.</strong> <strong>Credit Card Payments:</strong> If Customer provides Clearbit or its Affiliates with credit or debit card (“Payment Card”) details for the payment of fees stated herein (&quot;Fees&quot;), Customer: (a) represents that it is authorized to use such Payment Card; (b) authorizes Clearbit or its Affiliates to charge such Payment Card on a periodic basis for the Fees when due, including upon sign up for paid Services and upon renewal; (c) agrees to keep its Payment Card details valid and current; and (d) agrees to pay any processing fees that are charged by third-party payment processors or Payment Card issuers.</p>
<p>If Customer’s Payment Card is declined when Clearbit or its Affiliates attempts to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time (for example, if Customer’s Payment Card has expired or is no longer valid) and we reserve the right, and Customer authorizes Clearbit or its Affiliates, to retry billing Customer’s Payment Card. If Customer updates Payment Card information to remedy a change in validity or expiration date, we will automatically resume billing; we may also receive updates on Customer’s Payment Card through our payment service providers and automatically resume billing. If Clearbit does not receive payment, Clearbit may suspend or terminate Customer’s Services.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.</strong> <strong>Taxes:</strong> All Service Fees are exclusive of taxes. You agree to pay any taxes applicable to your use of the Services. You will have no liability for any taxes based upon our gross revenues or net income.</p>
<p>If you are required to deduct or withhold tax from payment, you may deduct this amount from the applicable Subscription Fee due to the extent it is due and payable as assessed withholding tax required under laws that apply to you (the “Deduction Amount”).</p>
<p>You will not be required to repay the Deduction Amount to us, provided that you present us with a valid tax receipt verifying payment of the Deduction Amount to the relevant tax authority within ninety (90) days from the date of the invoice. If you do not provide this tax receipt within the specified time period, then all fees, inclusive of the Deduction Amount, will be immediately due and payable, and failure to pay these fees may result in your account being suspended or terminated for non-payment.</p>
<p><strong>4.5.</strong> <strong>Purchase Orders:</strong> If Customer issues to Clearbit or its Affiliates a purchase order upon entering into an Order, any such purchase order is for Customer’s internal purposes only, and any terms in such purchase order are rejected by Clearbit, do not amend these Terms, and have no effect. If the Customer requests Clearbit to reference a purchase order number on a Clearbit invoice, such reference is included for administrative convenience only.</p>
