Our server also captures information about your visit to our site, such as the time and duration of your visit on each page on the site, and your navigation path from page to page (i.e., what you click on). We use third-party service providers such as Google Analytics, Segment, and Full Story to capture other information about your site visit, such as recordings of you scrolling activity on each page of our site.</p><p class=mb-6>We and our third-party analytics providers may place a cookie on your browser so that we may identify you as a return visitor if you visit our site more than once.

For example, we may ask an advertising service to target our ad to individuals that the ad service has identified as having a high interest in file upload management. If you arrive at our site by means of the link in that ad, we will be able to identify you as having a high interest in file upload management. Advertising services are responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of the data they provide to us in accordance with their published privacy policies.</p><p class=mb-6>See the section below captioned <a class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-500 underline" href=#advertising-ecosystem>Advertising Ecosystem</a> and <a class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-500 underline" href=#how-to-opt-out-of-online-data-collection>How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection</a>.</p><h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">Data provided by you as part of your communications with us</h3><p class=mb-6>We collect personal data that you submit to us as part of a communication with us as a visitor or account user, such as via chat on our site, email, submission of a web form, telephone, or in person (such as at a meeting, trade show or other event).

The communication may include information that can be used to identify you such as your name, job title, job function, the organization you represent, email address, phone number as well as information about your interest in our company or our services. We do not solicit information from you as part of these communications other than information that is useful to us in light of the purposes described above, but if you choose to volunteer more personal information than we ask for we will collect that as part of the communication.</p><h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">Data provided by you or your organization to establish and maintain the Filestack account and authorize service users</h3><p class=mb-6>Our customers are required to name a contact for billing, administrative, technical and other account related communications. We collect the name and business contact information of each account representative. Our customers also authorize service users. We require each individual account representative and service user to establish their own set of account credentials (user name and password). If the customer wishes to integrate their social media accounts with our services, we will require the customer to provide the account credentials used by their representatives on those platforms.</p><h3 class="text-xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-2">Marketing Partners and Resellers</h3><p class=mb-6>We have relationships with other companies that help us market, sell and deliver our services.

For example, we permit Google’s advertising services to collect data about your behavior on the Filestack site, as do many other website operators who use Google’s ad services. Google combines the data about an individual that it collects from different sources, and uses this aggregate data to sell advertising services that target the display of ads to web users who meet certain behavioral criteria. Google does not disclose this aggregate data to Filestack, but we are able to infer that visitors who interact with our ad meet the advertising criteria we provided. Google collects this data using cookies, web server logs (its own and its advertising customers), clear gifs and other online data collection techniques.
