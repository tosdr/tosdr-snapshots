Celsius will inform, update, and/or obtain your consent in advance, as applicable, in the event that a Third Party Custodian is used to provide the Custody Service to you. Celsius will use reasonable skill in the selection, appointment, and periodic review of Third Party Custodians. By using the Custody Service, you understand and agree to appoint Celsius or a Third Party Custodian selected by Celsius as your agent to store and secure Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet, and perform other duties customarily performed by a custodian. You understand that the Custody Service may be performed by a custodian in a jurisdiction other than where you are domiciled. By using the Custody Service, you authorize Celsius to transfer your Eligible Digital Assets to a Third Party Custodian or Custodians as may be selected by Celsius, and to instruct and cause any such Third Party Custodian to transfer your Eligible Digital Assets to another Third Party Custodian or Custodians as may be selected by Celsius, or to Celsius, in each case without the need for any further notice to or consent from you, and consistent with providing the Custody Services as set forth herein.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Title to any of your Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet shall at all times remain with you and not transfer to Celsius. Celsius will not transfer, sell, loan or otherwise rehypothecate Eligible Digital Assets held in a Custody Wallet unless specifically instructed by you, except as required by valid court order, competent regulatory agency, government agency or applicable law. As title owner of assets, you bear all risk of loss. Celsius shall have no liability for any Digital Asset price fluctuations or any or all loss of Digital Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Celsius may suspend your access to Services, including the Custody Service and your access to a Custody Wallet, in the event of market disruptions or periods of volatility. Celsius or a Third Party Custodian controls the private keys to the Blockchain addresses of all Custody Wallets.

You understand that your use of the Custody Service, whether provided by Celsius or a Third Party Custodian, does not create a fiduciary relationship between you and Celsius or any Third Party Custodian. Neither Celsius nor any Third Party Custodian has any fiduciary duty to you. Celsius has no duty to inquire into, supervise, or determine the suitability of any transaction you initiate involving Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet. Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet may be comingled with the Eligible Digital Assets of other Users, and Celsius is under no obligation to return the actual Eligible Digital Assets initially transferred by you to a Custody Wallet, but will return Eligible Digital Assets of the identical type reflected in your Celsius Account at the time you request such a return. Celsius may provide information regarding the Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet to comply with any applicable law, regulation, rule, or request by law enforcement or government agencies.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Eligible Digital Assets held in a Custody Wallet are subject to the other provisions of these Terms, unless where expressly stated otherwise. Celsius retains the right to set-off any Eligible Digital Assets in a Custody Wallet against any obligations you may have to us. You understand and acknowledge that the legal treatment of Digital Assets remains unsettled and may vary depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside. In the event that you, Celsius or any Third Party Custodian becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding, it is unclear how your Digital Assets would be treated and what rights you would have to such Digital Assets. Celsius does not make any representation as to the likely treatment of Digital Assets in your Celsius Account, including those in a Custody Wallet, in the event that you, Celsius or any Third Party Custodian becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding whether in the U.S. or in any other jurisdiction. You explicitly understand and acknowledge that the treatment of Digital Assets in the event of such an insolvency proceeding is unsettled, not guaranteed, and may result in a number of outcomes that are impossible to predict reliably, including but not limited to you being treated as an unsecured creditor and/or the total loss of any and all Digital Assets reflected in your Celsius Account, including those in a Custody Wallet.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Upon your instruction to Celsius to use one of the other Services detailed in this Section (such as, but not limited to, Swap, CelPay, and Borrow), or otherwise offered by Celsius, where such Services are available to you through your Account, the Eligible Digital Assets being used in such other Service may involve transferring your assets out of a Custody Wallet.

Celsius may choose to add, remove, change, or impose any additional limits on Supported Pairs from time to time, in its sole discretion and without providing prior notice.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">By using Celsius’ Swap Service, you will allow Celsius to exchange the type and amount of the Digital Asset in your Celsius Account that you choose to swap (the<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Swapped Assets”</strong>) into the type of Digital Asset you choose to receive (the<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“New Assets”</strong>).

Exchange Rates</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">Celsius will use reasonable efforts to source the best rate for a Supported Pair across multiple venues. However, we cannot guarantee that the Exchange Rates offered on our platform would always be optimal, and you understand and acknowledge that Celsius is not under any obligation to provide the best rate for a Supported Pair. You further acknowledge that it is your responsibility to check if a better rate is available on another platform. In line with Celsius’ commitment to transparency, the Exchange Rates quoted may include an offset from the prevailing market rate (also known as “spread”) to mitigate both Celsius’ exposure to price volatility between the time the Exchange Rate is confirmed and the time the transaction is executed. The spread may be set by Celsius and/or third party vendors working with Celsius to complete the Swap transaction.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">Exchange Rates available on our platform are moment-in-time specific, and due to the volatility in crypto markets, change constantly and rapidly. An Exchange Rate is only final when you approve the transaction and it has been accepted and confirmed.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer cIhqKS">iii. Swap Transactions are Final</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">All Swap transactions are final and irreversible once approved by you.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">You should therefore carefully review the terms of each transaction before you approve it.

Execution</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">Each Swap transaction is entered into between you and Celsius (as buyer or seller, as applicable), and Celsius does not act as your broker, agent, or intermediary.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">By entering into any Swap transaction, you hereby appoint Celsius or a Third Party Custodian to act as the custodian of the Swapped Assets for the purpose of exchanging those assets, and for the duration necessary to complete the exchange.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">During periods of high volume, illiquidity, or volatility in the marketplace for any Digital Asset, the actual market rate at which trade is executed may be different from the prevailing rate indicated at the time of your order or trade. You acknowledge and agree that Celsius is not liable for any such price fluctuations. In the event of periods of high volume, illiquidity, or volatility in the marketplace for any Digital Asset or other market disruption of any kind or Force Majeure event (see further Section 34 below, “Force Majeure”), Celsius may suspend access to the Swap Service and/or prevent you from completing any actions via the Swap Service.

The nature of Digital Assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by Celsius or third parties may limit, delay or prevent the access or use of Digital Assets and/or cause losses of Digital Assets. Although Celsius takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber threats, circumstances may arise where losses or damages are incurred.<!-- --> </p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">In light of these risks, which are only some of the risks involved in using the Services and holding or trading in Digital Assets, and do not constitute an exhaustive list of such risks, you should carefully consider whether holding or trading Digital Assets in general and/or using our Services is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</p><p class="sc-aXZVg dnSgsa">11. Withdrawals<!-- --> </p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Subject to these Terms, for any of your Eligible Digital Assets that you elect to utilize in the Earn Service (if available to you), you have a call option on all loans made to Celsius to demand immediate, complete or partial repayment of any loan at any time through (i) transfer to a Custody Wallet, if available to you, or (ii) a complete or partial withdrawal of Eligible Digital Assets at any time. Such repayment will terminate in whole or in part your loan to Celsius and you shall no longer accrue Rewards on the amount of loans as of the time of your exercise of the call option. Celsius initiates the withdrawal process immediately following a withdrawal request when possible; however, we may require up to three (3) days after you submit your withdrawal request to process the withdrawal.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">For every withdrawal request, you will be required to provide the details of the Virtual Wallet to which you wish to receive your repayment of Digital Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, any repayment shall be in-kind (i.e., in the same type of Eligible Digital Assets loaned by you, but not the actual same Digital Assets originally transferred by you). In the event that the details you provide are inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, your Digital Assets may be permanently lost. We will not be liable for any loss that results from inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading details that you may provide for such transfer. If the transfer address you specify is one to which we are unable to process transfers, we will have no liability for any resulting failure or delay in processing your requested withdrawal.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Celsius and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of transactions either temporarily or permanently. Provided that Celsius has taken reasonable commercial and operational measures to prevent such events in technical systems controlled by Celsius, Celsius is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transactions. Withdrawal limits based on amounts and/or frequency may apply from time to time, based on legal, regulatory, AML and/or security considerations. Our policies and procedures may require additional security and/or compliance checks that require additional time to complete. Any individual request to exceed withdrawal limits set by Celsius must be sent via email to app@celsius.network.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Every transmission request shall be deemed pending until accepted by us. We may refuse to accept such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to inaccurate or misleading information provided by you, or any doubt or suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation, a sanctioned transaction, money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crime related to your Celsius Account.</p><p class="sc-aXZVg dnSgsa">12. How Rewards Are Calculated and Earned</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">All Eligible Digital Assets that you elect to utilize in the Earn Service (if available to you) and thus are loaned to Celsius (1) are not being used as collateral for Loans, (2) have not had all rights in connection with them assigned to another Celsius user using CelPay, and (3) were not requested for external transmission or withdrawal (Eligible Digital Assets meeting each of these three criteria,<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Loaned Digital Assets”</strong>) entitle you to Rewards while credited to your Celsius Account.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">We periodically update our rates and the rate changes are made in our sole discretion. Rewards will be payable in arrears and added to the principal loaned by you to Celsius, as part of the Earn Service, and reflected in your Celsius Account balance weekly.<!-- --> </p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">We calculate the Rewards on Loaned Digital Assets based on market demand for each Eligible Digital Asset.<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">Reward rates are not determined based on Celsius’ income or profit, generated directly or indirectly as a result of the use by Celsius of a particular Digital Asset, a type of Digital Assets, or otherwise.<!-- --> </strong></p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">Rewards are payable based on a daily periodic rate applicable to the Loaned Digital Assets. The daily periodic rate is calculated by dividing the then-applicable annual reward rate by three hundred sixty-four (364) days; then it is further divided down to the hour, minute, and second of that day. Loaned Digital Assets, including those received as Rewards from previous weeks, will begin gaining Rewards according to the hour, minute, and second on the timestamp verifying the completion of the applicable transaction and shall cease and/or decrease the amount paid as Rewards at the moment when the User has entered an external transmission, withdrawal or transfer of rights (via CelPay) request, or posted any Loaned Digital Assets as collateral for a Loan. Therefore, any Loaned Digital Asset that you elect to utilize in the Earn Service (if available to you) mid-week will receive Rewards with no distinction, based on the rates calculated for the relative time within the allocation period.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">We will reflect the Rewards earned for the previous week on or around the first business day of each week, through our platform. Your Celsius Account must be active on the date the Rewards are payable for you to receive the applicable Rewards. All Rewards will be added to your Celsius Account balance in-kind (in the same Eligible Digital Asset that is reflected in your Celsius Account) or, subject to your in-app choice and regulatory and business considerations, in CEL. Once Rewards are added to your Celsius Account balance, they shall be treated as an integral part of your Eligible Digital Assets, you shall be deemed to have elected to utilize in the Earn Service (if available to you), including with respect to such Rewards, which shall thus be loaned to Celsius, for all purposes. To make such in-kind Reward payments as accurate as possible, Celsius rounds non-integer, rational numbers to the sub-cent, which is the smallest possible decimal available for the applicable Eligible Digital Asset.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">For users who are citizens or legal residents of the United States, Celsius requires your Taxpayer ID (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) to be updated in your Celsius Account in order to gain Rewards. Celsius is not obligated to reflect credits in your Celsius Account retroactively with Rewards that would have been gained if you had otherwise updated your profile with your TIN or SSN.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">If Celsius has determined, in its sole and absolute discretion, that for any regulatory or legal reason we are limited in the Rewards rate we may offer you on your Eligible Digital Assets loaned to Celsius (or if we are completely restricted from paying any Rewards to you whatsoever), the Rewards to which you shall be entitled will be limited accordingly. Based on our reasonable interpretation of legal requirements, without prior notice, we may limit the Rewards to which you will be entitled.<!-- --> </p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">If, at any time, for legal or other reasons, a Celsius Account is suspended or frozen by Celsius, Loaned Digital Assets connected to such Celsius Account shall not be eligible to earn Rewards.<!-- --> </p><p class="sc-aXZVg dnSgsa">13. Consent to Celsius’ Use of Digital Assets</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">In consideration for the Rewards payable to you on the Eligible Digital Assets using the Earn Service, for us entering into any Loan Agreement, and the use of our Services, you grant Celsius, subject to applicable law and for the duration of the period during which you elect to utilize the Eligible Digital Assets in the Earn Service (if available to you) and thus loan such Eligible Digital Assets to us through your Celsius Account, or as collateral under the Borrow Service (if available to you), all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets, including ownership rights, and the right, without further notice to you, to hold such Digital Assets in Celsius’ own Virtual Wallet or elsewhere, and to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time, and without retaining in Celsius’ possession and/or control a like amount of Digital Assets or any other monies or assets, and to use or invest such Digital Assets in Celsius’ full discretion. You acknowledge that with respect to Digital Assets used by Celsius pursuant to this paragraph:</p><ol class="sc-dBmzty gwGoST"><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">You will not be able to exercise rights of ownership;<!-- --> </p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">Celsius may receive compensation in connection with lending or otherwise using Digital Assets in its business to which you have no claim or entitlement; and</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">In the event that Celsius becomes bankrupt, enters liquidation or is otherwise unable to repay its obligations, any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable, and you may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius’ obligations to you other than your rights as a creditor of Celsius under any applicable laws.</p></li></ol><p class="sc-aXZVg dnSgsa">14. Hard Forks and Airdrops</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">Any Blockchain may undergo software updates from time to time, which will result in a permanent divergence in the Blockchain (a<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Hard Fork”</strong>). The result is that such Blockchain will split into two separate and distinct Blockchains, and any Digital Asset on that original Blockchain may entitle its holders to a new type of Digital Asset (the<!-- --> <strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Forked Asset”</strong>). You agree and understand that the support of any Forked Asset in your Celsius Account is solely at the discretion of Celsius. If we do not make a public announcement confirming our support of a Forked Asset ahead of an anticipated Hard Fork, we will not support the Forked Asset and such Forked Asset will be an unsupported Digital Asset (<strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Unsupported Assets”</strong>), in which case all Celsius Accounts will be denominated in the legacy Digital Asset and all Rewards will accrue and be payable in the legacy Digital Asset. You agree that Celsius assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to those Unsupported Assets and you will not be able to recover the Unsupported Assets from Celsius. Celsius assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever with respect to Unsupported Assets.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">In the event that a Hard Fork achieves the required consensus, it is possible that we will only support the Forked Asset and will discontinue our support of the legacy Digital Asset. In the event of a Hard Fork that entitles you to a Forked Asset, you are advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from your Celsius Account prior to the relevant date for the Hard Fork. Celsius is not obligated in any way to monitor or maintain balances of Forked Asset issued to holders of the applicable Digital Assets upon a Hard Fork, or to credit you for the value of such Forked Asset. In the event you wish to receive Forked Asset issued upon a Hard Fork, you are advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Asset from your Celsius Account prior to the relevant date for the Hard Fork. All determinations regarding Hard Forks shall be made by Celsius in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">In the event that a Digital Asset network attempts to or does distribute Digital Assets to Blockchain addresses pertaining to an Eligible Digital Asset via airdrop or bootstrapping (collectively, an “Airdrop”), the support of any such new Digital Assets in your Celsius Account is solely at the discretion of Celsius. If we do not make a public announcement confirming our support of such new Digital Assets, we will not support such new Digital Assets and such new Digital Assets will be treated as Unsupported Assets. To the extent you wish to receive the new Digital Assets to be delivered via Airdrop, you are advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from your Celsius Account prior to the relevant date for the Airdrop. You further agree and understand that Digital Assets delivered via Airdrop do not create or represent any relationship between us and the sender and/or the related Digital Asset network and do not subject us to any obligations whatsoever as they relate to the sender and/or the related Digital Asset network.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer eXITwG">All determinations regarding the Forked Assets and/or Digital Assets delivered via Airdrop will be made by Celsius in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="sc-aXZVg dnSgsa">15. CelPay</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">CelPay is Celsius’ proprietary Digital Asset tool for Celsius Users, which allows you to transfer ownership or assign your rights with Celsius, as applicable, in connection with selected Eligible Digital Assets to other registered Celsius Users.</p><p class="sc-gEvEer icaJQN">By using our CelPay feature, you understand and acknowledge that:</p><ol class="sc-dBmzty gwGoST"><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">you are transferring your ownership to, or assigning your rights in, the Eligible Digital Assets you select when using CelPay, and that such transfers of ownership or assignment of rights may not be recorded on any Blockchain, but rather on Celsius’ ledger;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">by making any CelPay transaction, you are authorizing Celsius to deduct the corresponding amount of Eligible Digital Assets from your Celsius Account balance, and to transfer or credit such amount to the balance of the receiving User’s Celsius Account;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">Celsius is not responsible, and will not interfere in any way in, any dispute between you and the User involved in the CelPay transaction;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">if you initiate a CelPay transaction to an unintended or incorrect User, you may irrevocably lose your rights in connection with the said Eligible Digital Assets, and it is your sole responsibility to make sure you provide the correct details when initiating a CelPay transaction;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">the completion of a CelPay transaction may not be immediate, and it may take some time before such transaction is processed and the relevant Celsius Account balances are updated;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">use of the CelPay feature is subject to limitations on amounts transacted, as determined in Celsius’ sole discretion from time to time;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">all transactions made through CelPay are final and irreversible;</p></li><li><p class="sc-gEvEer iMhVAB">by making any CelPay transaction you represent to Celsius that you are familiar with the person to whom the transaction is made, and that such transaction is not made for any illicit or illegal purpose.

In the event of irregular activity, we may hold assets until we close your Celsius Account. Any Digital Assets that Celsius returns to you will be sent to the designated withdrawal addresses in your user profile on the Celsius platform for each respective Digital Asset you hold. Celsius Accounts are not transferable or assignable in whole or in part. Celsius may be required by law to turn over any Digital Assets related to abandoned or unclaimed Celsius Accounts to the state of your last known residence (<strong class="sc-iMWBiJ gVfKWk">“Escheatment”</strong>).

In the event any Digital Asset ceases to be an Eligible Digital Asset, you will no longer be entitled to receive any Rewards in connection with our Earn Service (if available to you), or otherwise make any other use of it via our Services. We may choose to disallow the use of any Eligible Digital Asset for certain Services, or treat any Digital Asset as an Eligible Digital Asset for certain Users or groups of Users for certain Services, in our sole discretion.

If third parties make claims on your Celsius Account, or if we receive conflicting instructions from you, or if we become involved in or concerned about a dispute between you and any third party, we reserve the right to react in ways that we believe in good faith to be appropriate, including by closing, suspending or freezing your Celsius Account, delivering the Digital Assets available therein to you or to any third party, or interpleading assets to court, all as we reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances.

For example, if you select an Ethereum Virtual Wallet Address to receive assets, you shall be solely responsible to assure that you are initiating a transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. Celsius incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to non- Eligible Digital Assets sent to Celsius, or for Eligible Digital Assets sent to an incompatible Virtual Wallet Address.

Regardless of the terms of such Legal Process, we have first claim to any and all assets in your Celsius Account. We will not contest any Legal Process on your behalf, and we may take actions to comply with Legal Process without liability to you, provided that we reasonably believe any such action is appropriate under the circumstances. If we incur any expenses in connection with any Legal Process, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, we may charge such expenses and fees to any of your Celsius Accounts without prior notice to you, or we may bill you directly for such expenses and fees.
