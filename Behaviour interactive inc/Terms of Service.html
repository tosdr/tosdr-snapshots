Account</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>A.     Opening &amp; Maintaining Account</strong></em></p><p>While some BHVR Services may be generally accessed by the public, certain aspects of the Website (e.g. posting in the forums) and the use of certain BHVR Services requires you to create an account (the “<strong>Account</strong>”). If you have questions about registration for an Account, please contact us at <a href="https://support.bhvr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.bhvr.com</a>.</p><p>Only “natural persons,” as opposed to any kinds of legal entities (e.g., corporations, limited liability companies, and/or partnerships), shall have the privilege of establishing an Account. By entering into this Agreement and creating an Account, you represent that you are an adult and have the legal capacity to enter into a contract in the jurisdiction where you reside. You agree to comply with this Agreement on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, any minor children for whom you are the parent or legal guardian and whom you have authorized to play the Game using your Account and/or authorized to use the Website. You further agree that you are entirely liable for all activities conducted through your Account, and are responsible for ensuring that you and/or your child is aware of, understands, and complies with the terms of this Agreement and any and all other Overall Terms.</p><p>To create an Account, you must have an email address, and provide truthful and accurate information. Please note that in utilizing certain areas of the Website (e.g. purchasing certain merchandise), you will be requested to provide additional information such as your name, full address and in some cases, payment information. You must be eligible to use the BHVR Service for which you are registering. Some BHVR Services require the creation of a “username” or a “persona.” Usernames and personas are tied to your Account. You may not use a username or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise violates the Terms of Use. BHVR reserves the right to block or remove any username or persona, if the use thereof violates the Terms of Use, any Overall Terms, laws or regulations, including, without limitation, personality rights, or trademarks.</p><p>You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account including purchases, whether or not authorized by you. Your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Use or is otherwise improper or illegal. You should not reveal your Account password to others. BHVR will not ask you to reveal your password, or initiate contact with you asking for answers to your password security questions.</p><p>We follow generally accepted rules in the video game industry, as well as applicable regulations to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. We strive to use appropriate organizational and technical means to safeguard the security of your personal information, however, no security measures are 100% effective. In the event you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your personal information , you must immediately notify BHVR by emailing <a href="https://support.bhvr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.bhvr.com</a>. In addition, submissions made via e-mail are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.</p><p><em><strong>B.      Specific Terms for a Single Account</strong></em></p><p>BHVR may, at its discretion, allow you to open one single account (“<strong>Single Account</strong>”) which may be connected across different platforms including without limitation Steam, Nintendo Switch and Stadia (the “<strong>Platform(s)</strong>”) which shall enable cross-progression within a Game across said Platforms. Once one Platform is connected to a Single Account, you may only be able to add or remove a unique account from such Platform to the Single Account. Should you wish to modify the Platform account linked to the Single Account, you may do so only at the frequency detailed on the Website applicable to the Game.</p><p>If you make a purchase of a limited license to use a Virtual Good on a Platform, you will be able to access it from all Platforms connected to your Single Account, except for certain Virtual Goods which are subject to licensing restrictions, and except for Game Currency. The Game Currency is non-transferable from one Platform to another.</p><p>Further, in the event you choose to disconnect one of your Platforms from the Single Account (“<strong>Platform Disconnection</strong>”), you acknowledge and agree that (i) you may lose the progression within the Game that happened while such Platform was linked to the Single Account, and that (ii) the Virtual Goods acquired and/or purchased on such Platform while it was linked to the Single Account may be lost after such Platform Disconnection.

You will be asked to provide to BHVR certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the Pre-Release Games and/or any other Content or Games. This process is referred to herein as a “<strong>Play Test</strong>”. If it is a closed Play Test, BHVR may ask you to enter into a confidentiality agreement (“<strong>Confidentiality Agreement</strong>”) for each specific Play Test BEFORE you are allowed to be a tester (“<strong>Tester</strong>”) and BEFORE any software is provided or made accessible to you. In such case, your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, in addition to the following terms and conditions which apply to all Pre-Release Tests and/or to Play Test terms which you must accept prior to participating in such a test. Furthermore, as a participant, you have to comply with all the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and all rules applicable to Play Tests.</p><p>In connection with the Play Test, BHVR may provide you, on a temporary basis, Pre-Release Games, as well as any other Games, Content, and/or confidential and proprietary information (collectively, “<strong>Pre-Release Materials</strong>”).

You agree as a condition of participating in a Play Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the Pre-Release Materials, (ii) safeguard the Pre-Release Materials and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the Pre-Release Materials, and (iii) if applicable, fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.</p><p>You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to Pre-Release Materials to any other person. You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to BHVR, and BHVR is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations. Your obligation to keep the Pre-Release Materials confidential will continue until BHVR publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, the Pre-Release Materials and the Content that you are testing.</p><p>Upon request, you agree to immediately delete all copies of the Pre-Release Material which BHVR provided to you.</p><p>Nothing in these Terms of Use or any other Overall Terms shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the Pre-Release Materials or other Content. The Pre-Release Games are provided for testing on an “as is” and “as available” basis and BHVR makes no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.</p><p>By participating in a Play Test, you agree that: (I) playing Pre-Release Games is at your own risk and you know that the Pre-Release Games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) BHVR has no obligation to make these Pre-Release Games available for play with or without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) BHVR’s Terms of Use, Play Test specific terms and Privacy Policy apply to your use of the Pre-Release Games during the testing phase, and (v) if it is a closed Play Test, you will keep all information about the Pre-Release Materials confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.</p><p>Play Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>VII.

BHVR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE CHANGES.</p><p><em><strong>D.     Links to Third-Party Websites</strong></em></p><p>BHVR Services may include hyperlinks to websites operated by third parties including advertisers and other content providers.
