					If you register for a particular event or program, we will share your information with the
					applicable host organisation, governing body, club or event organiser for that event or program, and
					with any other party which furthers the purpose of your registration. These parties are authorized
					to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We will use or
					disclose your information for a secondary purpose only if you have consented or if you would
					reasonably expect us to do so or if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
					legal process. In certain situations, SPay, Inc. may be required to disclose Personal Information in
					response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
					enforcement requirements. If SPay is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion
					of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change
					in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding
					your Personal Information.</p>
				<p>We may use your Personal Information for the purposes of our own direct marketing, however we will
					ensure you have an ability to opt out of future such communications by following the unsubscribe
					instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d5a6a0a5a5baa7a195a7b0b2b4a1a1b4b6b0bba1a7b4b9fbb6bab8">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
				<p>We will also send you service related email announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to
					do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an
					email. You do not have an option to opt out of these emails, which are not promotional in nature.
				</p>
				<h5>Disclosure to overseas recipients.</h5>
				<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to overseas recipients such as host organisations,
					governing bodies, clubs or event organisers which may be located in Australia, Canada, England,
					Germany, Belgium, Italy or the United States of America when you have sought our assistance to
					participate in an event or program or where disclosure is required for verification purposes. As
					such, the location of these overseas recipients will depend on the specific events or programs to
					which you apply or where such verification is required.</p>
				<p>The information disclosed to overseas recipients consists of any information you have given to us to
					provide the relevant services. By accepting services from us, you consent to us providing your
					Personal Information to the relevant overseas recipient as mentioned above and acknowledge that we
					are not responsible for ensuring their compliance with the applicable privacy laws.</p>

			<section>
				<h4 id="part-5">5. The steps we take to protect and keep secure the Personal Information we hold.</h4>
				<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we hold against interference, loss,
					unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and other misuse.</p>
				<h5>The steps we take include:</h5>
				<ul class="rc-list-ul">
					<li>maintenance of computer and network security measures such as including firewalls, use of
						password and other appropriate measures where information is held in electronic form;</li>
					<li>regular updates to security systems to protect our systems from malicious software;</li>
					<li>restriction of access to data to only those staff that need access to carry out our business
						activities;</li>
					<li>training and ensuring that all our employees are required, as a condition of employment, to
						treat Personal Information held by us as confidential;</li>
					<li>whenever we collect Sensitive information such as credit card data, that information is
						encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way using secure socket layer technology (SSL). You
						can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking
						for ‘https’ at the beginning of the address of the web page.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You should however, be aware that if you submit information to us electronically the internet is not
					a secure environment. We take reasonable steps to provide a secure channel for receiving information
					but cannot absolutely protect Personal Information before it reaches us. If you have any questions
					about security on our website, you can contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c2f292c2c332e281c2e393b3d28283d3f3932282e3d30723f3331"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c2f292c2c332e281c2e393b3d28283d3f3932282e3d30723f3331">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
				<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
					services. When the Personal Information that we collect is no longer required, we will destroy,
					delete it in a secure manner, or ensure that the information is de-identified in accordance with our
					information destruction and de-identification policy, unless we are required by law to retain a copy
					of the Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
					enforce our agreements.</p>

			<section>
				<h4 id="part-6">6. How individuals can access and correct their Personal Information held by us.</h4>
				<p>You have the right to seek access to any of your Personal Information held by us unless there is a
					valid reason under an applicable privacy law for us to withhold the information.</p>
				<h5>Valid reasons include where:</h5>
				<ul class="rc-list-ul">
					<li>we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity or misconduct of a serious nature has been
						engaged in and giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in
						relation to the matter; or</li>
					<li>giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within us in connection with a
						commercially sensitive process; or</li>
					<li>giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals; or</li>
					<li>giving access would be unlawful.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Upon request, SPay will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal
					information. If your personal details change, or you believe the information we hold about you is
					incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us so that we can correct our records or you
					can make the change on your Account Information page.</p>
				<p>Requests for access, deletion or correction to Personal Information should be addressed to the SPay
					Inc. Privacy Officer. All requests for access, deletion or correction to Personal Information will
					be responded to in writing within a reasonable period of time. As part of this process we will
					verify the identity of the individual requesting the information prior to providing access or making

					provide reasons for our refusal.</p>
