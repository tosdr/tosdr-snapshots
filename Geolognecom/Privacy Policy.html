        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    </header>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the privacy of information supplied by users or
        collected by us from users of this web site or from other third parties. Because we want to
        build users' trust and confidence in our privacy practices, we want to disclose them to
        you.<br/>

        <br/>

        <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement </strong><br/>

        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement,
        the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we
        collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br/>

        We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it
        frequently.&nbsp; If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email,
        or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Registration Newsletter/ Frequency of Mailings </strong><br/>

        By registering to our newsletter, you are agreeing to receive our newsletters on a daily basis.
        <strong>geologne.com </strong> has the right to change frequency of delivery of its newsletters
        without notice. </p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Collection and Use of information </strong><br/>

        We respect your right to privacy. <strong>geologne.com </strong> received your information from
        your submission to us or through one of our affiliates.<strong> geologne.com </strong> is the
        owner of the information that you provided in any registration process. Your email address and
        any other identifying information that you give us will not be revealed to any third party,
        including any of the direct marketers who may use us to pass offers to you. </p>

    <p align="justify">We use the information that you provided primarily to send you our newsletters.
        Moreover, the information subscribers give us is sometimes used to send prizes, verify legal
        age, and to send third-party mailings based on the interests that each individual subscriber has
        opted-in for. We may also collect and report to third parties (such as affiliates, content and
        service providers, and advertisers) aggregated information from our web site. For example, we
        may aggregate and report to third parties that X people purchased a particular product during a
        month, or that Y% of visitors to this web site are between the ages 25-34. </p>

    <p align="justify">From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests
        or surveys on our site.&nbsp; If you participate, we will request certain personally
        identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
        voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp;
        The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping
        address), and demographic information (such as zip code). </p>

    <p align="justify">As is true of most web sites, we also gather certain information automatically
        and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
        browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
        stamp, and click stream data.&nbsp;We use this information, which does not identify individual
        users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and
        to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp;We do link this
        automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information like IP addresses and email
        addresses. However, this is solely for internal uses and used to verify appropriate registration
        methods. </p>

    <p align="justify">Finally, <strong>geologne.com </strong> may disclose subscriber information in
        response to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes. </p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Children </strong><br/>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable) </strong><br/>

        We maintain the right to share aggregated demographic information about our subscriber base with
        our partners and advertisers.&nbsp; This information does not identify individual subscribers.&nbsp;
        We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. </p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Third-Party Links </strong><br/>

        For your convenience, our newsletter contains links to third-party web sites that are not owned

        We use certain efforts to secure our web site. We will periodically review our security policies

        web site, you can send an email </p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Business Transitions </strong><br/>

        In the event <strong>geologne.com </strong> goes through a business transition, such as a merger,

        identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.&nbsp; You will be notified
        via prominent notice on our web site prior to any such change in ownership or control of your
        personal information. </p>

    <p align="justify"><strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong><br/>

        If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out
        of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or
        by emailing us </p>
