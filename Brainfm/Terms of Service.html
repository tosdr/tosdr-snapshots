All Subscription purchases are subject to this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions, including any fees, imposed by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier, as applicable. You are solely responsible for reviewing the terms of use, privacy policy or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier. By providing a Payment Method in connection with any Subscription, you hereby authorize Brain.FM to debit the total cost of said Subscription and agree to be responsible for any foreign transaction charges associated with your Subscription purchase. Should charges for which you are responsible fail at the time payment is required, you will be responsible for costs associated with Brain.FM’s efforts to collect amounts due. You represent and promise to us that all information you provide in connection with the purchase of a Subscription is true, accurate and complete. The duration and cost of Subscriptions are set by Brain.FM in its sole discretion.

You also agree that the amount billed may be different if your original Subscription was purchased using a promotional/trial offer and you authorize Brain.FM to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts as indicated at the time of sign-up, and any other charges, including any foreign transaction charge, that you may incur in connection with your use of the Subscription. Your Subscription will remain in effect and continue to renew automatically until it is cancelled.<p>IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL, you may do so by visiting your account overview page, clicking on “Membership” and then clicking “Cancel your membership.” Brain.FM will make reasonable efforts to process cancellation requests within two business days from the receipt of the cancellation request.
