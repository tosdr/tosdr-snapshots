            These Merchant Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern the use of the products, services or any other features,
            technologies or functionalities related to merchant payment acceptance services (the "Acceptance
            Services") provided by BitPay (“BitPay”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) through BitPay’s website, API or
            through any other means to you (“Merchant”, “you” or “your”). By using the Acceptance Services, you accept
            these Terms and agree to be bound by them, confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted all of the
            provisions contained herein, including, without limitation, Section 18.7, Governing Law; Arbitration;

            BitPay is a blockchain/cryptocurrency payment processor that enables you to accept cryptocurrencies as a
            payment method in exchange for goods or services you sell to your customers (“Shoppers”).
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay is not a cryptocurrency exchange, nor does it provide cryptocurrency custody as part of the
            Acceptance Services. The Acceptance Services are only available to businesses that sell products or
            services and registered charitable organizations that accept donations.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            By using the Acceptance Services, you authorize BitPay to act as your agent and to take any and all
            actions that we think are necessary or desirable to provide the Acceptance Services and to comply with
            applicable laws and regulations. Payment by a Shopper to BitPay is considered the same as payment made
            directly to you and limits the Shopper's outstanding obligations to the extent of the payment.

            BitPay B.V. is regulated by the Dutch Central Bank pursuant to Section 23b(1) of the Wwft. As such, we are
            required to collect certain information from Merchants to comply with anti-money laundering and
            anti-terrorist funding laws and regulations. Therefore, as part of establishing a BitPay Merchant Account,
            at a minimum you will be asked to submit business-related information such as name, mailing address,
            physical address, phone number, email address, information relating to the ultimate beneficial owner(s) or

            The information you provide at the time of opening the Account must be accurate and complete, and you
            must inform us within ten (10) business days of any changes to such information. BitPay has the right to
            reject your Account registration, to later close your Account, or to restrict the provision of the
            Acceptance Services to you if you do not provide and maintain accurate, complete and satisfactory
            information.

            BitPay imposes daily and annual transaction processing volume limits per Account. If you wish to increase
            your limit, you will be required to apply for an upgrade from your Account dashboard (“Dashboard”) and
            provide us with documentation necessary to qualify for that upgrade. Depending on the upgrade request,
            you may be required to provide additional information and documentation. Requests will not be approved
            until all required documentation has been reviewed and the accuracy and authenticity of the information
            has been confirmed. A description of the processing limits and the upgrade process is available in our

            Shoppers sending cryptocurrency payments and Merchants receiving settlements in cryptocurrency need to
            have a digital wallet. A digital wallet is a piece of software enabling a user to store encrypted private
            keys, used to sign transactions to access funds. A custodial digital wallet constitutes an account where
            third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of a user’s cryptocurrencies. A custodial
            wallet provider stores the user’s private keys and thus has control over the user’s funds. A non-custodial
            digital wallet does not constitute an account where third parties serve as financial intermediaries or
            custodians of a user’s cryptocurrencies. A non-custodial wallet provider administers only the technical
            platform to store a user’s private keys, but has no control over or access to the private keys, and
            therefore no control over or access to the user’s funds.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Shoppers and Merchants may use any cryptocurrency wallet to store their funds, including the BitPay
            wallet. BitPay does not endorse or vouch for the quality or security of any third-party wallets. The
            wallet owner is solely responsible for safekeeping passwords and private keys used to access their wallet,
            as well as maintaining the security protocols and updates on devices used to download and use their
            wallet. If a Shopper or Merchant chooses to use the BitPay wallet, they do so subject to the BitPay Wallet
            Terms of Use.
          </p> <p class="legal-terms__italic" data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay is not responsible for, and cannot assist with recovery of, a loss of cryptocurrency funds incurred
            by a Merchant or Shopper if a wallet is compromised, for example due to loss of or unauthorized access to
            private keys, accidental sharing of a backup, a bug in the user’s device or the wallet software, or a
            malicious attack on the wallet software.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            In the event your account balance gets settled to a wallet that becomes compromised or inaccessible, or in
            the event a Shopper’s wallet becomes compromised or inaccessible, it is up to you to decide how to handle
            any inquiries or potential claims. BitPay does not get involved in resolving such issues.

            In order to accept a cryptocurrency payment, you need to create a payment request (“Invoice”) using the
            Acceptance Services, based on the amount you want to collect in your settlement currency, such as U.S.
            Dollars or Euros, or in any of the supported cryptocurrencies. BitPay's hosted invoice user interface must
            be displayed to the Shopper during checkout.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            When BitPay processes payments, we use BitPay’s Best Bid (“BBB”) rate. We guarantee the exchange rate for
            the Shopper as long as the Shopper pays within the proper time window after the Invoice is created.
            Invoice timeout information is clearly displayed on each BitPay Invoice. For more information about how
            BitPay calculates exchange rates and factors in market depth, please refer to
            <a rel="noreferrer noopener" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="https://bitpay.com/exchange-rates" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>

            </a></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            While we guarantee the exchange rate for the Shopper as long as the Shopper pays within such time window,
            you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your settlement currency. For example, if you ask us to
            collect U.S. $150.00 and the Shopper sends the cryptocurrency equivalent within the time window, we guarantee
            you will receive exactly U.S. $150.00, minus our fee, but we do not guarantee the future value of the U.S.
            Dollar (or any other fiat currency) relative to any benchmark. Similarly, if you elect to receive some or
            all of your settlement in cryptocurrency, we do not guarantee the future value of that cryptocurrency
            relative to any benchmark.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.2 Invoice Completion</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            An Invoice is considered “complete” by us if it has been fully paid by the Shopper, the corresponding
            transaction has reached our required number of block confirmations, and the payment has been credited to
            your Account ledger.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            The number of confirmations required for a transaction depends on several factors, including the
            blockchain being used and our internal analysis of risk. We employ risk mitigation techniques to detect
            fraudulent payments, such as payments that are at risk of never receiving the required number of block
            confirmations. However, these measures do not completely eliminate the risk associated with unconfirmed
            payments.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            A confirmed Invoice means that payment has been made and the required block confirmations have occurred,
            such that the transaction has passed our risk validation measures, but it still needs to be credited to
            your Account ledger. For more information about how block confirmations and Invoice completion works, see

            You have the option to inform your Shopper that you have accepted the Invoice as paid before BitPay deems
            the Invoice completed, e.g. an Invoice payment that is not confirmed.
            BitPay is not liable for settling Invoices which are not considered fully paid and complete. In other
            words, if you accept a payment before it is credited by us to your Account ledger, we are not required to
            settle to you if we determine that the payment was fraudulent or otherwise invalid. Your Dashboard will
            display the current status for each payment (i.e., “paid”, “confirmed”, “complete”, “overpaid”,
            “underpaid”, “refunded”, or “invalid”). Payments that may be fraudulent will be identified in the
            Dashboard as invalid, which reflects that they have failed to achieve any block confirmations in the
            applicable blockchain. The failure to achieve block confirmations could also occur for reasons other than
            fraud (e.g. the payment was sent with insufficient miner fees).

            BitPay may add new cryptocurrencies to the Services. Additional cryptocurrencies will be added to the
            Services on an opt-out basis, such that they will be enabled by default unless you instruct BitPay to disable
            them. In addition, there may be circumstances that cause BitPay to decide to remove a particular
            cryptocurrency as a payment option.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.4 Payment Exceptions</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            In certain situations when an Invoice is underpaid or overpaid, it will result in a “payment exception”.
            Shoppers will automatically receive a notification via email and/or SMS messaging from BitPay in order to
            claim the underpayment or overpayment, as described below. BitPay incurs miner fees to refund a payment.
            If a Shopper requests a refund for a payment exception, BitPay will deduct the miner fees from the refunded
            amount (see Section 14, Fees, for details).
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.4.1 Underpayments</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Underpayments occur when a Shopper sends insufficient funds to fully pay an Invoice. Underpayments cannot
            fulfill an Invoice in full or part, and the underpayment is not credited to your Account. BitPay will
            notify the Shopper of the underpayment by email and/or SMS message and such notification will enable the
            Shopper to request a refund for the partial payment. The Shopper may also request a refund of the
            underpayment directly from the Invoice. To complete the transaction, the Shopper will need to generate a
            new Invoice by restarting the checkout process. The new Invoice will provide the Shopper with a new
            payment amount based on the then-current exchange rate and a new time window in which to complete the
            payment.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.4.2 Overpayments</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Overpayments occur when a Shopper sends funds in excess of the amount needed to fulfill the Invoice. In
            such cases, the Invoice passes through the state of being paid in full and is marked as an overpayment.
            Once the Invoice status is set to "complete", the funds needed to fully pay the Invoice are applied to
            your Account. However, the excess funds are not applied. BitPay will send a notification by email and/or
            SMS message to the Shopper enabling the Shopper to request a refund for the excess funds. The Shopper also
            has the ability to request a refund of the excess funds directly from the Invoice.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.4.3 Orphan Payments</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            “Orphan payments” occur when a transaction is received outside the time window referenced in Section 10.1,
            Invoice Generation and Competitive Exchange Rate Guarantee. Any payments sent to the expired Invoice will
            show up in BitPay’s system as an orphan payment. Orphan payments also occur when a user sends
            cryptocurrency to one of our wallet addresses without a connection to an Invoice. BitPay cannot
            automatically associate orphan payments with an Invoice, merchant, Shopper email or SMS capable phone
            number. For more information or to resolve orphaned payments, either you or the Shopper will need to reach
            out to our support team
            <a rel="noreferrer noopener" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="https://support.bitpay.com" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>
              (https://support.bitpay.com)
            </a>
            with required information. Orphan payments are failed payments, and cannot be applied to an Invoice. If an
            orphan payment occurs, the Shopper will need to generate a new Invoice and restart the checkout process.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>10.4.4 Unsupported Payments</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Unless explicitly mentioned on our website or in this Agreement, we do not support or process payments for
            unsupported coins, tokens, or blockchain forks, collectively known as “Unsupported Payments” ("UP").
            Shoppers should not pay a BitPay Invoice with UP or send UP to a BitPay address. If a Shopper transmits UP,
            the Shopper may lose any perceived value in the UP. Additionally, BitPay assumes no responsibility
            whatsoever with respect to UP and Shoppers will not be able to recover UP from BitPay. For an overview of

            If a payment exception occurs, BitPay will try to locate you or the Shopper using the information shown in
            our records, but if BitPay is unable to contact you or the Shopper and/or has no record of you or the
            Shopper's use of the Acceptance Services for several years, applicable law may require BitPay to report
            these funds as unclaimed property to the applicable jurisdiction. BitPay reserves the right to deduct a
            dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable law.

            If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, or if
            required by law, court order, or at the request of law enforcement, we may delay settlement or restrict
            access to settlement funds. In the case of a delayed settlement, we will strive to promptly inform you,
            unless prohibited by court order or law enforcement. We will not be liable to you for any damages or harm
            caused as a result of such delayed settlement or restricted access. Unless required to delay settlement by
            law, we are committed to not delay or restrict settlement unnecessarily, and if partial delay or
            restriction is possible, we will only partially delay or restrict. Once the reasons for delayed settlement
            or restricted access to settlement funds can be reasonably proven to have been resolved, BitPay will pay
            the full amount of such funds to you without undue delay.

            BitPay can facilitate cryptocurrency refunds to Shoppers on your behalf. You can decide to issue a partial
            refund or refund the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the refund
            based upon the value in which the relevant goods and/or services were priced (pricing currency) or the
            amount of the applicable cryptocurrency used to pay the Invoice (payment currency). Refunds will be
            remitted in the same cryptocurrency used to pay the Invoice. If you do not have enough funds in your
            Account to cover pending refund requests, we may require you to make a bank deposit to an account
            specified by us. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot
            rate determined by us, following the guidelines found here:

            BitPay is not responsible for merchant refund policies, or for verifying that such policies conform to
            applicable law. We suggest merchants provide a clear refund policy to their customers (including, if
            applicable, “no refunds are allowed as all sales are final”). For certain industries, a refund policy may
            not be applicable (e.g., where a service is provided). For refunds in amounts based upon the fiat pricing
            currency (i.e. the fiat price for the applicable goods/services), BitPay will convert the value of the
            currency in which the item was priced to the applicable cryptocurrency using the exchange rate at the time
            the refund is sent to the Shopper.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>11.3 Refund of Payment Exceptions</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If a payment exception is refunded within 30 days after the Invoice creation date, the exact amount of
            cryptocurrency originally received will be returned to the Shopper, less the applicable miner fee.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If a payment exception is not refunded by the 30th day after the Invoice creation date, BitPay will
            establish a maximum U.S. Dollar or Euro (depending on whether Merchant’s contract is with BitPay, Inc. or
            BitPay B.V.) value for the refund based upon the exchange rate on such 30th day. Thus, when the refund is
            ultimately sent, the amount of the refund will be the lesser of the amount of cryptocurrency originally
            sent to BitPay, or the cryptocurrency equivalent of the maximum U.S. Dollar/Euro value as determined from
            the exchange rate at the time the refund is sent. The applicable miner fee required to send the refund
            will be deducted from the amount of the refund sent to the Shopper.

            cryptocurrencies, or in a mixture of both, and we have no right to impose any cryptocurrency over local
            currency, as your choice in this respect supersedes any of our preferences.

            An Account ledger will be created for each currency selected for settlement pursuant to your settlement

            balances that are received after the date of the change. Any Account ledger balances dating from before
            the preference change will settle pursuant to your pre-change settlement preferences.

            If your settlement preference includes cryptocurrency settlement, any supported cryptocurrency accepted by
            BitPay on your behalf must be settled to a cryptocurrency wallet
            that you provide. Payments in any of the supported cryptocurrencies will be sent to your designated wallet
            address, generally by the end of the day following the relevant transaction (as determined in U.S. Eastern
            Standard or Daylight Time, as applicable) and provided that the settlement minimum is met. We are not
            liable for any losses incurred as a result of improperly reported or designated wallet addresses that you
            provide.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            You assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrencies in which settlement occurs. If any of the supported
            cryptocurrencies are the chosen settlement medium, you assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrency
            value.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Absent a written agreement to the contrary, BitPay’s Acceptance Services do not include cryptocurrency
            custody. If you choose to be settled in cryptocurrency, and if we cannot complete such settlement with you,
            BitPay will freeze the value of any Account ledger balance at the U.S. Dollar or Euro (depending on
            whether your contract is with BitPay, Inc. or BitPay B.V.) conversion rate at the time the settlement
            otherwise would have occurred. For example, if a Shopper makes a purchase from you such that you are to be
            settled 0.1 BTC, but we cannot complete the settlement to a wallet address that you provided, then when
            the settlement to your wallet would otherwise have occurred, we will freeze the value of the settlement in
            U.S. Dollars/Euro at the applicable U.S. Dollar/Euro conversion rate. You may subsequently be settled in
            cryptocurrency or fiat, but that settlement amount will be based on the frozen U.S. Dollar/Euro value,
            regardless of currency value fluctuations in the intervening period. In this example, and using U.S.
            Dollars, if at the time the settlement would otherwise have occurred to your wallet, the value of 0.1 BTC
            was U.S.$5,000, then that will be the value frozen for this transaction on your Account ledger. If you
            ultimately decide to receive fiat settlement of this Account ledger balance, such settlement will be for
            U.S.$5,000, regardless of the prevailing BTC to U.S. Dollar exchange rate at the time of settlement.
            Similarly, if you maintain your bitcoin settlement preference and you provide a valid bitcoin wallet
            address, we will remit settlement at the then prevailing exchange rate based on the U.S.$5,000 value
            (e.g., if the exchange rate when we complete the settlement--after receiving a valid wallet address is 1
            BTC:U.S.$80,000, you will receive 0.0625 BTC, or if the exchange rate is 1 BTC:U.S.$25,000, you will
            receive 0.2 BTC).

            While there are material risks from accepting various forms of payment (such as cash, other fiat
            currencies, network card payments, other proprietary electronic payments and alternative virtual currency
            payments), BitPay discloses the following:
          </p> <ol data-v-0300231e><li data-v-0300231e>
              Virtual Currency (like Bitcoin) is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and
              value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor
              Protection Corporation protections;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may
              adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
              accidental transactions may not be recoverable;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is
              not necessarily the date or time that the Shopper initiates the transaction;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to
              exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total
              loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              There is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do
              so in the future;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may
              result in significant loss over a short period of time;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by BitPay may
              prevent the access or use of a Shopper’s Virtual Currency; and
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Any bond or trust account maintained by BitPay for the benefit of its Merchants may not be sufficient to
              cover all losses incurred by customers.

            Upon your direction, we can set a refund reserve on your Account. The purpose of the refund reserve
            is to make sure there is always a buffer of funds available on your Account to cover pending refunds
            (e.g., when goods/services are not delivered).
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If no refund reserve is set, pending refunds will be deducted from the balance on your Account, which is
            settled daily by us. If a refund reserve is set, we will only settle the pending balance sitting on top of
            the refund reserve amount. If there is no balance to be settled, we will use the funds available in your
            refund reserve to cover pending refund requests from your Account. If the refund reserve is being used,
            any incoming deposits to your Account would first refill the reserve up to the amount defined (incoming
            deposits are Invoices paid by Shoppers and/or bank deposits from you to an account specified by BitPay).
            Refund reserve values are established and maintained in fiat currency only.

            BitPay settles the accumulated balance on your Account ledger if it is above the minimum amount defined
            for the settlement currency selected on the Dashboard. Please refer to

          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            For cryptocurrency Account ledger balances below the settlement minimum, BitPay will freeze the
            transaction values in your Account at the U.S. Dollar or Euro (depending on whether your contract is with
            BitPay, Inc. or BitPay B.V.) equivalent value at the conversion rate at the time
            the settlement would otherwise have occurred (i.e., at the time the balance would have been settled but
            for the settlement minimum not being met). Once the cumulative Account ledger balance for a given
            cryptocurrency reaches the settlement minimum, as measured by the conversion rate at the applicable
            settlement time, BitPay will remit the cryptocurrency settlement to your applicable wallet address.

            Cryptocurrency transactions typically incur miner fees. These fees are automatically created by
            cryptocurrency wallets in order to broadcast a transaction on a given blockchain network. These fees are
            paid to cryptocurrency miners (and their operators) that process transactions and maintain the respective
            network.
            <span class="legal-terms__break" data-v-0300231e></span>
            Miner fees are variable depending on network conditions and the desired confirmation speed for the
            transaction. If a cryptocurrency network gets congested, the minimum required miner fee will be higher to
            ensure the transaction can be reliably processed on the network. Using a lower-than-average miner fee can
            put a transaction at risk of slow confirmation or no confirmation at all.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong class="legal-terms__italic" data-v-0300231e>BitPay Network Costs</strong> <br data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay network costs are additional fees incurred by BitPay in aggregating received payments and settling
            such payments to merchants. Network costs are based upon the miner fees that BitPay incurs in providing
            its Services. Therefore, if miner fees rise, network costs also rise.

            We will provide not less than thirty (30) days’ advance notice of such a change, and your continued use of

            deduct the miner fee used to send such a refund from the amount of cryptocurrency that is refunded to the

            this miner fee deduction will appear as a separate entry in your Account ledger after the refund is

            involves the Acceptance Services or the Terms and cannot be resolved between the parties with reasonable
            effort, the disagreement or dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration
            administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. or

            without regard to their conflict of laws rules. If you are acting as a consumer, and your contract is with

            Claims brought by a Consumer: To the extent that Your claim meets the applicable jurisdictional
            requirements, You may choose to pursue Your claim in small claims court so long as the claim remains a
            small claim and is addressed on an individual basis. Except for small claims, any dispute arising in
            connection with these Terms, use of the Services or our relationship, regardless of type or nature,
            whether brought by You or BitPay, shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration, on an individual
            basis, pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s rules of arbitration for consumer-related
            disputes (accessible here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" role="button" tabindex="0" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>

          </a>). At Your request, arbitration may be conducted in person, by telephone or video conference, and may be
            decided on written briefs, without oral hearings. If the arbitration is held in person, the proceedings
            will be conducted in Your city or county of residence, or in a mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator
            may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be
            enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or
            collateral estoppel effect. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or
            proceeding to enforce these Terms, any arbitration pursuant to these Terms, or any small claims action
            shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would
            impose filing fees or other administrative costs on You, We will reimburse You, upon request, to the
            extent such fees or costs would exceed those that You would otherwise have to pay if You were proceeding
            instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration
            administrator's rules or applicable law.

            administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules,
            and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
            thereof. The arbitration shall occur in Atlanta, Georgia. The parties shall evenly divide the costs of the
            arbitrator and the proceeding, but shall otherwise each be responsible for their own attorney, expert and
            other costs and expenses.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            All claims: Any arbitration shall be heard before a single arbitrator, and shall be conducted exclusively
            in the English language. Any disputes as to the interpretation, application or scope of this arbitration
            provision shall be determined solely by the arbitrator, and not by a court or judge.

            CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL

            ARBITRATION. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION, HAVE A
            TRIAL BEFORE A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT(EXCEPT AS TO SMALL CLAIMS) OR TO HAVE ANY TRIAL BY JURY.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If the foregoing Class Action Waiver becomes unenforceable, then this arbitration provision shall be

            For security, fraud and anti-money laundering prevention, regulatory, legal and compliance reasons,
            BitPay is obligated to gather certain information on individuals, businesses and organizations making
            payments (“Shoppers”) and/or individuals, businesses and organizations receiving payments (“Recipients”)
            using BitPay’s services. We fulfill these obligations by requiring Shoppers and Recipients to provide
            certain information so that we can confirm the submitter’s identity, and verify that the submitter is not
            subject to sanctions or other legal restrictions. By completing these verifications using the Services,
            the Shopper and/or Recipient creates a “BitPay ID”, which is a virtual credential that we maintain in our

            ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE
            PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS
            SECTION AND THE PRIOR SECTION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
            REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT.

            interpretation, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its

            Claims brought by a Consumer: To the extent that your claim meets the applicable jurisdictional
            requirements, you may choose to pursue your claim in small claims court so long as the claim remains a
            small claim and is addressed on an individual basis. Except for small claims, any dispute arising in
            connection with these BitPay ID Terms, use of the Services or our relationship, regardless of type or
            nature, whether brought by you or BitPay, shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration, on an
            individual basis, pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s rules of arbitration for
            consumer-related disputes (accessible here: <a aria-label="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" role="button" tabindex="0" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>
            www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf
          </a>). At your request, arbitration may be conducted in person, by telephone or video conference, and may be
            decided on written briefs, without oral hearings. If the arbitration is held in person, the proceedings
            will be conducted in your city or county of residence, or in a mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator
            may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be
            enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or
            collateral estoppel effect. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or
            proceeding to enforce these BitPay ID Terms, any arbitration pursuant to these BitPay ID Terms, or any
            small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration
            administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon
            request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you
            were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the
            arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.

            Claims brought by a Business: Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these BitPay ID Terms,
            or the breach thereof, regardless of the type of claim, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the
            American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the
            award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration
            shall occur in Atlanta, Georgia. The parties shall evenly divide the costs of the arbitrator and the
            proceeding, but shall otherwise each be responsible for their own attorney, expert and other costs and
            expenses.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            All claims: Any arbitration shall be heard before a single arbitrator, and shall be conducted exclusively
            in the English language. Any disputes as to the interpretation, application or scope of this arbitration
            provision shall be determined solely by the arbitrator, and not by a court or judge.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL
            CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU AGREE THAT THERE MAY BE NO CLASS
            ARBITRATION. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION, HAVE A
            TRIAL BEFORE A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT (EXCEPT AS TO CONSUMERS BRINGING SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS) OR TO HAVE
            ANY TRIAL BY JURY.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If the foregoing Class Action Waiver becomes unenforceable, then this arbitration provision shall be
            struck in its entirety, and any claims shall be subject solely to the jurisdiction and venue of the state
            and federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia, USA. The parties consent to such jurisdiction and
            venue, and waive any defense or objection thereto, including any claim of inconvenient forum.

            Claims brought by a Business: If your relationship is with BitPay B.V. and a disagreement or dispute
            arises that in any way involves the Acceptance Services or the Terms and cannot be resolved between the
            parties with reasonable effort, the disagreement or dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final and
            binding arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance with its
            Rules of Arbitration. The seat of such arbitration shall be Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The arbitration
            will be conducted before a single arbitrator in the English language. Proceedings shall occur virtually
            or, if in person, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, or such other location as may be agreed upon by the
            parties. The parties shall evenly divide the costs of the arbitrator and the proceeding, but shall

            Any court proceedings in The Netherlands before, during or after the arbitration will - to the extent

            Appeal, whichever has jurisdiction, following proceedings in English before the Chambers for International
            Commercial Matters (Netherlands Commercial Court, which consists of the NCC District Court, the NCC Court
            in Summary Proceedings and the NCC Court of Appeal). The NCC Rules of Procedure (see www.ncc.gov.nl) apply

            Prior to receiving a Payout, to comply with BitPay’s compliance requirements, your Recipient must verify
            his or her identity by signing up for BitPay’s identity verification account, called “BitPay ID,” or
            signing in with an existing BitPay ID. During this process, the Recipient must provide a valid
            cryptocurrency address which will enable receipt of Payouts.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay will confirm that the Recipient’s provided cryptocurrency address is valid, and does not appear on
            applicable sanctions lists, and is otherwise acceptable from a risk exposure perspective. However, BitPay
            cannot confirm that the address truly belongs to the Recipient,
            nor that the Recipient possesses private keys to the associated wallet. BitPay is not responsible for any
            errors related to any provided address.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            To have a cryptocurrency address, Recipients need a cryptocurrency wallet. Recipients are free to choose
            any cryptocurrency wallet, including the BitPay wallet. Use of the BitPay wallet is solely subject to
            BitPay’s Wallet Terms of Use, which are between BitPay and the wallet holder.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Regardless of the cryptocurrency wallet used, including the BitPay wallet, BitPay has no control over or
            access to the private keys for such wallet, and therefore no control over or access to the Recipient’s
            funds. BitPay does not assume any risk or liability for a Recipient’s use of any wallet.
          </p> <p class="legal-terms__italic" data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay is not responsible for, and cannot assist with recovery of, any loss of cryptocurrency funds
            incurred if a wallet is compromised, for example due to loss of or unauthorized access to private keys,
            accidental sharing of a backup, a bug in the user’s device or the wallet software, or a malicious attack
            on the wallet software. In the event a Payout is made to a wallet that becomes compromised or inaccessible,
            it is up to you to decide how to handle any inquiries or claims. BitPay does not get involved in resolving
            such issues.

            Currently, BitPay supports Payouts only in certain cryptocurrencies. BitPay may enable
            additional cryptocurrencies in the future. Your recipients will select the cryptocurrency in
            which they wish to receive their Payout.

            Payouts are only processed if you have sufficient funds available in your Account balance at the time the
            Payouts are sent. As part of your onboarding process, we will provide you with instructions for funding
            and maintaining your Account. Payouts are sent pursuant to the schedule listed in BitPay’s FAQs: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052494652-Getting-started-with-BitPay-Send-for-merchants-" role="button" tabindex="0" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>

            noted in this FAQ.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            BitPay locks the cryptocurrency exchange rate at the time the Payout request is executed. You agree that
            you assume the volatility risk of the fiat currency in which you hold a balance in your Account. For
            example, if you instruct us to send $150.00 worth of Bitcoin to a Recipient, BitPay will lock the exchange
            rate, send the Bitcoin equivalent to the Recipient, and debit $150.00 (plus the Payout processing fee, as
            set forth in Section 12) from your Account balance, but we do not guarantee the value of the U.S. Dollar
            or any other applicable fiat currency relative to any benchmark.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            The payment of cryptocurrency by BitPay to a Recipient is evidenced via public information in the
            blockchain and via confirmation reporting made available to you in BitPay’s API.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If for some reason a Payout cannot be completed pursuant to your instructions, BitPay will retain the
            associated funds, which we will either return to you or retain in your Account to use to fund the Payout
            upon receiving updated instructions from you.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e><strong data-v-0300231e>5.4  Competitive Exchange Rate Calculation for Payout Recipients</strong></p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            When BitPay executes Payout requests, we use BitPay’s Best Ask (“BBA”) rate. All Payouts in a set of
            instructions use the same exchange rate. For more information about how BitPay calculates exchange rates
            and factors in market depth, please refer to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://bitpay.com/exchange-rates" role="button" tabindex="0" class="legal-terms__link" data-v-0300231e>

            We will process Payouts according to your instructions. You are responsible for the content and accuracy
            of the Payout request. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to
            BitPay, as the transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.

            or promotions by third parties. If you decide to use any of these third-party services, you do so at your

            We have implemented security measures designed to protect information from accidental loss and from
            unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Our security measures include risk assessments and
            controls for the following:  application and system access, system and application development and
            maintenance, acceptable use, data classification, incident response, disaster recovery and business
            continuity, and security training.  We cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never gain access
            to your information, and you acknowledge that you provide your information at your own risk, except as
            otherwise provided by applicable law. If we reasonably suspect or we become aware of a breach of our
            security measures that may have impacted you, your Account or your information, we will provide you with
            notice within 72 hours of gaining such suspicion or becoming aware of such breach. Such notice will be

            While there are material risks from various forms of payment (such as cash, other fiat currencies, network
            card payments, other proprietary electronic payments and alternative virtual currency payments), BitPay
            discloses the following:
          </p> <ol data-v-0300231e><li data-v-0300231e>
              Virtual Currency (like Bitcoin) is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and
              value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor
              Protection Corporation protections;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may
              adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
              accidental transactions may not be recoverable;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is
              not necessarily the date or time that the Payout is sent;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to
              exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total
              loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              There is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do
              so in the future;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may
              result in significant loss over a short period of time;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              The nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by BitPay may
              prevent Payouts made in Virtual Currency; and
            </li> <li data-v-0300231e>
              Any bond or trust account maintained by BitPay for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to
              cover all losses incurred by customers.
            </li></ol> <h4 class="text__heading-3--small" data-v-0300231e>12. Fees</h4> <p data-v-0300231e>
            We charge a processing fee for each Payout successfully processed through your Account. You may choose to
            bear the processing fee, in which case the processing fee is payable in addition to the Payout amount. For
            example, if you are making a payout with the equivalent of $150.00 in Bitcoin, and assuming a 1%
            processing fee, $151.50 will be debited from your Account, and your Recipient will receive Bitcoin worth
            $150.00 (based on the conversion rate at the time BitPay processes the Payout), less the applicable miner
            fee. BitPay will retain $1.50 as its processing fee. Alternatively, you may choose to pass the processing
            fee on to your recipient. In this scenario, if you are making a payout with the equivalent of $150.00 in
            Bitcoin, and assuming a 1% processing fee, $150.00 will be debited from your Account, and your Recipient
            will receive Bitcoin worth $148.50 (based on the conversion rate at the time BitPay processes the Payout),
            less the applicable miner fee. BitPay will retain $1.50 as its processing fee.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Miner fees are the fees required to broadcast cryptocurrency transactions to the relevant blockchain so
            that the miners will process the transactions and maintain the blockchain. Miner fees are incurred on
            every on-chain cryptocurrency transaction, including Payouts. BitPay does not retain any portion of the
            miner fees. Miner fees are variable depending on factors such as network conditions on the applicable
            blockchain. You may choose to bear the miner fees or have the miner fee deducted from the Payout sent to
            your Recipient. Either way, miner fees are deducted after the BitPay processing fee.
          </p> <h4 class="text__heading-3--small" data-v-0300231e>13. Indemnification</h4> <p data-v-0300231e>
            You agree to indemnify BitPay, its affiliates, and any of its and their officers, directors, employees and
            agents from and against any claims, costs, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and judgments of any and

            or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises or relates to any actual or alleged
            breach of your representations, warranties, or obligations set forth in the BitPay Send Terms.

            DAMAGES, BITPAY B.V. DOES NOT OTHERWISE EXCLUDE ITS LIABILITY FOR ITS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL

          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>

            EARNED BY US IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE 6 MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING
            THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR LIABILITY.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO
            THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

            Under Dutch law you have a statutory legal responsibility to verify correct performance by us and to
            complain about any defects in the performance of our obligations. You hereby agree to verify correct
            performance by us and to complain about any defects in the performance of our obligations to us in writing
            within six (6) months after you have received our Services. Defects that are not reported to us within this
            complaints period of six (6) months will be qualified as lapsed and can no longer be invoked against us.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Any claim against us, including but not limited to claims for damages, claims based on undue payment or
            claims regarding the performance of our obligations to you, is subject to a limitation period of twelve
            (12) months.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            If your contractual relationship is with BitPay B.V. and a disagreement or dispute arises that in any way
            involves the Acceptance Services or the Terms and cannot be resolved between the parties with reasonable
            effort, the disagreement or dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration
            administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance with its Rules of Arbitration.
            The seat of such arbitration shall be Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The arbitration will be conducted before
            a single arbitrator in the English language. Proceedings shall occur virtually or, if in person, in
            Amsterdam, The Netherlands, or such other location as may be agreed upon by the parties. The parties shall
            evenly divide the costs of the arbitrator and the proceeding, but shall otherwise each be responsible for
            their own attorney, expert and other costs and expenses.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Any court proceedings in The Netherlands before, during or after the arbitration will - to the extent
            allowed by law - exclusively be dealt with by the Amsterdam District Court or the Amsterdam Court of
            Appeal, whichever has jurisdiction, following proceedings in English before the Chambers for International
            Commercial Matters (Netherlands Commercial Court, which consists of the NCC District Court, the NCC Court
            in Summary Proceedings and the NCC Court of Appeal). The NCC Rules of Procedure (see www.ncc.gov.nl) apply
            to these proceedings. This clause is not intended to exclude Supreme Court appeal.

            A Party’s “Confidential Information” is defined as any information of the disclosing party, which: (a) if
            disclosed in a tangible form is marked as “Confidential” or “Proprietary” or if not so marked, should be
            reasonably understood by the receiving party from the context of disclosure or from the information
            itself, to be confidential; (b) if disclosed orally or visually is declared to be confidential or, if not
            so declared, should be reasonably understood by the receiving party from the context of disclosure or from
            the information itself to be confidential; or (c) is designated as Confidential Information in these BitPay
            Send Terms. Confidential Information shall include without limitation, information accessed via the BitPay
            API, technical specifications and processes of each Party, and all Business Customer data.  Each Party
            shall hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose such
            Confidential Information to third parties nor use the other party’s Confidential Information for any
            purpose other than solely as required and necessary to perform its obligations under these BitPay Send
            Terms. Such restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information that: (a) is known by the recipient
            prior to the date of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) becomes publicly known through no act or
            fault of the recipient; (c) is received by recipient from a third party without a restriction on disclosure
            or use; or (d) is independently developed by recipient without reference to or knowledge of the
            Confidential Information.
          </p> <p data-v-0300231e>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may share Confidential Information with an affiliate in the event
            that the other Party requests services from such affiliate and such affiliate shall be bound by this
            Section. In the event Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by a court, government agency,
            regulatory requirement, or similar disclosure requirement, the Party subject to such requirement shall
            promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of the existence or likely existence of such
            requirement and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and, if necessary, use reasonable
            efforts to obtain confidential treatment or protection by order of any disclosed Confidential Information.
            The Parties’ respective obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information disclosed hereunder
            shall survive the expiration or termination of the BitPay Send Terms or until such time as such
            information becomes public information through no fault of the receiving party.
