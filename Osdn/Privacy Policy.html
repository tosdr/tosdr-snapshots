</p><p>We are committed to good privacy practices regarding personal data, and we aim to give the users of our Sites as much rights as possible to control their own personal information including registration information. Under strict control, we safely accumulate and store personal information that we collect or submitted to us, and take appropriate preventive and corrective actions against improper access
to, loss, destruction, falsification, and leaking of personal information.
</p><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all activities or behaviors of our users during the registering and using of the Sites owned by OSDN. 
Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our <a href="https://osdn.net/tos.php">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, we do not release personal data about our users and visitors without their permission. 
By proceeding to use the OSDN Services, you consent that we may process the personal data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In certain areas of the Sites, we may request a user to provide us with certain personal information.
For example, it applies to information such as username, social media services, email address, and self introduction provided in order to complete the profile on the registered account.
However, for most of the information, beside username, it is left to the user's discretion to register.
</p><p>We may request the users to provide us with personal information when they post contents (such as source code, release files, articles, journal, photos, comments, or reviews), create a new account, subscribe to any of our mailing lists, or participate in certain services.
That could include personal information such as phone number, name, zip code, age, or profession.

</p><p><strong>Aggregated data:</strong><br />
We may aggregate the data we collect from our users (including IP addresses, operating system, and browser software types).
In the course of aggregating the data, we anonymize and de-identify it so each piece of data cannot be associated with the user.
We may disclose Aggregated Data to advertisers to inform them the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.
</p><h2 id="h2-2..20How.20we.20use.20the.20information.20we.20gather">2.

We are not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personal data that a user chooses to submit to public pages.

</li></ul><h2 id="h2-4..20Cookies.2C.20web.20beacons.20and.20similar.20tracking.20Technologies">4. Cookies, web beacons and similar tracking Technologies</h2><p>On OSDN Sites, there are pages that use technology called &quot;web beacons&quot;.
It is a technology also known as clear GIF, in which small graphic files are used to track the accesses to certain pages.
With this technology, it is possible to track a specific individual, but on our Sites, we do not use it for such purpose to obtain personal data, except that we may use it as a part of the mechanism to make sure that the downloading of contents occurs at a server that is geographically close to the user.
</p><p>Certain browsers have a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; feature that allows you to tell websites or applications that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Please note that at this time our Sites generally do not respond to browser &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals.
</p><p>We also use cookies on our Sites to provide our users with information that meets their needs. 
Cookie is a data file that is sent  to the browser from a site that a user visited, which could be stored in the user's environment by the browser. 
It is user's responsibility to turn off cookies or delete existing cookies from the user’s environment.
Please note that by opting out of cookies, you may encounter a situation where a part of or the entire OSDN Site may not function properly.
</p><p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising:</strong><br />
We may also participate in advertising networks that use interest-based advertising methods relying on cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies. 
This means that a user may see advertising on our Sites tailored to the user’s browsing behavior, or the user may see our advertising on other websites based on their behavior on our Sites.
</p><p>Some internet browsers, websites, and mobile devices offer opt-outs for interest-based advertising.
