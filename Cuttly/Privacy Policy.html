<h1 class="h1_of">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Updated: March 21, 2024</small></p>
<h2 class="h2_of_a">1) GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1. This Privacy Policy is for information only, which does not mean that no obligation arises for the Website’s Users hereunder. It lays down, above all, the rules whereby personal data is processed by the Website’s Administrator, including the framework, objectives, and scope of personal data processing and the rights of data subjects, as well as provides information on cookies and analytical tools used on the Website.

Śląska 15A/9, 80-384 Gdańsk, taxpayer identification number: NIP PL7431817809, business identification number: REGON 220981298, e-mail address: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ef8c80819b8e8c9baf8c9a9b9bc18396">[email&#160;protected]</a>, hereinafter referred to as the Administrator, who is also the Website Provider.
</li>
<li id="GDPR">
3.

</li>
<li>
4. Using the Website is voluntary. The provision of personal data by the Website user is also voluntary, save for two exceptions: (1) Contracting with the Administrator: failure to provide the personal details required for the signing and performance of the Electronic Services Contract with the Administrator in the cases and to the extent specified on the Website and in the Website Regulations and this Privacy Policy makes it impossible to sign such a contract. In such an event, submission of personal data is a contractual requirement, and if the data subject to is willing to sign a contract with the Administrator, the Administrator is obligated to provide all the required details. In each case, the scope of the data required for the signing of a contract is specified beforehand on the Website and in the Website Regulations; (2) Administrator’s statutory obligations: submission of personal data is statutorily required under generally applicable regulations whereby the Administrator is obligated to process personal data (e.g. as part of its tax or accounting obligations) and failure to submit the same makes it impossible for them to meet such obligations.
</li>
<li>
5.

</li>
<li>
6. Considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of data processing and the risk, however likely and imminent, of violating any right or freedom of natural persons, the Administrator implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to make data processing compliant with this regulation and be able to prove it. If needed, such measures are reviewed and updated. The Administrator takes technical measures to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or altering any personal data that is transmitted electronically.
</li>
<li>
7. All words, expressions, and acronyms used throughout this Privacy Policy and starting with a capital letter (e.g. User, Online Store, Electronic Service) should be deemed as defined in the Website Regulations available on the Website.
</li>
</ul>

The Administrator is entitled to process personal data if and insofar as at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (1) the data subject to has consented to his or her personal data being processed for one or more purposes; (2) data processing is necessary to perform the contract which the data subject to is party to or to take any measures at the request of the data subject to prior to signing the contract; (3) data processing is necessary to comply with the legal obligation imposed on the Administrator; or (4) data processing is necessary for the purposes determined by the legitimate interests pursued by the Administrator or any third party, save where such interests are overshadowed by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the eligible data subject, especially if such a person is a child.
</li>
<li>
2. Processing of personal data by the Administrator is, in each case, contingent on the existence of at least one of the prerequisites indicated in 2.1 hereof.

</li>
<li>
5. <b>Right to object direct marketing</b> – if personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, the data subject is entitled to raise at any time an objection against his or her personal data being processed for the purpose of such marketing, including data profiling, insofar as the data processing is associated with such direct marketing.
