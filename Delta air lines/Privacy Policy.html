<div class="container globalanchorchk textdescription"><p>We only base our use of personal data on our legitimate interests when we consider that our legitimate interest is not overridden by the individual's interests or rights in the data.</p>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “consent” means any statement or clear affirmative action by which you agree to the processing of personal data for a specific purpose. Please note that where you have provided your consent to us for processing your information, you can withdraw this at any time as described in <b>section 8</b>.</p>
<h4>4.2.<b> Information collected through our App</b></h4>
<p>Delta may collect and receive personal information from the App users through the Software Development Tools (SDKs) deployed on the Fly Delta App. Depending on the SDK, the type of personal information collected and received via the SDKs may include, without limitation, the App user’s name, email address, phone number, mailing address, SkyMiles number, credit card information (to the extent a credit card transaction is being made through the App), customer flight information, App usage metrics, and device information such as IP address. Delta may use such information to verify and authorize credit card transactions, to receive feedback about the App and services, and to track and analyze usage of the App. </p>
<p>Please find below the current list of the Software Development Tools (SDKs) deployed on the Fly Delta App. Delta may update this list of SDKs from time to time if services provided by Delta change.</p>
<p>List of the SDKs deployed on the Fly Delta App as of April 1, 2022: </p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Marketing Cloud + branch.io plugin </li>
<li>Cardinal Commerce</li>
<li>ForeSee</li>
<li>American Express</li>
</ul>
<p>We use push notification tokens in the App to send notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes, and flight cancellations. The App will activate your camera if you choose to take a picture for a parking reminder, and will store the photo for you to look at later. If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule. It can also bring up your default e-mail program, so you can send notes and reminders while traveling.</p>
<p>At times, we may promote the App via internet advertising on external websites. If you click on these advertisements and navigate directly to a third party application or other platform, information such as your phone’s device identification number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising. This information might also be used for capping the number of times a specific visitor to a website is shown a particular advertisement, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection.</p>
<h4>4.3.<b> Legal requirements and professional advice</b></h4>
<p>We may also use your personal information where this is necessary to comply with a reasonable request by a law enforcement or regulatory authority, body, or agency, or in the defense of legal claims.<br />
<br />
We may also use your personal information when obtaining legal and other professional advice including for audits. We consider this to be in our legitimate interest in the management of our business.</p>
<h4>4.4.<b> What if you do not provide information?</b></h4>
<p>In some cases, we are legally required to collect certain information from you so we can provide the services you have requested, such as Secure Flight Passenger Data or Advance Passenger Information when you make a reservation to fly within, into, or out of the United States, or for point-to-point international travel. Failure to provide this information will mean we cannot provide the service.<br />
<br />
In some circumstances we need your information to perform our contract with you or to provide products and services, such as payment details and, on occasion, credit checking information. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or provide the products and services.</p>
<h4>4.5. <b>Authorization on behalf of another customer</b></h4>
<p>When you provide information to us about your travel companions or other individuals (if, for example, you have arranged to make a booking on their behalf), you confirm to us that you have obtained their authorization to provide us their information and their consent to your use of their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you cannot make these confirmations, you must not provide us with any personal information about these individuals.</p>
<h4>4.6. <b>Sensitive Information</b></h4>
<p>We may process sensitive or special categories of personal information, such as that relating to health, disabilities, race, ethnicity, political opinions, biometrics, or religion, for the purpose(s) for which it was provided or for which you have provided express consent. For example, we may collect and receive sensitive personal information from you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide such information to us, a travel agent, or another third party involved in your travel arrangements at the time of or following your booking;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>disclose to us that you have a specific medical condition, will have an accompanying service animal, or request specific medical care or assistance, such as the provision of an accompanying nurse or wheelchair assistance, from us, an airport, or a third party involved in your travel arrangements;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>make a request that implies or suggests something about you which could be interpreted as sensitive personal information, such as a request for a specific type of meal that may suggest that you have a certain medical condition or hold a particular religious belief;<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>consent to the collection of your digital image to enable our supplier's facial recognition system for lounge access purposes; or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>provide information required by public health authorities or other government agencies as contemplated by 4.1.j.</li>
</ul>
<p>We occasionally receive personal information from law enforcement agencies and other sources relating to criminal activity (or alleged criminal activity) and may use that information where necessary, and where permitted by applicable law, to detect or prevent unlawful activity occurring during air travel. We consider this to be in the substantial public interest.</p>

If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.</p>
<p>When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. This ID might be generated by or shared with third parties providing us with analytics services, such as Adobe.</p>
<p>If you have questions about third parties with whom Delta may disclose information, please email Privacy@delta.com</p>
<h4>7.2. <strong>Social Media and Messaging Platforms</strong></h4>
<p>You may wish to share information regarding your travel or other activities with Delta on social media and messaging platforms provided by third parties. To utilize social media and message sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those third-party platforms, as you choose. For example, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions. If you choose to contact or interact with us on a third-party social media or messaging platform, you understand that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy applicable to the third-party platform, and that Delta is not responsible for how third-party social media and messaging platforms use, share, or protect your information. The activity on third-party social media and messaging platforms, and the data processed, stored, and provided on them, including data regarding interactions with Delta, is governed by the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy of those third-party platforms.<br />
<br />
7.3. <strong>Disclosure of personal information to customers traveling under the same booking</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When you make a booking, you will be provided with a booking reference such as a confirmation number or record locator number. Your booking reference should be kept confidential at all times. Disclosing your booking reference to other customers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others under the same booking and would not like your individual booking details to be disclosed to them, you may prefer to have each person make and pay for separate bookings.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">7.4. </span><strong>Optional biometrics services </strong></h4>
<p>Delta offers eligible customers, including eligible customers flying on Aeromexico, Air France-KLM, or Virgin Atlantic, the ability to improve their airport experience using optional biometrics services, including facial comparison technology, at participating airports.</p>
<p>You may choose to use facial comparison technology for identity verification, including at flight check-in, bag drop, and boarding gates. If you choose to use facial comparison technology, your image is taken when you would otherwise present another form of identification. The image is encrypted and sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of verifying your identity. If CBP determines that the image matches images associated with your passport or images in CBP's database, CBP transmits a unique identifier back to Delta through an encrypted channel. Delta may associate the unique identifier with other information about you, such as your name and flight number, for the purpose of providing the relevant service. Delta does not receive any biometric information.  <br />
</p>
<p>For more information about CBP’s facial comparison technology, see the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhscbppia-056-traveler-verification-service" target="_target" class="rte-external-link">CBP Traveler Verification Service Privacy Impact Assessment</a>. Please note that if you choose to use facial comparison technology at TSA check points or during CBP processing, TSA and CBP control the processing of your personal information, and this Privacy Policy does not apply.<br />
</p>
<p>7.5. <strong>Contact Tracing</strong></p>
<p>To promote healthy travel and prevent the spread of COVID-19, all Delta customers entering the United States, including U.S. passport holders, are encouraged to provide contact tracing information. Participation in contact tracing is voluntary unless specified by a specific flight, country, city or region.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) supports domestic COVID-19 control efforts by making contact information for customers traveling internationally available to state and local health departments to contact you and provide follow-up instructions for testing and/or potential quarantine.  Delta shares this information with the CDC via CBP utilizing established channels for the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS).   For more information, go to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_target" class="rte-external-link">www.CDC.gov</a> or <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/" target="_target" class="rte-external-link">www.CBP.gov</a>, or see <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/advanced-passenger-information-system-apis-update-national-counterterrorism-center-nctc" target="_target" class="rte-external-link">CBP’s Privacy Impact Assessment for the Advance Passenger Information System</a> for details about how CBP uses APIS information.</p>
<p>7.6.   <strong>Unaccompanied Minors</strong></p>
<p>When children travel alone on our flights, we take every step to make sure the child is safe.  Delta may disclose information pertaining to an unaccompanied minor’s itinerary, for example, in ensuring the safety and security of the child traveling on Delta flights, complying with applicable law and regulations, and coordinating transportation and other services with the child’s parents or guardian.</p>

    <div class="text parbase">

<div class="container globalanchorchk textdescription"><p>This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union, UK and other countries which grant the rights described here. These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.</p>
<h4>9.1. <b>Requesting a copy of your information</b></h4>
<p>To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.</p>
<p>You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.</p>
<h4>9.2. <b>Right to rectification of personal data</b></h4>
<p>If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.</p>
<h4>9.3. <b>Right to restrict processing of personal data</b></h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing</li>
</ul>
<h4>9.4. <b>Right to request deletion of personal data (&quot;right to be forgotten&quot;)</b></h4>
<p>You may request the erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may request erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li> You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>The personal information is excessive for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.<br />
<br />
If you exercise your right to erasure or anonymization, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.</p>
<h4>9.5. <b>Right to object to processing of personal data</b></h4>
<p>You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.<br />
<br />
You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<h4>9.6. <b>Right to data portability</b></h4>
<p>This right applies where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We process the personal information by automated means.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.</p>
<h4>9.7. <b>Complaints to regulator</b></h4>
<p>You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), for example, in the UK or the European Union country where you live or work or where you believe we have infringed your privacy rights.</p>
<p><b>9.8. Rights Applicable Only in Brazil</b></p>
<p><b>9.8.1. Right to request information concerning data transfer</b></p>
<p>You have the right to request information identifying the public and private entities with which your personal information has been shared.  </p>
<p><b>9.8.2. Information on Right to Deny Consent</b></p>
<p>You have the right to request information concerning the consequences of not giving your consent. <br />
<br />
<b>9.9. Exercising these rights</b></p>
<p>We may charge you a small administration fee to respond to your request as allowed by applicable law. In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law, UK law, the Brazilian General Data Protection law, and other applicable laws. (We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.) </p>
<p>Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This time may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example, where requests are complex or numerous.<br />
</p>
<p>Where we do not carry out your request, we will tell you without delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, and we will explain our reasons for not taking the action requested.<br />
</p>
<p>Any request you make must be in writing and include your name and address and any other information that may identify you, such as where your request relates to a travel booking, please provide your booking reference (e.g., confirmation number or record locator number), SkyMiles Account number if you have one, the dates on which the travel took place, and any other relevant information that will assist us to identify your booking. You must also provide a photocopy of your passport or driver’s license so we can verify your identity. Please send your written requests to:</p>

<div class="container globalanchorchk textdescription"><p><b>4. What if You Do Not Provide Information?</b><br />
</p>
<p>In some cases, we are legally required to collect certain information from you so we can provide the services you have requested, such as Secure Flight Passenger Data or Advance Passenger Information when you make a reservation to fly within, into, or out of the United States, or for point-to-point international travel. Failure to provide this information will mean we cannot provide the service.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we need your information to perform our contract with you or to provide products and services, such as payment details. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or provide the products and services.</p>
<p>Any processing of personal data that we perform is in accordance with the provisions of the current data protection legislation of Peru, and this data may only be used for limited purposes such as those mentioned in this section.</p>
<p><b>5. Sensitive Information</b></p>
<p>We may collect or receive sensitive or special categories of personal information, such as that relating to health, disabilities, race, ethnicity, political opinions, biometrics, or religion, where permitted by applicable law. For example, we may collect and receive sensitive personal information from you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide such information to us, a travel agent, or another third party involved in your travel arrangements at the time of or following your booking;</li>
<li>disclose to us that you have a specific medical condition, will have an accompanying service animal, or request specific medical care or assistance, such as the provision of an accompanying nurse or wheelchair assistance, from us, an airport, or a third party involved in your travel arrangements; or</li>
<li>make a request that implies or suggests something about you which could be interpreted as sensitive personal information, such as a request for a specific type of meal that may suggest that you have a certain medical condition or hold a particular religious belief.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will collect, store, use, and transfer your sensitive personal information for the purposes for which it was provided and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy if you provide your express consent at the time of collection</p>
<p><b>6. Data Retention</b></p>
<p>We store your information for as long as legally required and for so long as necessary to support business purposes described in the generally applicable section 3 of this Privacy Policy and consistent with our record retention policies.</p>
<p><b>7. With Whom Does Delta Share Your Information?</b></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information we collect or receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>to third parties to process your information on our behalf, or to assist us in providing our services and/or products, such as our customer care center operators and providers of technical services such as data centers and online tools; however, Delta requires that third parties comply with Delta’s Privacy Policy when processing your information;</li>
<li>to the party providing the service or product when you request or purchase services or products through Delta that are to be provided by another party (for example, Iron Mountain Peru S.A., CORPAC S.A., catering, VIP lounges, such as SUMAQ and HANAQ), hotels, transport companies, accounted outsourcing, Lima Airport Partners S.R.L., Talma Servicios Aeroportuarios S.A., and security companies);</li>
<li>to other Delta Group Companies, including Delta Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation with registration number 2387598 domiciled in the United States of America, for the purposes described in and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Information regarding the Delta Group Companies is available in the generally applicable section 7.1 of this Privacy Policy and Delta’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commissions, including SEC Form 10-K.</li>
<li>to government agencies and authorities, law enforcement officials, law courts, or to third parties: (a) if we believe disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (such as pursuant to a subpoena or judicial order); or (b) to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or safety of third parties, including to establish, make, or defend against legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>8. Your Rights</b></p>
<p>This section applies only to the personal information of individuals in Peru which grants the rights described here.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to access your personal information</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.</p>
<p>You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to rectification of personal data</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete. We will make reasonable efforts to revise any information that is incorrect, or update or change your information as we are required to do by applicable law.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to restrict the processing of personal data</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.<br />
<br />
o The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to request deletion of personal data</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You may request the erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may request erasure if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">o You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims. </p>
<p>If you exercise your right to erasure, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to object to processing of personal data for specific purposes</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.</p>
<p>You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right to withdraw your consent</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Where you have provided your consent to us for processing your information, you can withdraw this at any time by opting out in your SkyMiles Profile, or by contacting us at https://www.delta.com/contactus/commentComplaint.</p>
<p>You may also contact us by using the Email Us page or by calling our Customer Care Offices at +1-800-455-2720.  Assistance for those with disabilities is available at +1-404- 209-3434.</p>
<p><b>9. Exercising These Rights</b></p>
<p>In order to exercise the rights described in this section, you must submit a request in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation of Law No. 29733. Any request you make must be in writing and include your name and address and any other information that may identify you, such as where your request relates to a travel booking, please provide your booking reference (e.g., confirmation number or record locator number), SkyMiles Account number if you have one, the dates on which the travel took place, and any other relevant information that will assist us to identify your booking. You must also provide a photocopy of your passport or driver’s license so we can verify your identity. Please send your written requests to our Data Protection Officer by emailing us at Privacy@delta.com.</p>
<p><b>10. Security</b></p>
<p>Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, misuse, alteration, and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data. </p>
<p><b>11. Complaints to Regulator</b></p>
<p>You have a right to file a complaint with the National Authority of Personal Data Protection by addressing the front desk of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (Calle Scipión Llona 350, Miraflores, Lima Peru) in connection with your rights under this Privacy Policy.</p>
