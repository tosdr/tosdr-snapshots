<div class="container globalanchorchk textdescription"><p><strong><a id="gen"></a>RULE 1</strong>: <u><strong>General Provisions<br />
 </strong></u><strong>A.  Contract of Carriage<br />
 </strong>When you buy a ticket for travel on Delta, you enter into a contract with us, and you agree to be bound by its terms. The terms of your contract (the “Contract of Carriage”) are set forth in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your ticket;</li>
<li>these Conditions of Carriage; and</li>
<li>our published fare rules and regulations, which may govern the calculation of the fare and other charges that apply to your itinerary (“Fare Rules”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Delta Air Lines International Conditions of Carriage are listed below. For past date conditions of carriage, please <a href="mailto:Carriage.Delta@delta.com">email us</a> specifying which tariff you are requesting and the date of your ticket purchase.<br />
<br />
This document is Delta's International Conditions of Carriage. It applies to travel on any itinerary for International Carriage and states the terms upon which Delta offers to transport passengers. Travel entirely within the United States of America is governed by Delta's Domestic General Rules Tariff. Travel between the United States and Canada is governed by our Canadian General Rules Tariff.<br />
<br />
Any reference to “Delta” in this contract refers to Delta Air Lines, the Delta Shuttle, and the Delta Connection carriers. Some flights marketed by Delta may be operated by other Carriers. If any Carrier other than Delta Air Lines is operating a flight, we will identify that Carrier in our schedules and in written or oral communications with you during the booking process. The terms of transportation applicable to Delta specified in these Conditions of Carriage also apply to flights operated by the Delta Connection and Delta Shuttle carriers, and to codeshare flights where Delta is the Marketing Carrier.</p>
<p>Delta may act as an agent to issue tickets, check baggage and book reservations for transportation via other Carriers which have interline agreements with Delta. For interline flights operated by other Carriers, the conditions of carriage of the operating Carrier will apply. Other Carriers may have different terms and conditions applicable to their flights, and these may be obtained directly from the other Carriers.</p>
<p>Some provisions of these Conditions of Carriage apply only to residents or passengers traveling to select countries or regions. All country- and region-specific rules and requirements are set forth in <a href="/us/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-igr#rule27">Rule 27</a> of these Conditions of Carriage.B. Amendments to Conditions of Carriage<br />
<br />
<strong>B.  Amendments to Conditions of Carriage<br />
 <br />
 </strong>Delta may amend these Conditions of Carriage at any time, except as provided by law. Your travel is governed by the rules that were in effect on the date you purchased your ticket; provided, however, that Delta reserves the right to apply rules currently in effect on the date of your travel where reasonably necessary for operational reasons and where the change in rule does not have a material negative impact upon you. No Delta employee or ticketing agent has the authority to modify any provision of the Conditions of Carriage unless authorized in writing by a Delta corporate officer.<br />
<strong><br />
 <a id="sando"></a>RULE 2:  <u>SCHEDULES AND OPERATIONS<br />

Delta may substitute alternate Carriers or aircraft, change its schedules, delay or cancel flights, change seat assignments, and alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket as required by its operations in Delta’s sole discretion. Delta’s sole liability in the event of such changes is set forth in Rule 23.  Delta is not responsible or liable for making connections, failing to operate any flight according to schedule, changing the schedule or any flight, changing seat assignments or aircraft types, or revising the routings by which Delta carries the passenger from the ticketed origin to destination.<br />

 </u></strong>The passenger recognizes that personal data has been given to Carrier for the purposes of making a reservation for carriage, obtaining ancillary services, facilitating immigration and entry requirements, and making available such data to government agencies. For these purposes, where required by law, the passenger authorizes Carrier to retain such data and to transmit it to its own offices, other Carriers, or the providers of such services, in whatever country they may be located.  All passenger information shall be handled in accordance with Delta’s Privacy Policy <a class="rte-non-external" href="https://www.delta.com/en_US/privacy-and-security">(https://www.delta.com/en_US/privacy-and-security)</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong> <a id="iat"></a>RULE 5: <u>INTER-AIRPORT TRANSPORTATION<br />
 <br />
 </u></strong>Except as otherwise specified below, Delta does not operate or provide ground transfer service between airports or between airports and city centers. When a metropolitan area is served by more than one airport and the passenger requires connecting service with arrival at one airport and departure from another airport, transportation between those airports must be arranged by and at the expense of the passenger. Any such service is performed by independent operators who are not and shall not be deemed to be agents or servants of Delta.  Although Delta may assist you in making arrangements for such ground transfer service, you agree that Delta is not liable for any act or omission of any such independent operator.  If Delta issues you a voucher to cover the cost of services provided by any such independent contractor and you decide not to use the services, the voucher for such services will have no refund or cash value.<br />
<br />
When transferring between airports, baggage must be claimed and rechecked by the passenger.<br />
<strong><br />

<br />
B) Acceptance of Declaration of Self-Reliance<br />
<br />
Unless Delta determines a Safety Assistant is essential for safety, pursuant to Rule 6(C), Delta will accept the determination made by or on behalf of a Person with a Disability as to self-reliance.  Once advised that the person is Self-reliant, Delta shall not refuse such passenger transportation on the basis that the Person with a Disability is not accompanied by a Personal Attendant or based on the assumption that the passenger may require extraordinary assistance from airline employees in meeting the passenger’s needs.<br />
<br />
<a id="rule6C"></a>C) Accompanying Safety Assistant Required for Certain Passengers<br />

<p>D) Medical Clearance</p>
<p>Delta will not require a medical clearance for a Person with a Disability as a condition of travel, except as permitted by law. Delta may require a medical certificate when, in good faith and using its reasonable discretion, Delta determines there is reasonable doubt that a passenger can complete the flight safely without requiring extraordinary medical assistance.</p>
<p>E) Seating Restrictions and Assignments</p>
<p>When a person identifies the nature of his or her disability, Delta will, to the extent possible, accommodate the passenger with a seat assignment that suits the passenger’s needs, including seating the passenger together with any Safety Assistant or Personal Attendant traveling with the passenger.

Delta will permit the service Animal to accompany the person onboard the aircraft and to remain on the floor at the person’s seat. The service Animal will not be permitted to occupy a passenger seat. To the extent permitted or required by law, Delta reserves the right to deny transportation to any service animal when reasonably necessary, in Delta’s sole discretion, for the comfort or safety of passengers or crewmembers or for the prevention of damage to the property of Delta or its passengers or employees.</p>

<p>L) Communication and Confirmation of Information</p>
<p>Delta will use reasonable efforts to ensure that announcements to passengers concerning stops, delays, schedule changes, connections, on-board services, and claiming baggage are communicated to any person with a disability in a manner sufficient for the person to understand the communication.</p>
<p>M) Inquire Periodically</p>
<p>When passengers in wheelchairs that are not independently mobile are waiting to board an aircraft, Delta will inquire periodically about their needs and shall attend to those needs where the services required are usually provided by Delta.</p>
<p><strong><a id="refusal"></a>RULE 7: REFUSAL TO TRANSPORT</strong></p>
<p>Delta may refuse to transport any passenger, and may remove any passenger from its aircraft at any time, for any of the following reasons:</p>

E) Failure to Comply with Delta’s Rules or Contract of Carriage</p>
<p>When a passenger or the ticket purchaser (or his or her respective agent or travel agency) fails or refuses to comply with any of Delta’s rules or regulations, or any term of the Contract of Carriage.</p>
<p>F) Passenger’s Conduct or Condition</p>
<p>Delta will not refuse to provide transportation to a Person with a Disability, as defined in 14 C.F.R. § 382.5 and 382.31, based upon the passenger’s disability, except as allowed or required by law. Delta will not refuse to provide transportation based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or ancestry. Subject to those qualifications, Delta may refuse to transport any passenger, or may remove any passenger from its aircraft, when refusal to transport or removal of the passenger is reasonably necessary in Delta’s sole discretion for the passenger’s comfort or safety, for the comfort or safety of other passengers or Delta employees, or for the prevention of damage to the property of Delta or its passengers or employees. By way of example, and without limitation, Delta may refuse to transport or may remove passengers from its aircraft in any of the following situations:</p>

<p>G) Recourse of Passenger</p>
<p>Passengers, ticket purchasers, and their respective agents and travel agencies shall not engage in any conduct that would authorize Delta to refuse transport under this Rule. The sole recourse of any passenger refused carriage or removed for any reason specified in this Rule shall be recovery of the refund value of the unused portion of his or her ticket, as calculated in accordance with Rule 23.</p>
<p><strong><a id="accept"></a>RULE 8: <u>ACCEPTANCE OF CHILDREN</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>A)   Accompanied Children</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) General Rule</strong></p>
<p>Except as set forth in this Rule, children under the age of 15 will not be accepted for transportation unless they are accompanied on the same flight in the same cabin by a parent, legal guardian, or other passenger at least 18 years of age. Delta may require documentation verifying the child’s age at check-in. A valid passport, birth certificate or other government-issued identification are all acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Accompanied Children Less Than 2 Years Old.</strong></p>
<p>One child less than 2 years old not occupying a seat may travel with an Applicable Full Fare-paying passenger at least 18 years old or parent/legal guardian upon payment of the applicable infant-in-arms fare (including taxes). Additional infants, and infants occupying a seat, must pay the Applicable Full Fare. A maximum of 2 infants is permitted for each adult. Delta recommends that any child occupying a seat be placed in an approved safety seat. Infants who will reach their second birthday during a journey must occupy a seat and pay the Applicable Full Fare for the entire journey.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Accompanied Children 2 Years and Older</strong></p>
<p>The fare for children ages 2 years and older will be the Applicable Full Fare.</p>
<p><strong>B)  Unaccompanied Children Under the age of 15.</strong></p>
<p>Children under the age of 15 may travel unaccompanied on Delta only under the following conditions:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Children under the age of 5</strong></p>
<p>No child under the age of 5 will be accepted for unaccompanied travel.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Children aged 5 through 14</strong></p>
<p>Children ages 5 through 7 may travel unaccompanied on non-stop flights only and may not connect to other airlines. Children ages 8 through 14 may travel unaccompanied on Delta’s non-stop or connecting flights, but may not connect to other airlines with the exception of Delta Connection, KLM, Air France, and Aeromexico.</p>
<p><strong>C)   Unaccompanied Minor Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) When Unaccompanied Minor Service is Required</strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Rule, Unaccompanied Minor Service is required for all passengers under the age of 15 that Delta accepts for transportation.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Unaccompanied Minor Service Defined</strong></p>
<p>Unaccompanied Minor Service means that Delta will provide supervision for the child from the time of boarding until the child is met at the stop over point or destination. Delta will assume no financial or guardianship responsibilities for unaccompanied children beyond those applicable to an adult passenger. Delta has the right, but is not obligated to require identification of the responsible party meeting the child at a transfer point or final destination. An unaccompanied minor must be confirmed to destination and may not be confirmed on the last connecting flight of the evening (with the exception of markets where there is only one connection and it is the last flight of the day, or for flights to or from Alaska or Hawaii), nor may an unaccompanied minor travel on a flight expected to terminate short of, or bypass, the child’s destination. Delta requires that a parent or responsible adult accompany the child until boarding, and this adult must provide the name, telephone number, and address of the party meeting the child at the transfer point or final destination. Delta reserves the right to refuse to release an unaccompanied child to anyone other than the pre-designated party. Delta representatives cannot administer medicine to children flying alone. An unaccompanied minor may not travel on any domestic flight greater than 2 hours in length which departs between 9 PM and 5 AM (“red-eye flight”). This restriction does not apply for red-eye flights to/from Hawaii and Alaska, however, an unaccompanied minor on a red-eye flight from Hawaii or Alaska may not connect to a domestic red-eye flight or to the last flight of the day unless it is the only flight option for the day.</p>
<p><strong>D)  Unaccompanied Children Ages 15-17</strong></p>
<p>Although not required, a parent or guardian may request Unaccompanied Minor Service for unaccompanied minors ages 15-17. The applicable unaccompanied minor service charge will apply.</p>
<p><strong>E)   Unaccompanied Minor Service Charge</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the applicable fare, unaccompanied minors for whom Unaccompanied Minor Service is required or has been requested must pay an unaccompanied minor service charge in the amounts set forth below. Delta reserves the right to refuse to transport any unaccompanied minor for whom Unaccompanied Minor Services are required or requested but for whom the applicable unaccompanied minor service fee has not been paid. If 2 or more unaccompanied minors who are members of the same Immediate Family and ticketed together are traveling together, only one service charge will be assessed.</p>
<p>The <a href="/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program"><strong>unaccompanied minor service charge</strong></a> is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p><strong>F)   Suspension of Unaccompanied Minor Travel<br />
 <br />
 </strong>Delta may temporarily suspend unaccompanied minor travel and/or rebook the child on an alternate flight if there is a possibility that weather, irregular operations, or other conditions may cause a flight to be diverted. For the avoidance of doubt, this rule also applies to unaccompanied children ages 15-17 who have not requested Unaccompanied Minor Service. If Delta refuses to transport an unaccompanied minor under these circumstances, Rule 7(G) of these Conditions of Carriage shall govern.</p>
<p><strong>G)</strong>   <strong>Proof of Permission to Travel</strong></p>
<p>Minors at least (12) years of age but under (18) years of age traveling unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians will be required to satisfy the office or agency booking such ticket that their parents or legal guardians are aware of their travel and have given their permission for such travel and to leave their country of origin. If time permits prior to departure, a statement in writing to that effect will be required from parents or guardian and if the travel is international, the statement must also say that the minor(s) will be visiting and in the charge of responsible person(s) while in the country of destination. If reservation has been made so near departure time that written statement cannot be obtained, then oral assurance from the parent or legal guardian will be required.</p>
<p><strong><a id="dogs"></a>RULE 9: <u>SPECIALLY TRAINED SERVICE DOGS</u></strong></p>
<p>Delta accepts for transportation, without charge, dogs trained: (1) to lead the blind, when the dog accompanies a passenger with impaired vision dependent upon such dog; (2) to assist the deaf, when the dog accompanies a passenger with impaired hearing dependent upon such dog; (3) to assist the physically and psychiatrically impaired passengers dependent upon such dog, or (4) in explosive detection or search and rescue, only when such dogs are accompanied by U.S. military and U.S. government handlers. In the cases of (1) and (2) above, Delta will also accept such dogs when accompanied by the dog’s trainer and is en-route to the domicile of the owner for completion of training. In all cases, the service dog will be permitted to accompany such passenger into the cabin but will not be permitted to occupy a seat.</p>
<p><strong><a id="smoke"></a>RULE 10: SMOKE FREE SERVICE<br />
 </strong><br />
 Delta prohibits smoking and the use of all smokeless tobacco products (including e-cigarettes and vapes) on all flights.</p>

 </strong><br />
On flights operated by Delta or a Delta Connection carrier, only portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) approved by the FAA are accepted for inflight medical oxygen. A 48-hour notice is required. Please see  <a class="rte-non-external" href="/us/en/accessible-travel-services/assistive-devices-medication">Assistive Devices &amp; Medication | Delta Air Lines</a> to obtain information regarding the required medical certificate from a licensed physician and medical screening prior to flight. Medical screening service is provided by Delta at no cost to the passenger. If the passenger makes any voluntary change to his/her itinerary after completion of the medical screening, re-screening may be required. Passengers using POCs on a Delta flight must be seated in a row other than an emergency exit or bulkhead.</p>
<p><strong><a id="tick"></a>RULE 12: <u>TICKETS</u></strong></p>
<p>A) You must present a valid ticket for transportation, which entitles you to transportation only between points of origin and destination via the ticketed routing.</p>
<p>B) Tickets are not transferable. The purchaser of the ticket and the passenger are responsible for ensuring that the ticket accurately states the passenger's name. Presentation of a ticket for transportation by someone other than the passenger named on the ticket renders the ticket void.</p>
<p>C) Tickets are valid for travel only when used in accordance with all terms and conditions of sale.</p>
<p>D) Where a ticket is invalidated as the result of the passenger's non-compliance with the Contract of Carriage, Delta may:</p>
<p>1) Cancel any remaining portion of the passenger's itinerary or bookings,</p>
<p>2) Confiscate any unused portion of the ticket,</p>
<p>3) Refuse to board the passenger or check the passenger's baggage, and/or</p>
<p>4) Assess the passenger for the reasonable remaining value of the ticket, which shall be no less than the difference between the fare actually paid and the lowest fare applicable to the passenger's actual itinerary.</p>
<p>E)  Ticket Expiration</p>
<p>A ticket is valid for one year from the original date of issuance and travel must commence within this validity period. Once travel has commenced then all travel must be completed within one year from the date on which travel commenced.</p>
<p>If a ticket is exchanged or reissued-</p>
<p>a)     A wholly unused ticket must be exchanged within the original validity period of one year and will be given a new ticket issue date, but retaining the original validity period, based on the date of exchange. Travel must commence within the original validity period and all travel be completed within one year of the date on which travel commenced.</p>
<p>b)    If travel has commenced within the original validity period, then the ticket must be reissued and all travel completed within one year from the date on which travel commenced.<br />
<br />
Note – certain fares may have different periods of validity, in which case the specific rules associated with the fare will take precedence.</p>
<p>If the passenger is prevented from using the ticket, or a portion of the ticket, before the expiration date due to lack of space or flight cancellation, the ticket will remain valid until space can be provided.</p>
<p>F)   An electronic ticket (E-Ticket/ET) is the record of agreement maintained and processed within the Carrier’s electronic reservation system. A written receipt is provided to the purchaser of the electronic ticket which contains a reference for retrieving the record within the Carrier’s reservation system and summary of the ticket information. The Carrier may mandate the issuance of an electronic ticket (ET) regardless of market, Carrier, form of payment, and customer type (including SkyMiles and participating Carrier frequent flyer members)</p>
<p>G)   External Reissue Charge</p>
<p>Delta will collect a nonrefundable fee of USD $50.00 for reissue by Delta of tickets originally issued in the United States or Canada by any ticketing source other than Delta, however, the charge does not apply to same day confirmed transactions, irregular operations (as designated by Delta in its sole discretion) or schedule change situations, SkyMiles upgrade reissues, tickets reissued on delta.com, or tickets issued at military or government fares. This fee applies to all changes to tickets issued at the request of the passenger.</p>
<p>H)   Additional Ticketing Fees</p>
<p>In addition to the otherwise applicable fare, for tickets purchased directly from Delta Reservations in Europe, Delta will collect at the time of ticketing an additional ticketing fee, as set forth at delta.com (currently available at <a class="rte-non-external" href="https://www.delta.com/en_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/before-your-trip/checked#DirectTicketing">https://www.delta.com/en_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/before-your-trip/checked#DirectTicketing</a>). This additional charge is not refundable and shall be included in the total fare quoted to the passenger at the time of ticketing. These additional charges do not apply to tickets purchased directly from Delta at delta.com.</p>
<p>I)    Capacity Limitations</p>
<p>Delta will limit the number of passengers carried on any one flight in any fare class or cabin, and such fares and fare classes will not necessarily be available on all flights or in all markets. The number of seats which Delta makes available on a given flight is determined by Delta’s best judgment of the anticipated total passenger load on each flight.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><a id="cor"></a>RULE 13: <u>CONFIRMATION OF RESERVATIONS</u></strong></p>
<p>No reservation on Delta is valid until the availability and allocation of the reserved space is confirmed by Delta or its agent and entered in Delta’s electronic reservations system.</p>
<p>Unless an earlier ticketing deadline is imposed by the applicable fare rule or other agreement between Delta and the passenger, Delta must receive payment and the reservation must be ticketed at least 60 minutes prior to the scheduled flight departure time. Failure to comply with this ticketing deadline or an earlier ticketing deadline imposed by the applicable fare rule or other agreement with the passenger will result in cancellation of the reservation without notice. A list of airports imposing an earlier ticketing deadline is set forth at delta.com/checkin and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p><strong><a id="caor"></a>RULE 14: <u>CANCELLATION OF RESERVATIONS</u></strong></p>
<p>A)  <u>Delta Will Cancel</u> reservations of any passenger whenever such action is necessary to comply with any law or governmental regulation, directive or request, or to comply with any governmental request for emergency transportation, or whenever such action is necessary or advisable by reason of weather or other conditions beyond its control.</p>
<p>B)  The Transportation Security Agency’s (TSA) Secure Flight Program requires that Delta collect the following additional information from passengers when making a reservation to fly within, into or out of the United States and reservations for point-to-point international flights operated by U.S.- based airlines:</p>
<p>1) Full Name (required), as it appears on government-issued I.D. approved for use when traveling<br />
2) Date of Birth (required)<br />

This cancellation policy applies to all Delta tickets, including tickets for flights operated by our codeshare partners. </p>
<p>C)   <u>Failure To Appear</u></p>
<p>If you fail to appear for any flight in your itinerary without giving Delta notice in advance of the departure of the flight, Delta may cancel your reservation for all remaining flights in your itinerary.</p>
<p>D)   <u>Airport Check-In Time Limits</u></p>
<p>1) Reservations Subject to Cancellation for Failure to Meet Check-in and Boarding Deadlines</p>
<p>Your reservation may be cancelled if you do not comply with all applicable check-in procedures by the check-in deadline for your flight, or if you are not at the gate and ready for boarding by the applicable boarding deadline. The check-in and boarding deadlines in effect on the date of travel will apply and are posted on delta.com.</p>
<p>2) Passenger Responsibility to Allow Sufficient Time</p>
<p>You must arrive at the airport with sufficient time to comply with all check-in procedures, complete security screening, comply with all other government requirements and departure processing, and arrive at the gate by the applicable boarding deadline.  Delta will not delay flights for passengers who are not at the gate and ready to board on time and is not liable for any loss or expense due to the passenger’s failure to comply with this provision.<br />
<br />
<strong><a id="fare"></a>RULE 15: <u>FARES</u></strong></p>
<p>A) Fares Applicable Only For Ticketed Itinerary</p>
<p>Fares apply for travel only between the points for which they are published. Tickets may not be issued at fare(s) published to and/or from a more distant point(s) than the points being traveled, even when issuance of such tickets may produce a lower fare.</p>
<p>B) Erroneous Fares</p>
<p>Delta will exercise reasonable efforts to ensure that all fares it publishes are accurate and available for sale, but Delta, as a policy, does not file nor intend to file tickets priced at a zero fare or that are erroneous or reasonably apparent as erroneous. If an erroneous fare is inadvertently published for sale and a ticket is issued at the erroneous fare before it has been corrected, Delta reserves the right to cancel the ticket purchase and refund all amounts paid by the purchaser or, at the purchaser’s option, to reissue the ticket for the correct fare.</p>
<p>In this event, Delta will also reimburse any reasonable, actual, nonrefundable and verifiable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the purchaser in reliance upon the ticket purchase. The purchaser must provide receipts or other evidence of such actual costs incurred in support of any reimbursement request.</p>
<p>C) Circumvention of Published Fares</p>
<p>Delta prohibits ticketing practices intended to circumvent the published fare that Delta intends to offer for your true itinerary. These practices include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1) Back to Back Ticketing - The purchase or usage of two or more tickets issued at round trip fares, or the combination of two or more round trip fares end to end on the same ticket.</p>
<p>2) Throwaway Ticketing - The purchase or usage of round trip fares for one way travel.</p>
<p>3) Hidden City/Point Beyond Ticketing - The purchase or usage of a fare from a point before the passenger's actual origin or to a point beyond the passenger's actual destination.</p>
<p>If the passenger, ticket purchaser, or their respective agents or travel agencies have engaged in a prohibited ticketing practice contemplated by this Rule 15(C), Delta reserves the right to cancel any unused portion of the passenger’s ticket, void any remaining value of the unused portion of the ticket, refuse to let the passenger board or check bags, and/or, if the passenger is permitted to board, charge the passenger the Applicable Full Fare.</p>
<p>D)  When the fare between any 2 points is not specifically published via the desired routing, the fare will be constructed by combining two or more separate fares, via the desired routing from the passenger’s point of origin to point of destination, which produce the lowest fare for the class of service used; provided, however, that combined fare will not exceed the lowest fare determined in accordance with this rule and the applicable fare rules.  Delta’s direct sales channels will offer customers the lowest applicable published fare for itineraries on Delta, Delta Connection, Delta Shuttle and Delta Codeshare flights for the flights, dates and class of service requested to which our representatives have access. In some instances, customers may need to select a preferred itinerary before the lowest published fare and additional fare price options are displayed for that itinerary. Please note that Delta will quote the lowest published fare that we offer for the specific airports and type of itinerary that you request. We do not search for or quote fares for other itineraries, including by combining one-way or other fares. Fares not accessible directly from Delta may include, but are not limited to, unpublished fares, consolidator fares, negotiated fares, tour or package fares, and discounts available only via Internet web sites.</p>
<p>E) Duplicate, Fictitious and Impossible/Illogical Bookings</p>
<p>Delta prohibits duplicate, impossible, or fictitious bookings, including but not limited to multiple conflicting itineraries for the same passenger on the same day or bookings with connections that depart before the arrival of the inbound flight. In connection with any non-compliance with this Rule, Delta reserves the right to:</p>

b) The Carrier shall make the advance payment as an advance against the Carrier’s liability under the Warsaw Convention, or the Montreal Convention, whichever may apply. An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability. An advance payment shall be offset against, or deducted from the payment of, any settlement or judgment with respect to any claim for compensation on behalf of the passenger.<br />
c) The Carrier, in making an advance payment, does not waive any rights, defenses, or limitations available under the Warsaw Convention, or the Montreal Convention, whichever may apply, to any claim on behalf of the passenger, nor shall acceptance of an advance payment constitute a release of any claim, whatsoever, by any person.<br />
d) The Carrier, in making an advance payment, preserves its right to seek contribution or indemnity from any other person for such payment, which shall not be deemed to be voluntary contribution or contractual payment on the part of the Carrier.<br />

<p>3) The Carrier shall be liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage of passengers by air, as provided in the following paragraphs:</p>

<p>b) Normal carrier limit of liability will be waived for substantiated claims involving loss, damage, or delay in delivery to mobility aids such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, scooters and other mobility aid, when such items have been accepted into the care of the carrier as checked baggage or otherwise. The liability of carrier for substantiated claims involving the loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of mobility aids, when such items have been accepted as checked baggage or otherwise, is based on the cost of the repair or replacement value of the mobility aid. For damaged or delayed wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, scooters and other mobility aids if a damaged aid can be repaired, Carrier will arrange, at its expense, for the prompt and adequate repair of the aid and for its return to the passenger as soon as reasonably possible.

<p>H) RULES SPECIFIC TO CODESHARE OPERATIONS<br />
</p>
<p>Some flight segments in your itinerary may be operated by airlines other than Delta pursuant to contractual codeshare arrangements with Delta that allow Delta to sell tickets for travel on flights operated by these Carriers (“Delta Codeshare Partners”). If you purchase a Delta ticket where Delta is the Marketing Carrier (your flight has a Delta flight number), your Contract of Carriage is with Delta regardless of the Operating Carrier. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract of Carriage, the following rules will apply to flights operated by Delta Codeshare Partners:</p>
<p><strong>1. Baggage</strong></p>
<p>For itineraries in which at least one segment is operated by a Delta Codeshare Partner, only standard-sized baggage (not to exceed a maximum outside linear dimension of 62 inches (157 cm) or a maximum weight of 50 lbs. (23 kg)) will be accepted. These more restrictive rules apply throughout the whole itinerary, including flights operated by Delta. One carry-on bag not exceeding 11 pounds (5 kg) and 46 linear inches (117 cm) is also permitted.</p>
<p><strong>2. Unaccompanied Minors</strong></p>
<p>No unaccompanied minors will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>3. Carriage of Animals</strong></p>
<p>No animals (other than service animals, emotional support animals, and animals owned by members of the U.S. military and their families who are traveling on active transfer orders) will be accepted. With regard to emotional support animals, the policy of the Operating Carrier will govern.  Please consult with the Operating Carrier for the applicable policy regarding acceptance and carriage of emotional support animals.</p>
<p><strong>4. Check-In Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Minimum check-in time of 2 hours will apply, except in the case of, Istanbul, Turkey (3 hour, 15 minute minimum).</p>
<p><strong>5. Extended Tarmac Delays – Codeshare Services</strong></p>
<p>In the event of extended tarmac delays on flights operated by a Delta Codeshare Partner, the contingency plan for lengthy tarmac delays of the Operating Carrier will apply.</p>
<p><strong>6. Additional Services Provided by Delta Codeshare Partners</strong></p>
<p>Delta Codeshare Partners may, in their discretion, accept more, larger or heavier items of checked baggage, accept specialty baggage items, accept additional carry-on items, accept unaccompanied minors, accept animals in the cabin or as cargo, and permit later check-in times. The Delta Codeshare Partner may charge a fee for any additional discretionary services it provides.  Any additional services provided at the discretion of the Delta Codeshare Partner are not within Delta’s control, are subject to change at any time, and do not form any part of the Contract of Carriage between you and Delta.</p>
<p><strong><a id="elec"></a>RULE 19: <u>ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE</u></strong></p>
<p>Passengers and their baggage are subject to inspection with an electronic detector with or without the passenger's consent or knowledge.</p>
<p><strong><a id="flight"></a>RULE 20: <u>FLIGHT DELAYS/CANCELLATIONS</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Delta’s Liability in the Event of Schedule Changes, Delays and Flight Cancellations</strong></p>
<p>If there is a flight cancellation, diversion, or delay of greater than 120 minutes or that will cause a passenger to miss connections, Delta will (at passenger’s request) cancel the remaining ticket and refund the unused portion of the ticket and unused ancillary fees in the original form of payment in accordance with Rule 23.  If the passenger does not request cancellation and refund of the remaining portion of the ticket, Delta will transport the passenger to the destination on Delta’s next flight on which seats are available in the class of service originally purchased. At Delta’s sole discretion and if acceptable to the passenger, Delta may arrange for the passenger to travel on another Carrier or via ground transportation. If acceptable to the passenger, Delta may provide transportation in a lower class of service, in which case the passenger may be entitled to a partial refund. If space on the next available flight is available only in a higher class of service than purchased, Delta will transport the passenger on the flight, although Delta reserves the right to upgrade other passengers on the flight according to its upgrade priority policy to make space in the class of service originally purchased. Delta will not be liable under any circumstances for any special, incidental or consequential damages arising from the foregoing.</p>
<p><strong>B. Delta’s Liability for Additional Amenities in the Event of Schedule Changes, Delays and Flight Cancellations</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided above, Delta shall have no liability if the flight cancellation, diversion or delay was due to force majeure. As used in this rule, “force majeure” means actual, threatened or reported:</p>
<p>(1) Weather conditions or acts of God;<br />
(2) Riots, civil unrest, embargoes, war, hostilities, or unsettled international conditions;<br />
(3) Strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockout, or any other labor-related dispute;<br />
(4) Government regulation, demand, directive or requirement;<br />
(5) Shortages of labor, fuel, or facilities; or<br />
(6) Any other condition beyond Delta’s control or any fact not reasonably foreseen by Delta.<br />
<br />
However, when a passenger’s travel is interrupted for more than 4 hours after the scheduled departure time as a result of flight cancellation or delay on the date of travel other than from force majeure, Delta will provide the passenger with the following additional amenities during the delay:<br />
<strong><br />
 (a) Hotels</strong></p>

Delta will provide free public ground transportation to the hotel if the hotel does not offer such service. If accommodations are not available, Delta will provide the passenger with a voucher that may be applied to future travel on Delta equal in value to the contracted hotel rate, up to $100 USD.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Ground Transportation</strong></p>
<p>In lieu of lodging or other amenities, Delta may furnish ground transportation to the destination airport if a passenger’s flight is diverted to an alternative airport and if the destination on the ticket and the diverted airport destination are within the following city groups:</p>

Such amenities will be furnished consistent with special needs and/or circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><a id="dbc"></a>RULE 21: DENIED BOARDING COMPENSATION<br />
 <br />
 </strong>A) <u>Overbooking of Flights<br />
 <br />
 </u>Because passengers with confirmed reservations on a flight sometimes fail to show, Delta reserves the right to sell more tickets for travel on each flight than there are seats available on the aircraft. In some cases, this may result in a flight in which Delta cannot accommodate one or more passengers with confirmed reservations (an “oversold flight”). Delta may deny boarding to passengers with confirmed reservations on an oversold flight as set forth in this Rule. The rights of passengers who are denied boarding shall be governed by this Rule.</p>
<p>B) <u>Request For Volunteers</u></p>
<p>Before denying boarding to any passenger holding a confirmed reservation on an oversold flight, Delta will ask other passengers on the flight to voluntarily give up their seat in exchange for compensation in an amount and form to be determined by Delta in its sole discretion. If a sufficient number of volunteers agree to give up their seats in response to Delta’s offer, then no passenger with a confirmed reservation will be involuntarily denied boarding due to the oversale of the flight. If there are more volunteers than required, selection of the volunteer(s) to receive compensation will be determined in Delta’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>C) <u>Involuntary Denied Boardin</u>g</p>
<p>If an insufficient number of passengers volunteer to give up their seats in response to Delta’s offer, Delta may involuntarily deny boarding to one or more passengers on the oversold flight according to the following boarding priority rules:</p>
<p>1) Passengers Holding Tickets for Travel in Premium Cabin, SkyMiles members identified with a Diamond Medallion (“DM”), Platinum Medallion (“PM”), or Gold Medallion (“GM”) elite-status designation, and passengers holding tickets purchased under a DL corporate travel agreement.</p>

 <br />
 </u>Subject to the terms set forth in Rule 20(c)(1) and (4), passengers holding boarding passes who check in and present themselves at the departure gate in compliance with Rule 13 will be accommodated before passengers traveling in the same cabin who have not been issued boarding passes or who fail to comply with applicable check-in requirements. Subject to the availability of seats on the aircraft, boarding passes may be obtained by passengers who hold tickets for confirmed reserved space in the following manner:</p>
<p>a) for passengers traveling on electronic tickets, through the Online Check-in feature on Delta.com within 24 hours of scheduled departure;</p>

<p>a) <u>Passenger’s Failure to Comply with Contract of Carriage<br />
 </u>The passenger has not complied fully with Delta’s Contract of Carriage or tariff provisions regarding ticketing, reconfirmation, check-in, or acceptability for transportation.</p>
<p>b) <u>Substitution of Equipment</u></p>
<p>The flight for which the passenger holds confirmed space is unable to accommodate that passenger because of substitution of equipment of lesser capacity when required by operational or safety reasons; or, on an aircraft with a designed passenger capacity of 60 or fewer seats, the flight for which the passenger holds confirmed reserved space is unable to accommodate that passenger due to weight/balance restrictions when required by operational or safety reasons.</p>
<p>c) <u>Carriage in Alternative Cabin</u></p>

<p>d) <u>Alternative Transportation</u></p>
<p>Delta arranges comparable air transportation, or other transportation used by the passenger, at no extra cost to the passenger, that at the time such arrangements are made is scheduled to arrive at the passenger’s next Stopover, or, if none, final destination within one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight or flights.</p>
<p>F) <u>Amount of Involuntary Denied Boarding Compensation</u></p>
<p>If all conditions for compensation are met, then Delta shall pay compensation to passengers involuntarily denied boarding in an amount to be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1) <u>When Delta arranges Qualifying Alternative Transportation</u><br />
If Delta arranges Qualifying Alternative Transportation, then Delta will pay denied boarding compensation in an amount equal to 200% of the fare (including any surcharges and air transportation taxes) to the passenger’s next Stopover, or if none, to his/her final destination, but no more than $775.00.</p>
<p>2) <u>Where Delta cannot arrange Qualifying Alternative Transportation</u><br />
If Delta cannot arrange Qualifying Alternative Transportation, then Delta will pay denied boarding compensation in an amount equal to 400% of the fare (including any surcharges and air transportation taxes) to the passenger’s next Stopover, or if none, to his/her final destination, but no more than $1,550.00.</p>
<p>G) <u>Time of Payment for Involuntary Denied Boarding Compensation</u><br />
If all conditions for compensation are met, Delta will pay any involuntary denied boarding compensation on the day and at the place where the denial of boarding occurred, in cash or immediately negotiable check; provided, however, that if the alternative transportation arranged for the passenger’s convenience departs before the payment can be made to the passenger, then payment will be made by mail or other means within 24 hours after the denied boarding occurs.</p>
<p>H) <u>Codeshare Services</u><br />
When involuntary denied boarding occurs on a flight operated by a Delta Codeshare Partner (an Operating Carrier), any passenger holding a ticket on such flight governed by these Rules is entitled to denied boarding compensation in accordance with this Rule (the Rules of the Marketing Carrier). Such compensation will generally be paid by the Operating Carrier at the time of denied boarding; provided however that the Operating Carrier may elect to reimburse the passenger in accordance with local laws, regulations or procedures that may differ from these guidelines in some cases. If the compensation actually paid is less than the amount required by this Rule, the passenger will be entitled upon request to Delta’s Customer Care department to payment from Delta in the amount of the difference between the compensation due under this Rule and the amount reimbursed by the Operating Carrier at the time of the denial of boarding.</p>

<p><strong> B. Voluntary Refunds</strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Nonrefundable Tickets</strong></p>

A refund of taxes, fees, or charges will cancel any remaining credit or value on the applicable ticket.  If you cancel or change your nonrefundable ticket prior to departure, subject to the applicable fare rules and other provisions of the Contract of Carriage, the value of the unused portion of a nonrefundable ticket (including taxes and government-imposed fees or charges), less applicable charges by Delta, may be applied toward the purchase of future travel on Delta, or to upgrade or downgrade those tickets after purchase.. Delta may charge an administrative service charge for processing any permitted changes to nonrefundable tickets, which will be deducted from any credit toward the purchase of future travel on Delta, or collected at the time the change is processed, as applicable.</p>
<p>By cancelling or changing your nonrefundable ticket prior to departure, (i) you authorize and consent to Delta receiving any available credit or refund of taxes and government-imposed fees or charges collected by Delta on the unused portion of the ticket, and (ii) Delta may charge a  fee, which will be deducted from any value available toward the purchase of future travel on Delta, or collected at the time the change is processed, as applicable. Any value from a nonrefundable ticket available for the purchase of future travel must be used and all travel completed within one year from the date of issue of the original ticket.</p>
<p>In the event of death of the passenger prior to the date of travel, tickets issued at nonrefundable fares will be refunded to the deceased passengers’ estate upon request. When a passenger is unable to travel due to the death of a member of his/her immediate family (traveling or not) or traveling companion, Delta may waive certain fare restrictions in accordance with its written policy. A death certificate/obituary notice to support the request must be submitted in all cases and is subject to verification by Delta.</p>
<p>If the passenger is unable to travel due to his/her illness or physical incapacity, Delta may waive certain fare restrictions in accordance with its written policy. This also applies to the immediate family (traveling or not) and traveling companion. The illness or physical incapacity must be certified in writing by a physician on his/her letterhead stationery verifying that the passenger could not travel on the date of travel because of illness or physical incapacity.</p>
<p><strong> 2. Fully Refundable Tickets</strong></p>
<p>If your ticket was purchased at a fare that is fully refundable, Delta will issue a refund of any unused refundable portion of your ticket at your request.  You must surrender any unused portion of the ticket at the time of the refund request. If a request for refund is not made, then subject to the fare rules and other provisions of the Contract of Carriage, the value of the unused portion of a refundable ticket (including taxes and government-imposed fees or charges) may be applied toward the purchase of future travel on Delta, or to upgrade or downgrade those tickets after purchase. The amount of the refund will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1. If <u>no portion</u> of the ticket has been used, Delta will refund the total fare and all taxes, fees or charges paid [or make such amount available to you toward the purchase of future travel].</p>
<p>2. If <u>a portion</u> of the ticket has been used, Delta will refund an amount equal to (a) the total fare and all taxes, fees or charges paid, minus (b) the fare and taxes, fees or charges for the used portion of the ticket.</p>
<p>By cancelling or changing your refundable ticket prior to departure, you authorize and consent to Delta receiving any available credit or refund of taxes and government-imposed fees or charges collected by Delta on the unused portion of the refundable ticket. Any value from a refundable ticket available for the purchase of future travel must be used and all travel completed within one year from the date of issue of the original ticket.</p>
<p><strong> C. Time Limit for Refund Requests</strong></p>
<p>No refund will be issued on any ticket unless Delta receives a request for the refund and any unused portions of the ticket are surrendered to Delta within one year of the original issue date of the ticket.</p>
<p><strong> D. Form of Refund</strong></p>
<p>Delta will issue refunds on eligible tickets as follows:</p>
<p>1. Tickets paid for by credit card will be refunded to the credit card account used to purchase the ticket, typically within seven business days of Delta's initial receipt of refund request.</p>
<p>2. Tickets paid for by cash, if cash is accepted by Delta, will be refunded by check issued to the person named as a passenger on the ticket, typically within 20 business days of Delta's receipt of initial refund request.</p>
<p>3. Tickets charged under a UATP (universal air travel plan) will be refunded to the subscriber against whose account the ticket was charged.</p>
<p>4. Tickets issued against governmental transportation requests shall be issued as required by applicable government regulation.</p>
<p>5. Tickets paid with any other form of payment will be issued back to the original form of payment.</p>
<p>6. All refunds will be subject to government laws, rules, regulations, or orders of the country in which the ticket was originally purchased and of the country in which the refund is being made.</p>
<p>7. Voluntary refunds of tickets purchased in currency other than U.S. dollars shall be made in the currency of the original purchase and in the country where such purchase was made. Voluntary refunds of tickets purchased in U.S. dollars may be made in U.S. dollars or local currency in any country, provided such refund is not prohibited by Applicable Law.</p>
<p>8. Involuntary refunds of tickets shall be made in the currency used for such purchase and in the country where such purchase was made, whenever possible. Upon the request of the passenger and where permitted by Applicable Law, Delta may in its sole discretion elect to issue the involuntary refund in USD currency or the currency of the country where the passenger is located at time of request.</p>
<p><strong> E. Overcharges</strong></p>
<p>No claims for overcharge shall be valid and DL shall have no liability if claim is more than 45 days after the date of issue of the ticket.</p>
<p><strong> F. No Refund on Tickets Used as Evidence of Return Travel</strong></p>
<p>Delta will not issue a refund on any ticket which has been presented to government officials of a country or to any carrier as evidence of intention to depart from that country unless the passenger establishes to Delta’s satisfaction that he or she has permission to remain in the country or will depart via another carrier or conveyance.</p>

<p><strong>D. <u>CANADA RESIDENTS – INTERLINE BAGGAGE RULES</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>D. Interline Baggage Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>&quot;Airline Designator Code&quot; is an identification code comprised of two-characters which is used for commercial and traffic purposes such as reservations, schedules, timetables, ticketing, tariffs and airport display systems. Airline designators are assigned by IATA. When this code appears on a ticket, it reflects the Carrier that is marketing the flight, which might be different from the Carrier operating the flight.</p>
<p>&quot;Baggage Rules&quot; are the conditions associated with the acceptance of baggage, services incidental to the transportation of baggage, allowances and all Related Charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Down Line Carrier&quot; is any Carrier, other than the Selecting Carrier, who is identified as providing interline transportation to the passenger by virtue of the passenger’s ticket. </p>
<p>&quot;Most Significant Carrier (MSC)&quot; is determined by a methodology, established by IATA (Resolution 302), which establishes, for each portion of a passenger's itinerary where baggage is checked through to a new stopover point, which Carrier will be performing the most significant part of the service. For travelers under the Resolution 302 system, the baggage rules of the MSC will apply. For complex itineraries involving multiple checked baggage points, there may be more than one MSC, resulting in the application of differing baggage rules through an itinerary.</p>
<p>&quot;Most Significant Carrier (MSC) – IATA Resolution 302 as conditioned by the CTA&quot; is determined by applying IATA Resolution 302 methodology as conditioned by the CTA. The CTA’s reservation has stipulated that only a single set of baggage rules may apply to any given interline itinerary. The aim of the CTA’s reservation is to allow the Selecting Carrier to use the MSC methodology to determine which Carrier's baggage rules apply to an international interline itinerary to or from Canada, while reinforcing the role of tariffs in the determination of which Carrier’s rules apply.</p>
<p>&quot;Participating Carrier(s)&quot; include both the Selecting Carrier and Down Line Carriers who have been identified as providing interline transportation to the passenger by virtue of the passenger’s ticket.</p>
<p>&quot;Selected Carrier&quot; is the Carrier whose baggage rules apply to the entire interline itinerary.</p>
<p>&quot;Selecting Carrier&quot; is the Carrier whose Airline Designator Code is identified on the first flight segment of the passenger’s ticket at the beginning of an interline itinerary issued on a single ticket whose origin or ultimate destination is in Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;Interline agreement&quot; is an agreement between two or more Carriers to co-ordinate the transportation of passengers and their baggage from the flight of one Carrier to the flight of another Carrier (through to the next point of stopover).</p>
<p>&quot;Interline itinerary&quot; means all flights reflected on a single ticket involving multiple Carriers. Only travel on a single ticket is subject to the CTA’s approach provided the origin or the ultimate ticketed destination is a point in Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;Interline travel&quot; is travel involving multiple Carriers listed on a single ticket that is purchased via a single transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Single ticket&quot; is a document that permits travel from origin to destination. It may include interline/code-share and intra-line segments. It may also include end-to-end combinations (i.e., stand-alone fares that can be bought separately but combined together to form one price).</p>
<p>&quot;Summary page at the end of an online purchase&quot; is a page on a Carrier’s website which summarizes the details of a ticket purchase transaction just after the passenger has agreed to purchase the ticket from the Carrier and has provided a form of payment.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimate ticketed destination&quot;: in situations where a passenger’s origin is a non-Canadian point and the itinerary includes at least one stop in Canada, as well as at least one stop outside of Canada. If the stop in Canada is the farthest checked point and the stop is more than 24 hours, the CTA would consider the ultimate ticketed destination to be Canada.  This rule is applicable to all interline itineraries issued on a single ticket whose origin or ultimate ticketed destination is in Canada. It establishes how the Carrier will determine which Carrier’s baggage rules apply to any passenger’s entire interline itinerary. For the purposes of interline baggage acceptance:</p>
<p>i. the Carrier whose Airline Designator Code is identified on the first segment of the passenger’s interline ticket will be known as the Selecting Carrier. <br />
ii. any Carrier who is identified as providing interline transportation to the passenger by virtue of the passenger’s ticket will be known as a “Participating Carrier”.</p>
<p>Baggage Rule Determination by Selecting Carrier</p>
<p>The Selecting Carrier will either (1) select and apply its own baggage rules as set out in its tariff to the entire interline itinerary or (2) select the Most Significant Carrier, as determined by IATA Resolution 302 and conditioned by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), in order for that Carrier’s baggage rules, as established in its tariff, to apply to the entire interline itinerary. The Carrier identified by Selecting Carrier will be known as the “Selected Carrier.”</p>
<p>When Delta Air Lines is the Selecting Carrier, Delta Air Lines will select the Most Significant Carrier, as determined by IATA Resolution 302 and conditioned by the CTA, in order for that Carrier’s baggage rule, as established in its tariff, to apply to the entire interline itinerary.</p>
<p>Each operating Carrier’s carry-on baggage allowances will apply to each flight segment in an interline itinerary. Notwithstanding, the carry-on baggage charges that will apply to the entire interline itinerary will be those of the Selected Carrier.</p>
<p>Baggage Rule Application by Participating Carrier<br />
Where Delta Air Lines is not the Selected Carrier on an interline itinerary but is a Participating Carrier that is providing transportation to the passenger based on the ticket issued, Delta Air Lines will apply as its own the baggage rules, with the exception of rules as to the acceptance of pets as checked baggage, of the Selected Carrier throughout the interline itinerary. As to the acceptance of pets as checked baggage, Delta’s rules will apply.</p>
<p>2. The Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada. If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (<a href="/us/en/legal/notices/canada-passenger-rights">www.delta.com/appr</a> (which is incorporated into this tariff by reference)) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.</p>
<p>Le Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens du Canada peut fournir des protections supplémentaires aux passagers voyageant à destination ou en provenance du Canada.  Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité. Pour plus d'informations sur vos droits de passagers, veuillez contacter votre transporteur aérien (<a href="/us/en/legal/notices/canada-passenger-rights">www.delta.com/appr</a> (qui est incorporé dans ce tarif par référence)) ou visitez le site Web de l'Office des transports du Canada.</p>
<p><strong>E. <u>CHINA RESIDENTS AND VISITORS –CONSUMER COMPLAINTS</u></strong></p>
<p>In compliance with applicable law, passengers originating from or connecting through the People’s Republic of China may direct any complaints or inquiries to <a href="mailto:wecare@delta.com"><strong>wecare@delta.com</strong></a> or the Delta Customer Care phone number: 400-120-2364 (China) or (800)221-1212 (USA).</p>
<p><strong>F.  <u>BRAZIL RESIDENTS AND VISITORS – LOST AND DELAYED BAGGAGE</u></strong></p>
<p>For baggage carried on international flights operated by Delta to and from Brazil only, and for Brazilian-domiciled persons, then in compliance with applicable law, Delta will reimburse passengers for reasonable items needed immediately while away from home without your luggage. To be reimbursed, passengers must provide Delta with a copy of the ticket receipt and baggage claim tags; and dated and itemized original receipts for reasonable items within 30 days of the luggage delay. If Delta does not locate the delayed luggage, any expense reimbursements will be deducted from the final settlement amount.</p>
