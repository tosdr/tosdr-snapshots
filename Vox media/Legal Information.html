          <h2 id="information-we-automatically-collect">Information We Automatically Collect</h2>

          <p><strong>Categories of Information.</strong> We and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services to help us understand how our users use the Services and to target advertising to you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “Usage Data”). For example, each time you visit the Services we and our third-party service providers may automatically collect your location, IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, Internet service provider used, clickstream information, access time, the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, the Web page(s) that you access during your visit and your interaction with content or advertising on the Services. We may contract with third parties to collect this information on our behalf for analytics purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>Purposes For This Information.</strong> We and our third-party service providers use such Usage Data for a variety of purposes including to diagnose problems with our servers and software, to administer the Services, to gather demographic information and to target advertising to you on the Services and elsewhere online. Accordingly, our third-party advertising networks and ad servers will also provide us with information, including reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the Services in a manner that does not identify personally any specific individual. The Usage Data we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="cookies-tracking-technologies">Cookies/Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>We use tracking technologies, such as cookies, local storage, and pixel tags.</p>
          <h3>Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
          <p>Cookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer. Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. “Cookies” and local storage are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer’s browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Many major Web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services. Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>
          <p>For more information, please read our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

          <h3>Pixel Tags</h3>
          <p>We also use “pixel tags,” which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the device that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.</p>

          <p>We use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites.</p>

          <h3>Log Files</h3>
          <p>A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. We collect log files and other usage information when you access, use and interact with the Services (even if you have not created an account or logged into your account on the Services), including IP address, date and time that you signed up for an account, language setting, browser type, operating system type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, page you requested, user agent, date and time stamps, clickstream data, and information about your search and click activity.</p>

          <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>
          <p>Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.</p>

          <h3>App Technologies, Customization, and Usage</h3>
          <p>There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your unique mobile device identifier (“UDID”) and other technical identifiers. More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.</p>

          <h3>Location-Identifying Technologies</h3>
          <p>GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</p>
          <p>In addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes essential to the operation of our sites and business.</p>
          <p>For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Service, please review Section 13 of this Privacy Notice and our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy</a>. You can also find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>.</p>

        <li>
          <h2 id="information-you-choose-to-submit">Information You Choose To Submit</h2>
          <p>You can visit the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “Personal Data”). If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the Services, you are required to provide certain Personal Data (for example, your name and email address), and you must also provide a username and password. We use your Personal Data to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our Services, to contact you from time to time about us and our products and services, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>We refer collectively to all information we collect that is not Personal Data, including Usage Data, demographic data and de-identified Personal Data, as “Non-Personal Data”. If we combine Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Personal Data, Non-Personal Data, and User Submissions are referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as “User Information.”</p>
          <p>You may choose to enter contests, sweepstakes, competitions, participate in surveys, subscribe to newsletters, comment articles, use message boards, chat rooms, reader photo upload areas, reader ratings and reviews, save articles or other content on our Services, reader-created content upload areas, contact us and customer support areas, and areas that allow you to register for SMS text messaging and mobile alerts, or otherwise interact with us in similar ways (“Interactive Areas”). These Interactive Areas may require that you provide Personal Data corresponding with the activities. You understand and agree that the Interactive Areas are voluntary and that your're providing Personal Data for those activities will be collected and used by us to identify and communicate with you. In certain circumstances, we may share that Personal Data with sponsors, advertisers, affiliates or other partners. When you take a quiz or survey or respond to a poll on the Services, in addition to recording your responses, we may record your IP address and/or other identifiers in order to provide an outcome (for quizzes), report and analyze your survey results, or record your vote as part of the final count (for polls). We may also use and disclose this information for advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>In addition, you are required to provide certain Personal Data when you submit a job application and supporting materials. You can also choose to submit or we may collect additional information about yourself, such as demographic information (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) and information about your preferences and interests. Failure to provide any required Personal Data will prevent us from being able to provide the Services you request (e.g., member registration or submission of job application) or otherwise inhibit our ability to provide the Services.</p>
          <p>Here are examples of User Information we may collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Data -</strong> your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.</li>
            <li><strong>Credentials -</strong> passwords, password hints, and other information for authentication and account access.</li>
            <li><strong>Demographic Data -</strong> demographic information including your age, gender, and country.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Data -</strong> data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument. With the exception of partial data such as the last four digits of your credit card, Payment Data will be collected directly by our third-party payment processors, and we will never collect, store, or otherwise process this information.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Data -</strong> your username, interests, favorites, and other profile data.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts -</strong> any contact information that you specifically choose to provide us in order to fulfill a request by you. For example, you may provide us with another person’s name and address in order to fulfill a gift subscription for that person. Such functionality is only intended for United States residents. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Content -</strong> the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support. We also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the services you use.</li>
            <li><strong>Resume Data -</strong> to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, including your employment history, writing samples, and references.</li>
            <li><strong>Survey Data -</strong> we may also survey visitors about various topics, including events and experiences, media consumption preferences and how we can improve our Services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Postings -</strong> information when you submit something to be displayed on our Services. Any communication you submit or that may be posted to a publicly viewable area of our Services, such as a comment on an article or a review, is a public communication and may be viewed by the general public. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to such areas via our Services, whether or not your submission includes Personal Data. These submissions would include newsletter sign-ups and any area of our Service that requires a login or registration prior to use. If at any time you display your Personal Data in any communication submitted to such areas, other individuals may collect and use your Personal Data. We are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any Personal Data you disclose in a communication submitted to such areas for posting or contained in an email or other communication submitted to us for such posting, and thus, you acknowledge that if you disclose Personal Data in any such material, you do so at your own risk.</li>

          <p>We may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we show you, and for other purposes. We may receive this information about you from public sources or third parties, including without limitation consumer data resellers, social networks, and advertisers.

If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you don’t want a social network to share it with us, please review the privacy policy, privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our Services.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2 id="our-information-sharing-practice">Our Information Sharing Practice</h2>
          <h3>Generally</h3>
          <p>We share Non-Personal Data with third parties in our discretion. Information collected via the Services is shared among our affiliates. For example, we may share your information with our related entities including our parent and sister companies for customer support, marketing, and technical operations. We share User Information, including Personal Data, as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, and under the following circumstances.</p>

          <h3>Service Providers</h3>
          <p>From time to time, we enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (for example, analytics and research companies, advertisers and ad agencies, data management and storage services, credit card processing services, merchandise sales facilitators, sweepstakes or contest prize fulfillment). We share your information with third parties for the purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Services) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Services and advertising effectiveness, and other enabling enhancements. We share aggregate information about our visitors with our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the Service(s) or page(s), or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information is not specific to any individual visitor. We obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal the precise location of a specific visitor. We also obtain other demographic information from third parties to improve our products and services, for marketing purposes or to display more relevant advertising. In those circumstances, we disclose User Information so that such service providers perform those services. These service providers are only permitted to use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. Our Services use certain Google analytics and other services, and certain pages use the Google AMP Client ID API, each of which enable collection and sharing of your information (including Personal Data) with Google for further use. For specific information on Google usage and how to control it, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services – Privacy & Terms – Google</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Privacy Policy – Privacy & Terms – Google</a>.</p>

          <h3>Operational Providers</h3>
          <p>For your convenience, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through the Services (including, without limitation, retail purchases, print and digital magazine subscriptions and special event tickets). Companies other than Vox Media, Inc., its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may process these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order and contest fulfillment and/or contract services “operational providers.” They are third parties that perform services on our behalf. If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your Personal Data to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your Personal Data to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the operational provider’s terms of use and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request from you, we may share your Personal Data with the provider. The operational provider may also share your Personal Data and information about your purchases with us.

          <h2 id="anonymous-data">Anonymous Data</h2>
          <p>When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third-party. We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. Anonymous data will include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies.

If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us will be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States.

          <h3>Generally</h3>
          <p>We use other companies under agreements with us to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services. These companies may collect and use clickstream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to the Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information. Other companies’ use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. In addition, we share with these third parties any Personal Data you voluntarily provide, such as an email address, in response to an advertisement or sponsored content link.</p>
          <h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
          <p>In order to serve offers and advertisements that may be of interest to our users, we display targeted advertisements on the Services, or other digital properties or applications in conjunction with our content, based on information provided to us by our users and information provided to us by third parties that they have independently collected.</p>
          <h3>Your Ad Choices</h3>
          <p>Some of the third-party services providers and/or Advertisers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). You can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You can opt-out of the use of your behavioral data used by DAA members to serve you interest-based advertising on third-party sites <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">here</a>.</p>
          <p>If you are accessing the Services through an application (i.e., mobile phone or tablet) you can download the AppChoices application from your device’s application store (i.e., Google Play, Apple App Store, and Amazon Store). This DAA application allows participating companies to offer an opt-out of customized advertisements that are based on predictions about your interests generated from your application usage. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online or on your device.</p>

          <h3>Mobile</h3>
          <p>We may from time to time offer certain location or pinpoint based services, such as location assisted navigation instruction. If you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide such location-based services to you. By using the location-based services, you authorize us to: (i) locate your hardware; (ii) record, compile and display your location; and (iii) publish your location to third parties designated by you by means of location publication controls available within the applications (for example, settings, user preferences). As part of the location-based services, we also collect and store certain information about the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device id. This information will be used to provide you the location-based services. We use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through mobile systems (unless you opt out of such location-based services with such providers) and we provide the information to such providers to enable them to provide their location-based services, provided that such providers use the information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

If you would like to update, correct, modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you previously submitted to us, please let us know by <a href="https://auth.voxmedia.com/login?community_id=554&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.voxmedia.com%2Flegal%2Fprivacy-notice">logging in</a> and updating your profile.

          <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
          <p>We have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure; unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. You use the Services and provide us with information at your own initiative and risk. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section below.</p>

          <h2 id="childrens-policy">Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>We especially care about the privacy of young children. Most of our Services, with the exception of certain child-directed services as described below, are intended for a general audience and are not intended for and should not be used by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 on our general audience services, and we do not target such services to children under the age of 16.</p>
          <p>Some of our Services are clearly identified as being marketed directly to children under the age of 16 (such as our Dodo Kids channel or other child-directed services). In connection with such child-directed services, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from users under the age of 16 without complying with applicable legal requirements and making appropriate disclosures. We are committed to compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. federal law designed to protect children online. We may collect and store persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses) from children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.</p>
          <p>For any of our Services, if a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us using the details in the <i><b>Contact Us</b></i> section below. We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

We will get your explicit consent for our collection, use, or sharing of this data where required by law. Otherwise, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data as this term is defined under applicable data protection and privacy laws on or through the Services or otherwise to us.</p>
          <p>If you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Data to us or the public through the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Data, you must not submit such content to our Services, and you must contact us to make us aware immediately.</p>

          <h2 id="california-residents-your-california-privacy-rights">Important Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
          <p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) refers to such information as “Personal Information.” If you are a California consumer, as defined by the CCPA, the CCPA provides you with specific rights regarding your Personal Information. This section describes the rights that California consumers have and explains how to exercise those rights. For the purposes of this section, Personal Information does not include: (i) information that is lawfully made available from federal, state or local government records; (ii) de-identified or aggregated data; or (iii) information excluded from the scope of the CCPA. To be clear, these rights are granted only to the extent that you are a California consumer. The rights in this section are not intended to grant you additional rights, but only your rights under the CCPA with respect to the applicable Personal Information.</p>

          <h3>Information We Collect; How We Collect It; How We Use It</h3>
          <p>Information about our data collection during the prior 12 months is described below. California consumers may access, delete, and control certain uses of their information as set forth in Rights to Your Information.</p>

          <h3>Sharing of Personal Information</h3>

          <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party for a business purpose or sell your Personal Information, subject to your right to opt out of those sales (see <strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out</strong> and <strong>Opt-In Rights</strong>, below). The information above under Information We Collect; How We Collect It; How We Use It describes the third parties with which we may share your Personal Information.</p>

          <h3>Right to Know and Delete</h3>
          <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to delete the personal information we have collected from you and the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding 12 months. In particular, you have the right to request the following from us:</p>

          <ol type="a">
            <h3><i><u>Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed or Sold</u></i></h3>

            <p>As a California consumer, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <strong>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</strong>, below), and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information. You have the right to request any or all of the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.</li>
              <li>The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected.</li>
              <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.</li>
              <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.</li>
              <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li><i>Deletion Request Rights</i></li>

            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <strong>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</strong>, below), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. However, we may retain Personal Information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to perform certain actions set forth under CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>

            <li><i>Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</i></li>

            <p>To exercise any of these rights, please <a href="/contact">submit a request through our online form</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com">vmprivacy@voxmedia.com</a>. Alternatively, you may contact us with the details of your request at the following toll-free phone number: 1-800-478-9140. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days.</p>

            <p>Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an “authorized agent”), may make the requests set forth above.</p>

            <p>We have a duty as the holder of certain personal information to verify your identity when making requests to know or delete personal information and to ensure that dissemination of that information would not cause harm to you if it were distributed to another person. To verify your identity, we will request and collect additional personal information from you to match it against our records. We may ask for additional information or documentation if we feel it is necessary to confirm your identity with the necessary degree of certainty. We may communicate with you through email, a secure message center, or other reasonably necessary and appropriate means. We do have the right to deny requests under certain circumstances. In such cases, we will notify you of the reasons for denial.</p>

            <li><i>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</i></li>

            <p>You have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is at least 16 and less than 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 16 years of age. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age.</p>

            <p>To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page: "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information." You may also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.</p>

            <p>You may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time by emailing us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.</p>

            <li><i>Non-Discrimination</i></li>

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including but not limited to, by:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Denying you goods or services.</li>
              <li>Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
              <li>Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
              <li>Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Financial Incentives</h3>
            <p>Financial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information about them.</p>
            <p>We may offer discounted prices to consumers who sign up to be on our mailing lists or join our loyalty programs. Such programs will have additional terms that require your review and agreement. Please review those terms for the details of those programs, how to withdraw or cancel, or to assert your rights specific to those programs.</p>
            <p>We generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under California law. However, in certain circumstances, discounted prices will require you to be on our mailing list or a member of our loyalty program. In such circumstances, we may offer a price difference because the price is reasonably related to the value of your data. The value of your data will be explained in the terms of such incentivized programs.</p>

            <h3>Shine the Light</h3>
            <p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt out of this type of sharing.</p>
            <p>To exercise a Shine the Light request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:vmprivacy@voxmedia.com">vmprivacy@voxmedia.com</a> or Vox Media, LLC c/o Legal Department , Vox Media, LLC, 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. Please note that we will not accept inquiries via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labelled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>

            <li><strong>Right to delete.</strong> You have the right to delete Personal Data that you have provided by or that we have obtained about you. Please note that we may deny such request if the requested deletion falls under an exception as set forth in the VCDPA.

            <li><strong>Right to opt out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the processing of the Personal Data for purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of Personal Data; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.

              <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>

          <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights; Verifying Your Identity</h3>

          <p>To exercise any of your Virginia privacy rights, or if you have any questions about your privacy rights, you may contact us by emailing us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.</p>
          <p>After submitting a request, we will take steps to verify your identity in order for us to properly respond and/or confirm that your request is not fraudulent. We may contact you for additional information as reasonably necessary to authenticate your request, but if we are ultimately unable to authenticate your request using reasonably commercial efforts, then we may not be able to comply with it.</p>
          <p>Only you may make a verifiable request related to your Personal Data. If you are making a request as the parent or legal guardian of a known child regarding the processing of that child’s Personal Data, we may ask you to submit reliable proof of your identity.</p>

          <h3>Response Time; Your Right to Appeal</h3>

          <p>We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, the VCDPA allows us up to 90 days to respond. We will contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to inform you of the need for additional time and the reason for such extension. We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs if your requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.</p>
          <p>If we decline to take action on a request that you have submitted, we will inform you of our reasons for doing so, and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision. You will have the right to appeal within a reasonable period of time after you have received our decision.

          <h3>Provision of personal data and failure to provide personal data:</h3>

          <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with our services). In this case, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>

          <h3>Collection of personal data from third-party sources:</h3>

          <p>We may obtain personal data and other information about you through public sources and/or our third-party partners who help us provide our products and services to you.</p>

          <h3>Withdrawing your consent:</h3>

          <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.</p>

          <h3>Data Transfer:</h3>

          <p>We may transfer personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK to the United States and other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission or the UK Secretary of State to have an adequate level of data protection. Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission and/or UK Secretary of State which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For more information about how we transfer your data, please contact us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com.</p>

          <h3>Use of your personal data for marketing purposes:</h3>

          <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Promotional offers from us: We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or used our services and, in each case, you have consented to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Subject Rights:</h3>

          <p>If you are situated in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, under the GDPR, as a data subject, you have the right to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
            <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To exercise your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com. Please note that in order for you to assert these rights, we may need to verify your identity to confirm your right to access your personal data. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In order to verify your identity, we may need to gather more personal data from you than we currently have. For more information about how to get access to Personal Data and for exercising your rights, you can submit a request <a href="/contact">here</a> by selecting the “I am an EU resident and would like to exercise my individual rights” option.</p>

          <p>If you have accepted our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, we will collect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy based on your affirmative informed consent, which you may withdraw at any time through the methods provided herein. If you have not accepted, then we only collect your personal data based on our legitimate interests.
