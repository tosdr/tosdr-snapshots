owners. You may not use our trade names, trademarks, service marks or
logos in connection with any product or service that is not ours, or in

trademarks, service marks or logos without the express prior written
consent of the owner.</p>

available access to information, products, services and other materials
made available by third parties (<span dir="rtl">“</span><u>Third Party

deemed to be a representation or warranty by Company with respect to any
Third Party Materials. We have no obligation to monitor Third Party
Materials, and we may block or disable access to any Third Party
Materials (in whole or part) through the Site at any time. In addition,
the availability of any Third Party Materials through the Site does not
imply our endorsement of, or our affiliation with, any provider of such
Third Party Materials, nor does such availability create any legal
relationship between you and any such provider.</p>

risk and is subject to any additional terms, conditions and policies
applicable to such Third Party Materials (such as terms of service or
