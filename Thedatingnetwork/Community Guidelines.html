                <h2>Acceptable Email Use Policy:</h2>
                <p class="bold">To comply with the US Federal Law and CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, TheDatingNetwork.com strictly enforces the following anti-spam policy.

Any e-mail campaigns must conform to our opt-in email policies and must be pre-approved by your affiliate manager. SENDING EMAIL CAMPAIGNS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL AND/OR SPAMMING WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOU WILL NOT BE PAID SO DO NOT SPAM! </p>
                <p class="bold">The United States Congress enacted the CAN-SPAM Act ('the Act').

Effective immediately all affiliates must comply with the act when promoting TheDatingNetwork.com affiliate program.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clear and conspicuous identification of the message as an "advertisement" or "solicitation." notice that the e-mail recipient may choose not to receive additional e-mails regarding the company's services and products.</li>
                    <li>A return e-mail address or other effective internet mechanism the e-mail recipient may use to notify you that it does not wish to receive additional e-mails regarding the company's products and services. Per the statute's requirement, the "opt-out" mechanism must be available for at least 30 days after the transmission of the original e-mail and you or any party working on your behalf must honor any such opt-out requests within 10 days of the request.</li>
                    <li>You may not sell or otherwise transfer to anyone else the e-mail addresses of those persons choosing not to receive additional e-mails.</li>
                    <li>A valid physical postal address of the company which is sending the email must be attached to every approved email.</li>
                    <li>E-mail messages containing sexually oriented material must include a warning label of such in the subject heading. You must also indicate that unless the recipient takes further action to view the sexually oriented material, the message initially viewable to the recipient when the e-mail is opened includes only the warning label and instructions on how to access, or a mechanism to access, the sexually oriented material.</li>

                <p>
