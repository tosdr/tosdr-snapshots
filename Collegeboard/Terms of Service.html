But if we can’t, then these rules will govern legal disputes between you and College Board involving College Board Services:</p><p>All disputes between you and College Board (each a “party”) that relate in any way to these Legal Terms or to College Board Services will exclusively be resolved in binding arbitration or small claims court. By agreeing to arbitration in accordance with this Section, you are waiving your right to have your dispute heard by a judge or jury except as set forth below.&nbsp;</p><p>Either party can seek to have a claim resolved in small claims court if the rules of that court will allow it. Additionally, if the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or College Board may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before an arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. &nbsp;Any dispute about whether a claim qualifies for small claims court will be resolved by that court and not by an arbitrator. &nbsp;In the event that either party elects to have their claims heard in small claims court, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until there is a decision by the small claims court that the claim should proceed in arbitration.</p><p>All claims that are not decided in small claims court must be resolved through binding, individual arbitration before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<em><strong>"AAA"</strong></em>) under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, supplemented by the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules as applicable, in effect at the time a request for arbitration is filed with the AAA. Copies of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules are located at&nbsp;<a href="http://adr.org/">adr.org</a>. The arbitrator will have the authority to resolve any dispute regarding the scope or enforceability of these Legal Terms, except only a court can decide claims that a party violated the intellectual property rights of the other party. In addition, only a court can decide issues relating to (a) the pre-arbitration requirements contained in these Legal Terms or (b) the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions contained in these Legal Terms.</p><p>Before commencing a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, that party (the “complainant”) must provide the other party (the “respondent”) with a written notice of dispute that includes the complainant’s name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, relevant documents, the specific relief sought, and the complainant’s physical signature (signature by counsel to the party is not sufficient). &nbsp;If you are the complainant, you must send the notice of dispute by first class mail, FedEx, or UPS to Legal Department, 250 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10281. &nbsp;College Board will send its notice to your address as reflected in College Board’s records.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, before the complainant may commence a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, the parties must attempt to resolve the dispute through informal, good-faith negotiation.&nbsp; If the parties have not resolved the dispute within sixty (60) days of the respondent’s receipt of the written notice of dispute, the parties will mutually schedule a settlement conference which must occur within fourteen (14) days of the completion of the sixty (60) day period, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.&nbsp; Each party must personally appear at the settlement conference (if a party is represented by counsel, their counsel may also participate), and appearances may be made telephonically or by video.&nbsp; If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute at the settlement conference, either party may commence arbitration or file a small claims court proceeding. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.&nbsp; If any aspect of the requirements in this Section have not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or the assessment of any arbitration fees.&nbsp; In addition, unless prohibited by law, the AAA cannot accept or administer the arbitration, nor assess any fees for an arbitration that has not met the requirements of this Section. &nbsp;If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.</p><p>If the dispute proceeds to arbitration, the complainant must personally attend all arbitration conferences, hearings, and mediations scheduled by the AAA or by an arbitrator or mediator appointed by the AAA.&nbsp; If the complainant is represented by counsel, complainant’s counsel may also participate, and all participation may be made telephonically or by video except as directed by the arbitrator or mediator. &nbsp;&nbsp;If a complainant fails to personally appear at any conference, hearing or mediation scheduled by the AAA or by a AAA arbitrator or mediator, regardless of whether the complainant’s counsel attends, the arbitrator will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless the complainant shows good cause as to why the complainant was not able to attend the conference, hearing, or mediation.</p><p>This arbitration will be conducted as a documents-only arbitration (i.e., there will be no in-person or telephonic hearing) unless otherwise agreed by the parties or required by the arbitrator. &nbsp;If the parties agree to or the arbitrator requires proceedings, such proceedings should be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the parties agree that the proceedings will be conducted via a video or telephonic call or, in the event that face-to-face proceedings are agreed to by the parties or required by the arbitrator, at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator may consider rulings in arbitrations involving other individuals, but an arbitrator's rulings will not be binding in proceedings involving different individuals. The existence and content of the arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, any correspondence from the AAA, and correspondence, orders, and awards issued by the arbitrator, will remain strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party, unless disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the arbitration proceedings or related court proceedings.</p><p>For disputes meeting the definition of “Mass Arbitration” under the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, the parties agree that the dispute is subject to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and the parties agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator, except as may otherwise be decided by the arbitrator or the AAA.</p><p>The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (<em><strong>"FAA"</strong></em>) 9 U.S.C. § 1&nbsp;<em>et seq.</em>&nbsp;governs this Section, and it is the intent of the parties that the FAA will preempt all State laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p><p>No arbitration may be maintained as a class or collective action; a party may bring a claim only on their own behalf and cannot seek a relief that would affect other individuals. Unless all parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not have the authority to consolidate the claims of more than 1 individual, conduct any class or collective proceeding, make any class or collective award, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration, without the express written consent of College Board.</p><p>Payment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules. &nbsp;If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then College Board may seek applicable fee-shifting.<br>&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>GOVERNING LAW, VENUE AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</strong><br>These Legal Terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to choice or conflict of law principles.

You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes to these Legal Terms.
