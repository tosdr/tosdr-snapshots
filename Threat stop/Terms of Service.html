The receiving party shall protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it regularly uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party shall use the Confidential Information only for the limited purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not be provided or disclosed to anyone except those employees or contractors of the receiving party with a need to know in connection with the exercise of the receiving party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement who agree to be bound by these terms.&nbsp; Confidential Information and any and all authorized copies thereof shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed or returned if requested by the disclosing party.&nbsp;</p>
