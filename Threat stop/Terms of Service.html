<p><strong>9. CONFIDENTIALITY</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>“Confidential Information” includes, without limitation, the Documentation, Licensed Software, ThreatSTOP Service and results of ThreatSTOP Service comparative performance benchmarks, passwords provided to Customer for ThreatSTOP Service access, Customer Data, information related to past, present or future research, development or business affairs, any proprietary products, materials or methodologies, and any other information that which by its nature is normally and reasonably considered confidential or provides the disclosing party with a competitive advantage.&nbsp; Confidential Information other than that described in the preceding sentence, shall be marked as confidential or proprietary or, if disclosed verbally, shall be identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure. The receiving party shall protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it regularly uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party shall use the Confidential Information only for the limited purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not be provided or disclosed to anyone except those employees or contractors of the receiving party with a need to know in connection with the exercise of the receiving party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement who agree to be bound by these terms.&nbsp; Confidential Information and any and all authorized copies thereof shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed or returned if requested by the disclosing party.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9.3</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of ThreatSTOP’s Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law to compensate ThreatSTOP for the breach of this Section 9 or of Sections&nbsp;2, 3, or 4; that any such breach will allow Customer or third parties to compete unfairly with ThreatSTOP resulting in irreparable harm to ThreatSTOP that would be difficult to measure; and, therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, ThreatSTOP shall be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief (without the necessity of proving actual damages or of posting a bond), in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law, hereunder, or otherwise.</p>
