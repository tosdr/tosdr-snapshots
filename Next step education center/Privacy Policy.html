<p class=MsoNormal>We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to
identify your computer and browser) and other automated tools such as tracking
pixels to improve the experience of the site and Services, such as saving your
preferences from visit to visit to present you with a customized version of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'>We use the following types of
cookies:</p>
<ul>

<li><i>Session Cookies</i>: Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from page to page within the Site and are typically
deleted once you close your browser. For example, session cookies allow your online credit application to function properly.</li>

<li><i>Analytics Cookies</i><b>: </b>Analytics cookies help us understand how our Site is working and who is visiting our Site. Google

<p class=MsoNormal>We employ software technology that enables us to track
certain aspects of a user's visit to the Site. This technology helps us better
manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective, how
consumers engage with the Site, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from
the Site. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1)
"tracking pixels" and (2) "clear gifs." Tracking pixels are pieces of
executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity
including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages
are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are
embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has
viewed a particular web page or email message. User activity information may be
associated with additional information about a user's session and Personal
Information, if provided by the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another
website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other
website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may
be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the Privacy Policy of
any website from which you reached the Site to determine what information was
collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could
use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by
other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal
Information.</p>
