You hereby waive any moral rights or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship regarding Materials that you may have under applicable law.

We reserve all rights and remedies against any Copilot Users who breach these representations and warranties.</p><p>5. <strong>Payment Terms and Order Processing.</strong></p><p>A. <strong><em>Fees</em></strong>. Access to the Service, or certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees on a subscription basis, and may provide you the option to activate recurring automatic payments for those fees. Before you pay any fees, including before activating or updating any recurring payments, you will have an opportunity to review the fees that you will be charged before you accept them. If you purchase a recurring subscription, you authorize Copilot or its third-party service providers to periodically charge you for an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annual) (each a “Subscription Period”) until cancelled. You will be charged your first subscription fee and any applicable taxes (“Subscription Fee”) on the date you purchase your subscription or after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue at the selected interval, and you will continue to be charged at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), unless at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your subscription (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your subscription; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law.</p><p>If any Subscription Fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the Service or cancel your subscription. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts. We may receive updated credit card information (new credit card number or updated expiration date) from your credit card issuer. We may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Services. If you would like to use a different payment method or if there is a change in payment method, please visit the settings area of your account or app store to update your billing information.</p><p>By using our Service, you agree to the pricing, payment, and billing policies in effect at the time when the fee becomes payable. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p><p>B. <strong><em>Authorization to Charge for the Service</em></strong>. You must provide accurate and complete information for a valid payment method that you are authorized to use (such as a credit card, payment via an app store, or other payment method accepted by us to activate and maintain a paid account). You authorize us to charge you through the payment method that you use when you register for access to the Service. You are also responsible for charges for any additional features or purchases made through your account that are offered for sale through our Service. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Copilot (or its third-party service providers) may change the fees for the Service or any feature of the Service.</p><p>If we do not receive payment via your payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. If the payment method you provide is initially declined for any reason, we reserve the right to charge the payment method (credit card or other accepted mechanism) in installments, at the non-promotional/non-discounted rate that is in place at the time, for the full duration of the subscription that you have selected. You bear sole responsibility for all overdraft fees or other penalties that may be assessed by your payment provider. You are responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument.</p><p>C. <strong><em>Apple Subscription Management</em></strong>. If you purchased your subscription through the Apple App Store, your subscription is managed by the Apple App Store directly. Copilot does not have the ability to manage your subscription on your behalf, including initiating, canceling, or refunding your subscriptions. You may manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to the Account Settings screen in the App Store app on your Apple device after purchase. You should consult with the Apple App Store to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.</p><p>D. <strong><em>Cancellation</em></strong>. When you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Subscription Period. In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current Subscription Period. If you purchased through Copilot directly, you may cancel within your account settings. Alternatively, if you email us at support@copilot.money at least 24 hours before the end of your current Subscription Period, we will do our best to implement the cancellation prior to your next renewal; if we cannot, we can offer you a refund for that inadvertent renewal. If you purchased through a third party (e.g., app store), you must cancel through that third party. Purchases through third parties are subject to that third party’s cancellation policies and procedures.</p><p>After canceling a subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service for the remainder of your current Subscription Period for which you have already paid (unless we provide you with a refund or otherwise allow you to use the unused portion towards another service, product, or subscription).</p><p>E. <strong>Limited Refund Period</strong>. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE. If you (i) purchased through Copilot directly, (ii) cancel your subscription within one month of your initial purchase, and (iii) email us at support@copilot.money to request a refund within five days of cancelling, we will provide you with a full refund for that subscription. Unless required by applicable law, if you cancel your subscription outside of that period, you are not entitled to receive any refund or credit, full or partial. We reserve the right to issue refunds, credits, or discounts at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund, credit, or discount, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. If you purchased through a third party, your ability to receive a refund is governed by that third party’s policies and procedures.</p><p>F. <strong>Free Trial and Promotional Rates</strong>. Copilot may offer promotional trial periods during which you can use the Service for free or at a promotional rate. Such trial or promotional trial periods are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer, including which users are eligible for the promotional subscription. Eligibility is initially determined at the time of the order. Free trial and promotional rates cannot be applied retroactively.</p><p>If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Copilot in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Copilot agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the expiration or termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COPILOT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND COPILOT UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO SECTION 14.I (OPT OUT).</p><p>Whether to agree to arbitration is an important business decision. It is your decision to make, and you should not rely solely on the information provided in these Terms as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take further steps to conduct research and to consult with others, including an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any other important business or life decision.</p><p>B. <strong><em>Exceptions</em></strong>. Despite the provisions of Section 14.A (Generally), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (1) bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) bring an action in a court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.; (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (4) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p>C. <strong><em>Arbitrator</em></strong>. Any arbitration between you and Copilot will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Copilot. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p><p>D. <strong><em>Notice; Process</em></strong>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail within the applicable statute of limitations period (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). Copilot’s address for Notice is: 45 Tudor City Place, Apt 1118, New York, NY 10017. The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Copilot may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Copilot must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Copilot will pay you the highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b) the last written settlement amount offered by Copilot in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (c) $1,000.</p><p>E. <strong><em>Fees</em></strong>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Copilot will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Wilmington, Delaware, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Copilot for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p><p>F. <strong><em>No Class Actions</em></strong>. YOU AND COPILOT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE § 2698 ET SEQ. WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 14 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)). Unless both you and Copilot agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p>G. <strong><em>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</em></strong>. If Copilot makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Copilot’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Copilot’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Copilot. If you do not send such written notice, your continued use of the Service following any such change means that you have consented to such change.</p><p>H. <strong><em>Enforceability</em></strong>. If Section 14.F (No Class Actions) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) will be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 (Governing Law; Choice of Forum) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.</p><p>I. <strong><em>Opt Out</em></strong>. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution), you may opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) by notifying Copilot in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days of the date you receive these Terms, an electronic message to support@copilot.money, stating clearly your full name and intent to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). Should you choose not to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) within the 30-day period, you and Copilot will be bound by the terms of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). You understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).</p><p>15. <strong>Cooperation with Authorities</strong>. Copilot may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. Except as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy, Copilot may disclose any information as Copilot deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Copilot’s sole discretion.</p><p>16. <strong>Protected Activity Not Prohibited</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing in these Terms will in any way limit or prohibit you from filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or participating in, any investigation or proceeding (“<strong>Protected Activity</strong>”) that may be conducted by any federal, state, or local government agency or commission (“<strong>Government Agencies</strong>”). In connection with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to disclose documents or other information as permitted by law, and without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, Copilot. In making any such disclosures or communications, you agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Copilot confidential information to any parties other than the Government Agencies.</p><p>17. <strong>Governing Law; Choice of Forum</strong>. The laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service. Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws; provided, however, that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any provision of these Terms. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.</p><p>18. <strong>Feedback</strong>. If you provide any feedback to Copilot concerning the functionality and performance of the Service (including identifying potential errors and improvements), you hereby assign to Copilot all right, title, and interest in and to such feedback, and Copilot is free to use such feedback without payment or restriction.</p><p>19. <strong>Entire Agreement; Variation</strong>. These Terms and the Privacy Policy set forth the entire agreement between Copilot and you with respect to the Service. These Terms supersede and govern all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these Terms. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter these Terms.</p><p>20. <strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provisions will be modified, or if not possible, severed, to reflect the fullest valid, legal, and enforceable expression of the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms will not be affected thereby.</p><p>21. <strong>Relationship of Parties</strong>. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to create an employer-employee relationship between Copilot and you, nor any agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship between the parties. Neither party will have the right to bind the other to any obligation, nor have the right to incur any liability on behalf of the other.</p><p>22. <strong>Waiver</strong>. No delay, omission, or failure to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms will be deemed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence to the event giving rise to such right or remedy, or a waiver of or acquiescence to any other right, remedy, or event.</p><p>23. <strong>Assignment</strong>. Neither these Terms nor any of the rights granted to you herein may be assigned or transferred by you, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the express prior written permission of Copilot and any attempt to do so will be null and void. Copilot may assign or transfer these Terms at any time without your permission.</p><p>24. <strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries</strong>. The provisions of these Terms relating to the rights of Copilot service providers are intended for the benefit of such service providers, and such service providers, as third-party beneficiaries, will be entitled to enforce such provisions in accordance with these Terms, irrespective of the fact that they are not parties to these Terms.</p><p>25. <strong>Export Controls</strong>. You hereby represent and warrant that: (A) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (B) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p><p>26. <strong>Interpretation</strong>. If Copilot provides a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English version will prevail. Any heading, caption, or section title contained in these Terms is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. Any use of the term “including” or variations thereof in this Agreement shall be construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.”</p><p>27. <strong>NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA USERS</strong>.
