<p>We reserve the right to unilaterally make changes to the suite of services we provide and add and/or remove any capabilities. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>LICENSE GRANT</strong>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the length of the term set forth in the applicable Order, MarTech Solutions LLC grants Customer, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, worldwide, limited right to access and use the Service (which may be modified, revised and updated in accordance with this Agreement) for collecting and analyzing web data on Customer's site(s), for Customer's own internal business purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMER DATA</strong>
<p>We assume that all data that is provided by the Customer was taken with the consent. Customer agrees that it will not provide any Sensitive Data to the Service. If Customer discovers that due to human error or otherwise, Customer Data does include Sensitive Data, Customer will promptly notify MarTech Solutions LLC and provide sufficient information to the Service to locate such Sensitive Data and MarTech Solutions LLC will scrub its systems, and the Sensitive Data in its control or possession. As between Customer and MarTech Solutions LLC, Customer owns all Customer Data and except as specifically provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing between the parties, MarTech Solutions LLC has no right to such Customer Data. Customer grants to MarTech Solutions LLC a non-exclusive royalty-free license to access Customer Data in order to provide the Services to Customer and as necessary to monitor and improve the Services. MarTech Solutions LLC will not (a) disclose Customer Data except as compelled by law or as expressly permitted in writing by you, or (b) access Customer Data except to provide the Services or prevent or address service or technical problems, or at your request in connection with customer support matters. For the avoidance of doubt, MarTech Solutions LLC may use, reproduce, and disclose Customer Data that is anonymized, de-identified, or is otherwise not reasonably associated or linked to Customer for product improvement. Customer, not MarTech Solutions LLC, will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
<p><strong>Confidential Information.</strong></p>
<p>Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has business, technical or financial information relating to Disclosing Party's business which it has disclosed or may disclose during this Agreement (“Confidential Information”). MarTech Solutions LLC's Confidential Information includes non-public information regarding features, functionality and performance of the Services, as well as all user visible aspects of the Services. Customer's Confidential Information includes information provided by Customer to the Service to enable the provision of the Services as well as all Customer Data. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all pricing and related metrics, are each party's Confidential Information.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Use.</strong></p>
<p>Receiving Party agrees that it will take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Receiving Party will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most important confidential information. Receiving Party agrees (i) not to use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any purpose except to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement and (ii) not to disclose any Confidential Information of Receiving Party to third parties or to such party's employees, officers, agents, contractors or other representatives (“Personnel”), except to those Personnel of Receiving Party who need or have access to such Confidential Information in order to perform works in connection with this Agreement and are subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with those of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong></p>
<p>Disclosing Party agrees that these confidentiality obligations will not apply to any information that Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from Disclosing Party; (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party; and/or (d) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Section precludes either party from disclosing the other party's Confidential Information as required by law or a legal process, provided that such party (a) gives the other party prior written notice sufficient to permit the other party to contest the disclosure or seek a protective order (or other confidential treatment) and (b) reasonably cooperates with the other party in limiting the disclosure. In addition, a party may disclose information concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including providing a copy of this Agreement, to any or all of the following: (a) potential acquirers, merger partners, investors and their personnel, attorneys, auditors and investment bankers, solely in connection with the due diligence review of such party by persons and provided that the disclosures are made in confidence, (b) the party's outside accounting firm, or (c) the party's outside legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>Return of Confidential Information.</strong></p>
<p>Promptly following the earlier of (i) the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, or (ii) the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party will return to Disclosing Party, or destroy all Confidential Information that are in written, electronic or other tangible form (including, without limitation, all written or printed documents, notes, memoranda, email, or computer memory, whether or not prepared by Receiving Party) to the extent containing or summarizing any portion of the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts of such Confidential Information. In addition, upon the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party will certify to Disclosing Party in writing Receiving Party's and its Personnel's compliance with its obligations pursuant to this Section.</p>
<p><strong>Redundancy.</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, MarTech Solutions LLC may retain Confidential Information after termination of this Agreement for such period of time agreed to by Customer and MarTech Solutions LLC. To the extent that MarTech Solutions LLC is required by law to maintain copies of Confidential Information, Customer Data, or records related to disclosure or handling of Confidential Information, MarTech Solutions LLC will be under no obligation to destroy such information. Furthermore, MarTech Solutions LLC will be permitted to retain such information, as MarTech Solutions LLC reasonably determines necessary to demonstrate to Customer or any regulatory authority, MarTech Solutions LLC's compliance with this Agreement or any applicable law or regulation. At such time as MarTech Solutions LLC's basis for retaining such information ceases to exist, MarTech Solutions LLC will destroy such information as set forth above.</p>

<p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
<p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.</p>
<p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>ACCOUNTS</strong>
<p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>PAYMENT OF FEES</strong>
<p><strong>Fees.</strong></p>
<p> The Services are offered on a subscription basis and payments can be made via credit card or via Paypal.</p>
<p>The final payment amount for the subscription will be displayed on the Order page.</p>
<p>We will bill your credit card at the time and according to the rates and terms which are incorporated into the Order.</p>
<p>Customer may separately subscribe for separately priced modules, as and when released by MarTech Solutions LLC. Customer must provide MarTech Solutions LLC with valid credit card information as a condition to signing up for the Services.</p>
<p>Customer agrees that MarTech Solutions LLC may charge the credit card the fee for the entire Subscription Term unless otherwise agreed to in an Order.</p>
<p>When you subscribe to any of our services, you will be billed in advance and your subscription will be automatically renewed, unless you cancel your subscription before the current billing cycle ends.</p>
<p>MarTech Solutions LLC will send notice to you if payment fails for any reason and you agree that you will immediately submit accurate credit card information for processing. It is your responsibility to make sure payment details are correct to prevent Service interruption and to allow successful renewal payments.</p>
<p> If Customer believes that MarTech Solutions LLC has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact MarTech Solutions LLC no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6a190b060f192a0d0b090504040f091e051844090507">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>All Fee changes will be made prospectively and any Services that have been pre-purchased will not be affected by the change in Fees. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties or as set forth on an Order, all Fees for any renewal periods will be based upon MarTech Solutions LLC then-prevailing rate. MarTech Solutions LLC may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by MarTech Solutions LLC within 30 days after the mailing date of the invoice (unless otherwise specified on the Order).</p>
<p>Taxes.</p>
<p>The Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases under this Agreement and any Order.</p>
<p>Suspension of Service and Acceleration.</p>
<p>If any amount owing by Customer under this or any other Agreement with MarTech Solutions LLC is ten (10) or more days overdue, MarTech Solutions LLC may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer's unpaid fee obligations under such Order so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend any and all services until such amounts are paid in full. If Customer or MarTech Solutions LLC initiates termination of this Agreement, Customer will be obligated to pay the balance due on Customer's account. Any use of the Services in violation of the Agreement by Customer that in MarTech Solutions LLC's reasonable judgment threatens the security, integrity or availability of MarTech Solutions LLC's services or that of its other customers, may result in MarTech Solutions LLC's immediately suspending the Services.</p>
<p>No Refunds. The Subscription Term will end on the expiration date and the subscription cannot be cancelled early. We do not provide refunds if you decide to stop using the MarTech Solutions LLC subscription during your Subscription Term.</p>
<p>All payments for your subscriptions shall become due immediately upon you subscribing to the relevant services.</p>
<p>Unless we specify to the contrary, prices displayed are in $(USD).</p>
<p>Subscription amount to be paid by the customer shall not be subject to any currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to unilaterally change the subscription prices. Any changes to the subscription prices shall become effective upon notice to our customers via email.</p>
