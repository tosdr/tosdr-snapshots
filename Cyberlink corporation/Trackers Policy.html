                                CyberLink allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks like Google, to display and/or serve
                                advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to
                                your browser the advertisements and links that appear on the website. They automatically receive your IP address
                                when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, or JavaScript) to measure the
                                effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the content you see. However, please note that if an
                                advertiser requires CyberLink to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 28 - 40) or
                                audience segment (for example, women in California who viewed certain content) and you respond to that
                                advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience they are
                                trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Website, Mobile App and Computer
                                Software, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to
                                determine which ads to deliver to you. The information will be recorded and anonymized by the Third Party
                                Advertisers by means of a series of non-reversible encoding functions. Where we provide you with interest-based ads
