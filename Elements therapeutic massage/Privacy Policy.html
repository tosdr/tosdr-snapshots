<p><u>For Other Purposes</u>. We may also share your Personal Information for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent.</p>

<p><strong><u>SECTION 4 &ndash; YOUR CHOICES</u></strong></p>

<p>In this section, we describe the rights and choices available to all users.</p>

<p><u>Opt Out Of Marketing Communications</u>. If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us, you may opt out by clicking the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; option in the email message, informing us at privacy@wellbizbrands.com, or mailing us at: Legal Dept / 1890 Wynkoop St., Unit 1, Denver CO 80202, call (866) 969-5666. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails</p>

Message and data rates may apply, check with your cellular or data carrier for information. Appointment confirmations and reminders will be based on the number of appointments you make. Consent to receive text messages is not required/not a condition for purchase of products or services. You can opt out of receiving text messages. To stop receiving text messages, reply STOP to any text message you receive.</p>

<p><u>Choosing Not To Share Your Personal Information</u>. Subject to certain exceptions (e.g., the Personal Information is necessary to provide the services or product, or where we must use your Personal Information to perform a legal obligation), you can choose not to share your Personal Information with us. If you do not provide this Personal Information when requested, it may restrict us or our Affiliated Brands&rsquo; franchised locations&rsquo; ability to provide a particular service or product. If so, we will explain the situation to assist you in making the decision by telling you what information you must provide to receive the services by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.</p>

<p><u>Cookies &amp; Browser Web Storage</u>. We may allow service providers and other third parties to use cookies and similar technologies to track your browsing activity over time and across the WB Sites and third-party websites. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the WB Sites may not work properly. Similarly, your browser settings may allow you to clear your browser web storage.</p>

<p><u>Location Data</u>. Users of our mobile application also have the choice whether to allow us to access your precise location data. Your device settings may provide the ability for you to revoke our ability to access location data. Most web browsers also have the choice to allow us to access your precise location data. To disable this feature, please check your browser settings.</p>

<p><u>Advertising Choices</u>. Some of the business partners that collect information about users&rsquo; activities on or through the WB Sites may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.</p>

<p>Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here </a>or the <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here</a>. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.</p>

<p>In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit our, or our partners&rsquo;, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.</p>

<p>If you choose to opt out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.</p>

<p><u>Do Not Track</u>. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; or similar signals. To find out more about &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</a></p>

<p><strong><u>SECTION 5 &ndash; SECURITY</u></strong></p>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Information we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information.</p>

<p><strong><u>SECTION 6 &ndash; OTHER SITES, MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES</u></strong></p>

<p>The WB Sites may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites, mobile applications and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.</p>

<p><strong><u>SECTION 7 &ndash; CHILDREN</u></strong></p>

<p>The WB Sites are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age, and we do not intentionally collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 without the consent of the child&rsquo;s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.</p>

<p><strong><u>SECTION 8 &ndash; CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</u></strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by posting the new Privacy Policy on the WB Sites and changing the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date above. If required by law, we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail or another manner through the WB Sties. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the WB Sites after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
