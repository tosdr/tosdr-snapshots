<h2><a name="_Toc17163249">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class=term-text>Welcome! Thank you for your interest in www.MyAnimeList.net and the MyAnimeList online manga store,
  and any other MyAnimeList branded websites, online stores, services, subscriptions, offerings, games and applications, and other
  applications and online services (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”, which also include the MAL Online Manga
  Store as defined below in Section 18) owned, operated or controlled by MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. (formerly MyAnimeList, LLC)
  (“MyAnimeList”, “MAL”, “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company”)  that link to these Terms of Use. Please read this Terms of Use Agreement document (“Agreement”
  or “Terms of Use”) carefully because it is legally binding and governs your access to and use of our Service,
  including any Company Content and User Content (defined below). This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, Members
  (referenced below), moderators, and others who access or use the Services (“User” or "Users"). All references to “you”
  or “your,” as applicable, mean the User or other person or entity who accesses or uses the Services in any manner.</p>

<p class=term-text>By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound
  by these Terms of Use, MyAnimeList's <a class="ga-click" data-ga-click-type="membership-payment-link-privacy_policy" href="/about/privacy_policy">Privacy
    Policy</a>, and any additional terms and conditions (including, for example, terms and conditions that may be included in MAL Frequently Asked Questions or “FAQ” posts), notices and disclaimers displayed through the Service, whether
  or not you are a registered user of the Service. You agree that by clicking “Sign Up”, “Join” or other similar
  registration links or buttons or by accessing or using the Service, <b>you are agreeing to enter into a legally
    binding contract with the Company</b>. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, MyAnimeList's <a class="ga-click" data-ga-click-type="membership-payment-link-privacy_policy"
    href="/about/privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>, or any other terms and conditions, notices or disclaimers displayed

  our Services. </p>

<h2 class="term-header2"><a name="_Toc17163250">1. Amendments to these Terms of Use</a></h2>

<p class=term-text>These Terms of Use may be amended by us from time to time and we reserve the right to do so at any
  time. When we amend these Terms of Use, we will provide notice to you. We may provide you notice of amended Terms of
  Use by sending an email to the email address associated with your MyAnimeList user account (if you have chosen to
  provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Service. Any amendments to the Terms of Use
  will be posted here and the date indicated on the top of the Terms of Use will state the date the Terms of Use were
  last revised. Continued use of the Service after any amendments to the Terms of Use and after we have provided you
  notice of the amended Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the
  Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Services and should therefore immediately cease any use of the Services.
</p>

<h2 class="term-header2"><a name="_Toc17163251">2. Eligibility</a></h2>

<p class=term-text>You represent that you are over the age of majority as required by the applicable law of your
  jurisdiction. If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (e.g. under 18 years of age), you may only
  use the Service if (a) you obtain parental or legal guardian consent after review of this Agreement prior to you using
  any of the Service provided by Company and (b) you are competent and fully able to enter into the representations, and
  warranties, terms, conditions, obligations, and affirmations, set forth in this Agreement, and to comply with and
  abide by this Agreement. All minors must be directly supervised by their parent or guardian while using our chat
  rooms. Though Company has the right to monitor the Service, including the chat rooms, Company has no obligation to do
  so, and Company does not systematically monitor and review the conversations that take place in the chat rooms.
  Company does not determine the true identity or age of those who frequent and use the Service chat rooms.</p>

<p class=term-text>Additionally, children under age 13 in the U.S. and children under age 16 in Europe may only use the
  Service if, and only if, we have obtained verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian, as discussed in
  our Privacy Policy. The Company may in its sole discretion for any or no reason, with or without notice, including
  without limitation if it has not received verifiable parental consent and it believes that you are under 13 in the
  U.S. or under 16 in Europe, terminate your account or profile, delete any content or information that you have posted
  on the Service, and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Service (or any portion, aspect or feature of the
  Service).</p>

<p class=term-text>If you do not agree or are not in compliance with these Terms of Use, you may not use our Service.
</p>

<h2 class="term-header2"><a name="_Toc17163252">3. Limitation of Liability</a></h2>

<p class=term-text>IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS
  AFFILIATES, OR ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS,
  EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
  CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING
  DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING OUT, IN CONNECTION WITH OF OR
  RESULTING THESE TERMS OF USE OR FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE, EVEN IF THE
  COMPANY IS AWARE OF OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE COMPANY'S
  AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
  THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT NO GREATER THAN THE
  AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES, DIGITAL CONTENT (DEFINED BELOW) OR ANY RELATED
  PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS AND
  LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES AS SET FORTH ABOVE, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS
  AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY TO
  YOU WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE
  LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SET FORTH HEREIN WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF
  ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVICE.</p>

<p class=term-text>Without limiting the foregoing, and to the
  extent allowed by applicable law, Company assumes no liability or
  responsibility, including but not limited to, for any of the following:</p>

<ul class="ul-list list-style">
  <li>Any interruption or cessation
    of transmission to or from the Service;
  </li>
  <li>Errors, mistakes, or
    inaccuracies of content;
  </li>
  <li>Any unauthorized access to or
    use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored
    therein;
  </li>
  <li>User content or the
    defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
  </li>
  <li>Any bugs, viruses, trojan
    horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Service by
    any third party;
  </li>
  <li>Personal injury or property
    damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of
    our Service;
  </li>
  <li>Any errors or omissions in any
    content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any
    content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through
    the Service; and/or
  </li>
  <li>Any damages of any kind
    suffered by you or claimed to have been suffered by you arising out of or
    as a result of your use of any third party websites, applications or other
    services that may link to, be linked to from, access or integrate with our
    Services.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class=term-text>The foregoing limitation of liability shall
  apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.
  This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is
  based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even
  if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damage. </p>

<p class=term-text>The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in Japan, and we may process some data in the United States. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with local law, including but not limited to export and import regulations, to the extent permitted by law. You represent that you are not (1) located in a country that is subject to a Japan or U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the Japan or U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and (2) listed on any Japan or U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. Without limiting the foregoing, software available in connection with the Service may be subject to applicable export controls. No feature, function, software or any component thereof may be downloaded from the Service or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of any applicable export laws. Downloading or using any software is at your sole risk. You further agree not to upload to the Service any data or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization.</p>

<h2 class="term-header2"><a name="_Toc17163253">4. Use of the Service</a></h2>

<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(A) License and Registration:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>Company grants you a limited,
  non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sub-licensable, revocable, license to use
  the Service solely for your personal, noncommercial use, and as set forth in
  this Agreement, provided that (a) you will not alter or modify any part of the
  Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its
  intended purpose, (b) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of
  the Service in any medium, and (c) you will otherwise comply with the terms and
  conditions of this Agreement. Company may revoke this license at any time, and in
  its sole discretion. Upon such revocation, you must promptly destroy all
  materials downloaded or otherwise obtained from the Service, as well as all
  copies of such materials, whether made in accordance with these Terms of Use or
  otherwise.</p>

<p class=term-text>No registration is required to use the
  Service. However, in order to access certain features of the Service,
  registration with Company will be required and you will need to create a
  &quot;Member&quot; account or other user account or profile. Your account or
  profile gives you access to the services and functionality that we may
  establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.</p>

<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(B) Paid Premium Features:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>Company may offer a paid subscription
  service where Users may use the Service with Premium Features, including, for
  example (i) where Members will not see ads hosted by the Service while logged
  into their accounts, and (ii) receive special discounts for purchases of goods
  and services from the Service, affiliates and third party partners (“Premium Features”). </p>
  
<p class=term-text>Company may also offer one-time purchases for access to Premium Features for a fixed period of time, and may also offer related services such as the ability for users to purchase
  access to Premium Features for other users (for example, in the form of a gift that can be given to and claimed by another user). Such one-time purchases will expire (if not claimed or used) after 5 months or after such other period of time as may be set forth by Company on the applicable page for such purchases . All payments for such one-time purchases are non-refundable, regardless of whether or not it was used. </p>

<p class=term-text>MyAnimeList may change the fees or benefits associated with the Premium Features from time
  to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance
  notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary
  reductions in the fees associated with the Premium Features.</p>

<p class=term-text>You may submit your debit card, credit
  card, or other payment information (&quot;Payment Information&quot;) via our
  Service to purchase Premium Features or other paid products or services. We use
  third-party service providers to process your Payment Information. If you
  submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and
  you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that
  includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees. By signing up for
  Premium Features or other paid products or services, you are providing us with
  your payment account information, you agree to pay the then-current applicable fee listed in the applicable terms and conditions or other agreement and, if applicable, you are signing up to an auto-renewing
  subscription requiring recurring payments.</p>

<p class=term-text>If you sign up for a monthly or annual subscription
  service, you will be charged your first monthly or annual subscription fee and any
  applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your
  subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends. Your
  subscription will automatically continue on a monthly or annual basis, as applicable, and you will
  continue to be charged on such monthly or annual basis at the then-current price (including
  any applicable taxes), until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
  You can find your monthly and/or annual subscription billing date
  in your account settings.</p>

<p class=term-text>If your subscription includes a free trial,
  you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain
  the free trial you will be required to provide a credit card in order to ensure
  uninterrupted access to the Premium Features and services and continued use
  after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial,
  your subscription will automatically convert into a paid monthly (or annual, if applicable) subscription
  and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have
  cancelled that subscription. You may cancel your monthly or annual subscription as
  described below. You agree that your payment method may be authorized for up to
  approximately one month or one year of charges of service, as applicable, as soon as you subscribe. In some
  instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the
  authorization; however, no charges will be made against the payment method
  unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial. You may not
  receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paying
  portion of your monthly or annual subscription has begun. You are only permitted one free
  trial. If your subscription is ever terminated for any reason, and you
  purchase an additional subscription, you shall not be eligible for a
  free trial on any subsequent subscriptions.</p>

<p class=term-text>We may change the subscription terms or
  fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for
  your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity
  to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or
  charging your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal. If we
  notify you in advance of at least fifteen (15) days, your continued use of the
  Premium Features or other products and services associated with your
  subscription after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance
  of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or
  features, you may cancel your subscription. If you accept the new subscription,
  its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going
  forward. For information on the monthly and annual subscription fees and terms,
  please visit <a class="ga-click" data-ga-click-type="membership-payment-link-customer_support" href="/membership">MAL Supporter Page</a>.</p>

<p class=term-text>You may cancel your subscription service at
  any time in your account settings or by contacting us via our <a href="/about.php?go=support">Customer Support</a>. You
  must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next
  periodic subscription fees to your account. However, if you cancel a pre-paid
  annual or monthly subscription, you will not receive any refund. If you cancel
  your monthly or annual subscription, you will be able to use the purchased Premium
  Features and services for the remainder of your pre-paid subscription term.</p>

<p class=term-text>We may terminate your subscription at our
  discretion and without any notice. Fees for such services are refundable in
  Company's sole discretion. If we cancel your annual subscription, we will give
  you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining in your pre-paid
  subscription; provided, however, that Company will not be obligated to grant
  you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we
  determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service
  violates these Terms of Use or has harmed or damaged another user. Otherwise,
  there is no prorated refund of any fees upon any termination or cancellation. </p>

<p class=term-text>You agree to immediately pay any amounts
  accrued, but remaining unpaid, (if any), as of termination of your subscription. You hereby authorize
  Company to collect fees through various payment methods and information
  regarding such payment method you provide to us as part of your Member account
  information, either directly or indirectly via a third party online payment
  service.</p>

<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(C) Your Account and Profile Responsibilities:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>
  When creating your account or profile, you must provide complete and
  accurate information, and you must update your information to keep it accurate,
  current, and complete. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs
  on your profile or account, and you must keep the password for your profile or
  account secure at all times. You must notify the Company immediately should there
  be any unauthorized use or breach of security of your profile or account. To
  the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company will not be liable for your
  losses caused by any unauthorized use of your profile, account or purchase of Premium Features. However, to
  the extent permitted by applicable law, you shall be liable for any losses
  incurred by the Company or others due to any unauthorized use of your account,
  profile or purchase of Premium Features as a result of your wrongdoing, negligence or violation of these
  Terms of Use. You may never use another Member's profile, account or purchase of Premium Features without
  permission.</p>
  
<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(D) Use of Your Information:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>When you provide the Company with your email address, you consent
  to our using the email address in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Further,
  to ensure that moderators can be responsive to user and community needs, you
  understand that such moderators will have access to data associated with your
  account, including usage data (such as, but not limited to, anime and manga
  lists with update history and public forum information) and registration data
  (such as, but not limited to, email address, current and previous usernames,
  current IP and previous IP addresses associated with registration, login(s) and
  failed login(s)). You authorize moderators to review such information as
  reasonably necessary to investigate complaints, respond to appeals, or for such
  other purposes as contemplated in the Privacy Policy or these Terms of Use.</p>

<p class=term-text>Please keep in mind that information you
  provide in any community profiles may be searchable by the general public
  unless you set your profile to &quot;Private.&quot; To change your profile
  privacy settings, go to your account’s profile page’s account settings, where
  you may also change your profile information and who can view your page, as
  well as control how we communicate with you. All postings you make in community
  forums may be viewed by the public unless such forum topic is designated as
  “private.”</p>
  
<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(E) Certain Prohibited Activities:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>You agree not to use the communication systems provided by the
  Service for any commercial solicitation purposes nor collect any personally
  identifiable information or any account or profile names, from the Service. You
  also agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without
  limitation, &quot;offline readers,&quot; &quot;spiders,&quot;
  &quot;robots,&quot; etc., that accesses the Service for any malicious purpose
  or in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a
  human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional
  on-line web browser, and you agree not to collate or aggregate any of the
  content available through the Service for use elsewhere.</p>

<p class="term-text mt8"><u>(F) Company’s Suspension or Termination of Access:</u></p>
<p class=term-text>In the Company's sole discretion, the
  Company may temporarily or permanently suspend, terminate, or otherwise refuse

  moderators who may be employees or contractors of MyAnimeList, moderating
  MyAnimeList is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to certain
  Users.&nbsp;Moderating activities and any content or communications posted,
  sent, transmitted or otherwise made available by moderators on or through the
  Services is User Content and subject to Section 5 above and other terms and
  conditions pertaining to User Content herein. We may change the features or
  abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice.
  &nbsp;We reserve the right to revoke or limit a User’s ability to moderate at

  of Use. </p>

  contains links to various guidelines for moderators and Users of a particular
  subject.</p>

<p class=term-text>If selected and you choose to become a
  MyAnimeList moderator:</p>

<ul class="ul-list list-style">
  <li>You agree to provide an email

  <li>You agree that when you

    moderators for review as appropriate;
  </li>

    approval;
  </li>
  <li>You may not perform moderation
    actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third
    parties;
  </li>
  <li>Moderators may not represent

    in any way;
  </li>
  <li>If you have access to
    non-public information through your role as a moderator, or as a result of
    moderating a MyAnimeList thread or community, you will safeguard that
    information and not disclose it except as may be required by these Terms
    of Use, the Company or applicable law, and you will only use such
    non-public information as reasonably necessary in connection with your
    performance moderating services; and
  </li>
  <li>You may create and enforce
    rules for the MyAnimeList threads and communities that you moderate,
    provided that such rules are consistent with and do not conflict with
    these Terms of Use. You may also have the ability to ban Users who violate
    these Terms of Use or otherwise act maliciously, unlawfully or
    inappropriately. Appeals from Users to your actions should be taken
    seriously, and moderator responses to appeals from Users should be
    consistent, germane to the issue raised, and focused on educating that User
    about conduct in accordance with the rules.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class=term-text>MyAnimeList reserves the right, but has no
  obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator, if MyAnimeList
