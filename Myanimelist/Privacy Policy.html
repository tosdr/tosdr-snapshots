<h2><a name="_Toc17165258">1. Scope</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">This Privacy Policy is applicable
  only to the Sites and does not extend to information collected by any other
  websites or applications or to the practices or procedures of companies that
  the Company does not control. Note that the Sites may contain links to (or otherwise integrate with) other
  websites or applications, such as ad banners linking to another website. In such cases, this
  Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected on that website or application.
  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
  websites or applications, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website
  that you visit or application that you use.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165259">2. What information the Sites

  and Interests Reports, social networking sites, databases, online marketing
  firms, our strategic business partners and ad targeting firms), including:</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165260">3. How we use the information that we collect</a></h2>

<h3>Advertising:</h3>

  targeted advertising that may be relevant to your preferences. Through this
  process, advertisers reach Sites visitors who are most interested in their
  products, and you see advertising for products or services in which you may be
  interested.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="term-text">By using the Sites, you consent to

<h2><a name="_Toc17165261">4. Information disclosures</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">The Company values your privacy, and discloses information about
  the Sites' users mentioned in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy to third parties
  with which the Company has a business relationship and only under certain circumstances,
  provided that the Company should be responsible for the management of such information.
  We will make information about you, including personal information, available to such
  third parties only in situations and for purposes listed below:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">We may
    employ the third parties to perform Sites-related services,
    including maintenance services, database management, data processing,
    analytics, marketing, and email and text message distribution. Access to your
    information is granted to these third parties only for the purpose of
    performing these tasks.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may
    disclose your information to our strategic business partners in connection with

    to you and our users.
  </li>

    to end users’ interactions with the Sites, such as, for example,
    statistics indicating what content is popular, to third parties for a fee or other consideration.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may
    disclose information about you to respond to judicial proceedings, court orders,
    or subpoenas, or search warrants, legal process, or other legal or law
    enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our rights, to comply with our
    legal obligations and/or to defend against legal actions or claims.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may
    disclose information about you to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding
    illegal or suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving

    person, violations of the Sites' <a href="/about/terms_of_use">Terms of Use</a>, or as
    otherwise required by law.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">If you
    choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as creating and using a profile, posting comments on

    information in public activities or submissions.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">From
    time to time, we may deploy technology such as application programming
    interfaces (or “APIs”) for use by third party application developers and make
    information concerning your public activities on the Sites, such as your
    comments on community message boards, available to third party websites and
    applications. If you use such third party websites and applications, they may
    also collect, process and disclose your information, including personal
    information. You should review the privacy policies of any third party websites
    or applications before using them.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may
    disclose information about you in the event that the Sites are acquired by a third
    party or third parties, or as part of a sale, merger, bankruptcy or change in
    control, or in preparation for any of these events.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may
    disclose information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time
    we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text">Please note that the third parties may independently
  collect data about you, through cookies, clicks on links,
  or other means when you visit or view ads on the Sites.</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">We work closely with our affiliated
  companies, such as our parent companies and their affiliated entities and
  subsidiaries under common ownership or control. We disclose your information to
  our affiliates that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow
  practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. In
  some cases, these affiliates may operate portions of the Sites or aspects of
  related services, or market or sell offerings to you. In other cases, we
  operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering
  jointly with these affiliates.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="_Toc17165262">5. Your choices, cookies and other
    tracking technologies and “do not track” signals</a></h2>

<h3>Deactivating your account</h3>

<p class="term-text">If the Sites functionality permits,
  you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page
  for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Sites, though we
  may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance
  purposes. When you deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled,
  but your public comments will remain on the Sites. We have no responsibility,
  other than as may be required by applicable law, to take down, remove, or edit
  any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your
  public activities. For more information, please review our <a href="/about/terms_of_use">Terms
    of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>Cookies and other tracking technologies</h3>

<p class="term-text">Some information that is collected
  about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking
  technologies. Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within
  your computer's browser. We may use these technologies to collect information
  about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you
  interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such
  as advertising. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if
  you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on
  your browser or device. However, please note that removing or rejecting cookies
  could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. Please see our
  <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more
  information about how we use cookies and your choices. <a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a></p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">
  Additionally, some of our services, including messaging, may use "click-through URLs" linked to other content on our Sites.
  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics, Sites usability, and other measures of user engagement.
</p>

<h3>“Do not track” signals</h3>

<p class="term-text">The “do not track” (or “DNT”)
  concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry
  to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the
  tracking of their online activities across websites. Various web browsers offer
  a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user’s browser
  about the user's DNT preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT
  option in your browser's “preferences” or similar settings. As of the time of
  the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT
  technology standard. We take privacy and security seriously. With regard to
  DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as
  mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted. However, as explained above,
  you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other
  similar technologies. </p>

<h3>Third Party Online Advertising</h3>

<p class="term-text">Some of the advertisements you see
  on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers,
  ad networks, and audience segment providers. These third parties may collect
  information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on
  other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand
  your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.</p>

<p class="term-text">The Company does not have control
  over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may
  collect. Such third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy
  Policy.</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">If you choose to opt out of having
  your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you
  will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may
  not be as relevant to you.</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">For more information about how we
  use cookies and your choices, please see our <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>. </p>

  information to us, you may update or amend this information by contacting us
  at <a href="mailto:legal@mail.myanimelist.net">legal@mail.myanimelist.net</a>.
  Please include in your email the name of the Site(s) to which you provided the
  information you wish to amend.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="_Toc17165264">7. California Residents</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">This Section 7 applies to users who are California residents. We include this Section 7 in our
  Privacy Policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and any
  terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Section 7.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Information We Collect</h3>

<p class="term-text pb16">We collect “personal information” as defined under the CCPA, which is information that
  identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or
  could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or
  device. Personal information does not include publicly available information from government
  records, deidentified or aggregated consumer information or information excluded from the
  CCPA’s scope. In particular, we have collected the following categories of personal information

<br>
<p class="term-text-italic">Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights:</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">As a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you
  about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text-italic">Correction and Deletion Request Rights:</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">As a California resident, you have the right to request that we correct inaccurate
  personal information or delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained,
  subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below
  “Exercising Your CCPA Access, Data Portability, Correction and Deletion Rights”), we will correct or
  delete (and direct our service providers to correct or delete) your personal information
  from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if keeping the
  information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good
    or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of
    our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or

  <li class="list-style">Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the
    public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the
    information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s
    achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based
    on your relationship with us.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the
    context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text-italic">Exercising Your CCPA Access, Data Portability, Correction and Deletion Rights:</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">To exercise the access, data portability, correction and deletion rights described above,
  please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by email at: <a
    href="mailto:legal@mail.myanimelist.net">legal@mail.myanimelist.net</a> or by regular mail at:
  MyAnimeList, Attn: Privacy Officer, 1-1-1 Hitotsubashi Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0003 Japan.</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable
  consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request
  on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
  data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must (a)
  provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
  we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request
  with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
  your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to
  you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We
  will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<Br>
<p class="term-text">We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt,
  but if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
  consumer request’s receipt. If we cannot comply with the request, our response will explain the
  reasons we cannot comply. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your
  personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the
  information from one entity to another entity. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to
  your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
  determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and
  provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text-italic">Personal Information Sales and Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights:</p>
<br>
<p class="term-text">If you are 16 years of age or older,
  you have the right to direct us to not sell or share (as those terms are defined in the CCPA) your
  personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell or share the personal information
  of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right
  to opt-in”)
  from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian
  of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Currently, MAL is working with its consent management platform
  provider to implement the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link functionality and,
  until it is implemented, MAL will continue to provide the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link
  and opt out functionality. MAL will not share (as defined by the CCPA) personal information until the
  “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link option is available. To exercise the right to opt-out,
  you can click on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link available on our homepage and other
  pages of this website. You can also opt-out by clicking this link here:
  <a href="#" onclick="window.__uspapi('displayUspUi');return false;">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>.
  You will then have the option of clicking on a toggle button or checking a box and confirming your
  choice to opt-out. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months
  before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind
  and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clicking on the “Do Not Sell My
  Personal Information” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again
  and confirming your choice to opt back in.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Non-Discrimination</h3>

<p class="term-text">We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted
  by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Deny you goods or services.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
    discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
    level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text">However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in
  different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will
  reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the
  program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt
  in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Other California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p class="term-text">If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section §

<p class="term-text">In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
  age 16 in Europe or under age 13 in the U.S. or elsewhere without verification of parental consent, we will delete such information. If
  you are a minor age 16 or over in Europe, a minor age 13 or over in the U.S. or elsewhere, or an individual considered a child in
  another jurisdiction, you may only use the Sites with the permission and under the supervision of your parent or
  guardian.</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Review, correct, or delete the child’s personal information; and/or</li>
  <li class="list-style">Revoke permission for us to further collect, use or disclose the child’s personal information.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165266">12. Confidentiality and security</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">We limit access to contact
  information about you to employees or service providers who we believe
  reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We also have adopted
  commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative procedures to
  help protect information about you from loss, unauthorized access, misuse, and alteration.
  In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information will provide sufficient protection of your personal information. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login password, or any national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited communication.
  </p>

  Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100%
  secure. We want you to feel confident using the Sites, but we cannot ensure or
  warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
  If you have any concerns with the way we collect and handle your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information held by us, please contact us. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request; please note, though, that at a minimum we may retain certain information if required by law.
