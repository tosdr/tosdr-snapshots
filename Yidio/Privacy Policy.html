<h1>Yidio Privacy Policy</h1>
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you at
<a href="https://www.yidio.com/" id="xk7510" title="Yidio">https://www.yidio.com/</a>
(the "Website") and Yidio applications
and how we use this information.<br id="yg2x0">
<br id="xk7512">
<b id="xk7513">Collection of your Yidio Information</b><br id="xk7514">
<br id="xk7515">
Your "Yidio information" includes certain technical information gathered
or received when you use Yidio. Some of the technical information that may
be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using
(e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are
using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), CPU type, your manner of connecting to
the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband
access); Internet protocol address; Apps Installed; information about the version of
service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the
service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain
name of your Internet service provider.<br id="xk7516">
<br id="xk7517">
While registering to use most of the Yidio services is not required, there
are a limited number of optional services (for example, saving a video
list) that require an "account". Registration functionality for Yidio is
provided by the Yidio Network. If you choose to "Register an Account", you
will need to register with and provide information to Yidio. You will then
obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by Yidio (collectively,
"Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and
your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the
Yidio Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your
registration process.<br id="xk7520">
<br id="xk7523">
<br id="xk7524">
<b id="xk7525">How Your Yidio information is Used</b><br id="xk7526">
<br id="xk7527">
Your Yidio information is used<br id="xk7528">
<br id="xk7529">
<ul id="xk7530" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 25px;">
<li id="xk7531">
to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available
through Yidio;
</li>
<li id="xk7532">
to personalize the content provided to you;
</li>
<li id="xk7533">
to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
</li>
<li id="xk7534">
to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
</li>
<li id="xk7535">
to conduct research about your use of Yidio; and
</li>
<li id="xk7536">
to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of
interest.
</li>
</ul>
<br id="xk7537">
Your Yidio information will not be shared with third parties unless it is
necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have
consented to the sharing of your Yidio information, or except as described
in this Privacy Policy. We may use your Yidio information to present
offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These
business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups
of Yidio users, but do not receive information that personally identifies
you.<br id="xk7538">
<br id="xk7539">
If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself
publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists
publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any
information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as
well as other information about you as a Yidio user, may be accessed and
disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search
warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Yidio is
being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief
that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or
another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property
or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render
the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order
to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to
your Yidio information, they are required to protect this information in a
manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not
using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services
they are performing for Yidio.<br id="xk7540">
<br id="xk7541">
In the event that ownership of us or the Yidio service was to change as a
result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Yidio
information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material
change in the use of your Yidio information, we will provide notice about
the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.<br id="xk7542">
<br id="xk7543">
<b id="xk7544">Your Choices About Your Information</b><br id="xk7545">
<br id="xk7546">
If you want to change your account information (for example, your Screen
Name) you will need to log onto Yidio and access your account through the
forum. Your access to your account information and choice will be governed
by the Yidio policies.<br id="xk7547">
