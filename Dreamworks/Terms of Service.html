You and We agree that We intend that this Arbitration Section satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  If binding arbitration is adjudged by a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of the Dispute Section (below) shall apply to all relevant disputes between You and Us.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that You may have with Us.  Therefore, pursuant to this Agreement, if You have any dispute or disagreement with Us regarding (i) Your use of or interaction with the Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships related to Your use of the Services, or (iii) any data or information You may provide to Us or that We may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, \u201cNBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships\u201d), You will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and You will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.  By using or interacting with the Services, or engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with Us, You agree to binding arbitration as provided below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that You may have with Us.  If those efforts fail, by using the Services, You agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement You may have against Us, and any claim that We may have against You, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) administered by JAMS or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d).  The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.  If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the \u201cAAA\u201d) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d in such circumstances).  If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the Arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, We agree to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to You to the extent they are more favorable than this Arbitration Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.  Furthermore, this Arbitration Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of Arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  You further agree that:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(a) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Arbitrator.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between You and Us (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d);&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(b) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement and\/or this Arbitration Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(c) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of Arbitration.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for You and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from Your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by You and Us; or (iii) at Your election, if the only claims in the Arbitration are asserted by You and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(d) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governing Law.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(e) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Class Relief.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitration can resolve only Your and\/or Our individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(f) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written Award.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator\u2019s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an \u201cAward\u201d).  Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(g) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Costs.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; In the event that You are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, We will pay as much of Your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that Your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(h) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; In the event You recover an Award greater than Our last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award Our reimbursement of Your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the Arbitration, but We shall in all events bear Our own attorneys\u2019 fees; and&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(i) &lt;span class=\&quot;terms-spacer-word\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/span&gt; With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this Arbitration Section is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this Arbitration Section shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
