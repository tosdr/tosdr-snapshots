How Sling communicates with you</strong></h4><p>As part of providing the Services, Sling (whether directly or through a third-party service provider), may send You various communications related to the Services. </p><p>The specific nature of the communications may vary depending on Your role as well as what specific services or requests you have made. These communications include:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing communications</strong>: If you are an Account Holder or an Application User with a manager account, we may send you marketing and other promotional communications for new or existing Services that we think you might be interested in.<ul><li>These marketing communications may be sent via email or may include marketing text messages if you have opted in to receive them. </li><li>You can opt out of or unsubscribe from any marketing communications by following the instructions in those messages, by changing your communications preferences within your account or through your device.

How long does Sling keep your personal information?</strong></h4><p>Sling retains personal information as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services, carry out the purposes described in this Statement, or as otherwise required in order to comply with our records retention periods (which reflect the applicable law). For example, we may retain information about users of our Services in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or to protect our interests as part of providing the Services.</p><p>In the majority of cases, Sling processes the personal information of Application Users as a processor on behalf of the Account Holder. As a result, Sling’s retention of the Account Holder’s employment-related information will be governed by the terms of the agreement between Sling and the Account Holder. Such information may also be managed independently by the Account Holder as part of its own obligations as part of managing its business. Sling maintains a retention schedule for the removal of this information following the termination of any such agreement with the Account Holder. </p><h4>8. Securing your information</h4><p>Sling will take appropriate steps to protect any personal information that we collect and store from unauthorized access, misuse, loss, and destruction by employing administrative, technical, and physical security measures. However, even though we have taken such measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that the collection, transmission and storage of personal information will always be completely secure.</p><h4>9. Your rights with regard to your personal information</h4><p><strong>Overview </strong></p><p>Depending on your location, you may have specific individual rights under the applicable law in relation to how we process your personal information. These individual rights may include a right of deletion, access, correction, portability as well as rights in relation to various processing restrictions (e.g., sale, sharing and targeted advertising).

If you are under the age of 16, you have the right to opt in, or to have a parent or guardian opt in on your behalf, to such sales or sharing. </li><li>The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information: to the extent that we use sensitive personal information for purposes beyond those set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 1798.121, you have the right to limit the use or disclosure of that sensitive personal information subject to the exceptions within the CCPA.</li><li>The right of access to and to the ability to opt-out of automated decision-making technology: subject to further regulations being issued, you have the right to access information pertaining to automated decision-making technologies and the ability to opt out.</li><li>The right against discrimination and retaliation: you have the right to not be discriminated or retaliated against as a result of exercising any of the above rights. </li></ul><p>However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you with our Services or engage with you in the same manner. In addition, the exercise of the rights described above may result in a different price, rate, or quality level of product or service where that difference is reasonably related to the impact the right has on our relationship or is otherwise permitted by law.</p><p>Please note that your ability to invoke the rights above are limited pursuant to the scope and limitations of the CCPA, including any available exceptions. For example, an access request can only be made twice by a Consumer within a 12-month period. </p><p>D. <strong>How to invoke your rights</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sling has established an individual rights portal as well as other channels for the purposes of submitting the individual rights requests above, including the right of access and deletion. Individual rights requests can be submitted to Sling through the below channels:</p><ul><li><strong>Web portal:</strong> <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/privacy/individualrightscenter">Individual Rights Portal</a></li><li><strong>By email: </strong>    <a href="mailto:privacy@getsling.com">privacy@getsling.com</a> </li><li><strong>By post:   </strong>     <br />Attn: Toast Privacy Office<br />Toast, Inc.<br />333 Summer Street Boston, MA 02210</li><li><strong>By phone (toll-free): </strong>(866) 226-4484</li></ul><p>Once an individual rights request has been submitted, Sling may ask you for additional information in order to verify your identity or to provide additional details to help us respond to your request. This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of Sling’s Services. Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law.  In these instances, we will take steps to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by the applicable law in relation to individual rights submissions.</p><p>E. <strong>To Exercise the Right to Opt Out of the Selling or Sharing of Personal Information </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you have exercised your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, we may “sell” or “share” your personal data to third parties for targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, for personalization features and for tracking and analytics purposes. The third parties to whom we sell or share personal information may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements. In these instances, the right to opt out of the sale of personal information can be invoked through our cookie management tool that can be accessed by clicking on our “Do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of <a href="https://getsling.com">https://getsling.com</a>. You can also opt out of the “sale” of personal information or “sharing” for targeted advertising purposes by enabling the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org">Global Privacy Control</a> or a similar opt-out preference setting within the browser you use to access our Websites. Please note that your opt out will be specific to the device and browser you use when you opt out, and our Websites will recognize opt-out preference settings only on domains of our Websites where any “selling” or “sharing” occurs.  Although Sling does not currently engage in other practices at this time that may constitute a “sale” or “sharing” beyond these instances and the methods above are the most effective methods to manage your preferences, you may also submit your right to opt out of any sales or sharing by <a rel="nofollow" role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="function togglePreferenceCenter(){if(!!OneTrust){OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();}}togglePreferenceCenter();">clicking here</a> or in instances where you would like additional support. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales or sharing. However, if applicable, we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you in our dataset and to track compliance with your opt out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent we are able to identify you in our systems. Once you make an opt-out request, you may change your mind and opt back in to future personal information sales at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getsling.com">privacy@getsling.com</a> or by managing your preferences within the cookie management tool.</p><p>F. <strong>Accessibility</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the event you are a user with a disability, or are supporting an individual with a disability, and are having difficulty navigating this Statement or the information linked within this Statement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getsling.com">privacy@getsling.com</a> for support. </p><p>G. <strong>Sensitive Personal Information</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As part of our services, Sling collects “sensitive personal information” as defined by the CCPA as part of our operations and the Services offered to our Account Holders. The categories of sensitive personal information are described below along with the use case and whether the information is sold or shared.</p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Category of sensitive personal information</td><td>Use/Purpose</td><td>Is the sensitive personal information sold?</td><td>Is the sensitive personal information shared?</td></tr><tr><td>Account log-in details plus password or credentials</td><td><ul><li>Account Holders &#8211; needed to access the Sling account</li><li>Application Users – needed to access the Sling services</li></ul></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Precise geolocation</td><td><ul><li>Account Holders (in their capacity as an Application User) &#8211; needed for clocking in and out of shifts and only collected where you have enabled location services on your device. </li><li>Application Users &#8211; needed for clocking in and out of shifts and only collected where you have enabled location services on your device.</li></ul></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Presently, Sling does not use or disclose an individual’s sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in subdivision (a) of section 1798.121 of the CCPA and as a result, has not included a Notice of Right to Limit.</p><p><strong>H.  Retention</strong></p><p><br />We retain personal information as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services and carry out the purposes described in this Statement. However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, or for instances where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority.  </p><p>To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations. </p><p>The retention period will vary depending on our relationship. For example,</p><ul><li>For Account Holders, we will generally retain their personal information for the duration of our agreement with the Account Holder plus a period following termination as provided for in our retention schedules. </li><li>For Application Users, Sling will generally maintain Application User accounts that are required to access an Application Holder’s account page for the duration of the individual’s use of Services plus a period of inactivity.  Application Users are also permitted to remove these user accounts on an ad hoc basis when relevant (e.g., the individual is no longer part of an Account Holder’s organization). </li></ul><p>In all cases, the retention will be subject to any additional legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other applicable obligations.</p><p>Once retention of the personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.</p><p>I. <strong>Notice of Financial Incentives </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Sling nor the Services contemplate any program or service involving financial incentives or requiring notification of a financial incentive. This Statement does not take into account any obligations imposed on the independent businesses of our Account Holders based on their operations.  </p><p><strong>J.   Deidentified information</strong></p><p>We may at times receive, or process personal information to create, deidentified information that can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual or household. Where we maintain deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information except as required or permitted by law.</p><p><strong>K.  Updates to this Statement</strong></p><p>We will update this Statement from time to time. When we make changes to this Statement, we will change the &#8220;Last updated&#8221; date at the beginning of this Statement.

California “Shine the Light” disclosure</strong><br />As applicable to Sling and our Services, California residents that have an established business relationship with us have a right to know how their information is disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civ.
