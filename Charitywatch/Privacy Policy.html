<p><b><a id="Privacy_Policy" name="Privacy_Policy"></a>CharityWatch Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
<strong>Introduction &amp; Scope</strong><br>
The American Institute of Philanthropy, dba CharityWatch (herein referred to as “CharityWatch,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), respects the privacy of our donors and web site visitors and are committed to protecting personal information entrusted to us. This document describes our policy related to the gathering and disseminating of information obtained from users of our services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to CharityWatch’s hard copy publications and its web site located at <strong><a href="/home">www.charitywatch.org</a></strong> (“Site” or “Web Site”). The policy relates to information we collect, including personally identifiable information as well as information that does not identify donors and Web Site users personally. Our Web Site contains links to third-party web sites for the convenience of its visitors. This policy does not apply to web sites owned or operated by other organizations, companies, or individuals, as these third-parties may have their own privacy policies related to the information they collect from you.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Types of Personally Identifiable Information Collected &amp; How It May Be Used</strong><br>
CharityWatch collects and stores the personally identifiable information of its donors, members, and others who have contacted or requested information from CharityWatch. Such information may include names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. <strong>We do not share personal information—such as names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses—with anyone, except to the extent necessary to process transactions and provide access to, or information about, CharityWatch's information and services</strong>. CharityWatch takes practical measures to protect the personal information we collect and does not disclose this information to&nbsp; third-parties for their marketing or fundraising purposes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Names</strong></em><br>
CharityWatch collects first and/or last names voluntarily provided to us by donors, members, visitors to our Web Site, and others who have requested information from us, or who have contacted us via phone, postal mail, email, or our Web Contact Form located at <strong><a href="/contact"><u>www.charitywatch.org/contact</u></a></strong>. We may use these names to process transactions and provide access to, or information about, CharityWatch's information and services, or for the purpose of contacting members, donors, and others about their online user accounts, membership information, tax receipts for&nbsp; donations, renewal notices, donor alerts, and occasional fundraising efforts.</p>

<p><em><strong>Email Addresses</strong></em><br>
CharityWatch collects email addresses voluntarily provided to us by donors, members, visitors to our Web Site, and others who have requested information from us, or who have contacted us via phone, postal mail, email, or our Web Contact Form located at <strong><a href="/contact">www.charitywatch.org/contact<u>.</u></a></strong> In accordance with our Terms of Use, CharityWatch members, journalists, and others who choose to create online accounts to gain access to restricted content on our Site are required to provide us with a current email address.</p>

<p>We may use the email addresses we have collected to communicate with CharityWatch members and others who have voluntarily provided their email addresses to us. Such communications are typically regarding online user accounts, membership information, tax receipts for online donations, renewal notices, donor alerts, and occasional fundraising efforts.</p>

<p><em><strong>Mailing Addresses</strong></em><br>
CharityWatch collects mailing addresses voluntarily provided to us by our donors and others in order to distribute the hard copy version of our publication, the <em>Charity Rating Guide &amp; Watchdog Report </em>(<em>Guide</em>)<em>. </em>We may also use these addresses to send tax receipts for offline donations; membership renewal reminders; and information related to CharityWatch news, announcements, and fundraising efforts. Donors making an online Membership contribution may opt-in to receive the hard copy <em>Guide </em>during the check-out process on CharityWatch's Membership page located at <strong><a href="/join">www.charitywatch.org/join</a></strong>. Existing Members with current Memberships can opt-in to receive the hard copy <em>Guide</em> when initially claiming their online accounts at <strong><a href="/claim">www.charitywatch.org/claim</a></strong>. Members who do not have reliable Internet access or who otherwise prefer to receive a hard copy <em>Guide</em> are automatically opted-in to receiving the paper publication when they send in a Membership donation via paper check unless they otherwise communicate their desire to opt-out.</p>

<p><em><strong>Credit Cards &amp; Highly Sensitive Information</strong></em><br>
CharityWatch does not store highly sensitive information, such as credit card data, from our visitors or donors. The portion of our Web Site on which credit card donations are processed is operated by a third-party transaction processor, PayPal, which takes measures to protect sensitive information using a variety of safeguards including encryption, firewalls, and other access controls.<br>

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>User IDs &amp; Passwords</strong><br>
CharityWatch members, journalists, and others who choose to create online accounts to gain access to restricted content on our Site have unique user IDs and passwords.
