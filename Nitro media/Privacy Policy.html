    <p>By completing the online form you expressly consent to receive text message, autodialed and/or prerecorded calls from us, our marketing partners and the parties listed on the Site. I understand that consenting is not required to make any purchase.</p>

    <p>Nitro may use Information collected in connection with the Site in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>To improve the user experience with the Site</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In order to do the foregoing, Nitro may provide your Information to trusted third parties, including but not limited to selected third party marketers and vendors as well as third party contractors providing services to Nitro for the operation of the Site and its business, communication services and fulfillment of orders. Email address will only be provided to a select mailing partner for the purpose of sending third-party promotional emails. Nitro will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit use of the Information by such third parties to the specific uses set forth above.  Nitro also utilizes electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of Information during transmission and storage, but cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the Information.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Access to Information.</strong></u></p>
    <p>Users may modify and correct certain Information through a written request sent to Nitro Media, 132 Mill Road, Moncton, NB, Canada E1C 9V8.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong></u></p>
    <p>Nitro reserves the right to revise and update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such revisions will be effective on the date of posting to the Site, and will apply to all information collected by Nitro both prior to and following the effective date.

Users should periodically visit this page to review the current policies with regard to Information.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Opting Out from Offers from Nitro.</strong></u></p>
    <p>At any time, a user may opt out from receiving future offers from Nitro by following the instructions contained within each marketing communication.  Such opting out will not apply to any communications from third parties to whom Nitro may have provided Information regarding the user.  Third parties’ use of the Information is subject to such parties’ own privacy policies, for which Nitro shall not be responsible.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong></u></p>
    <p>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Nitro who are California residents to request certain information regarding Nitro’s disclosure of personal information for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to: Nitro Media, 132 Mill Road, Moncton, NB, Canada E1C 9V8. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, Nitro will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year.  Nitro reserves its right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.</p>
    <p>Many browsers including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome contain a “do not track” optional setting. In general, when a “do not track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies websites that the user does not want the user’s personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities tracked over time and across different Web sites or online services. Websites are not required to honor a do not track request and as required by amendments to the California Shine the Light law, we are informing you that we do not honor such requests.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Privacy Notice for California Residents</strong></u></p>
    <p>This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in our privacy policy above and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Information We Collect</strong></u></p>

                <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><u><strong>Deletion Request Rights</strong></u></p>
    <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
    <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
        <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
        <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
        <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>

        <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>

        <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>

    </ol>

    <p><u><strong>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</strong></u></p>
    <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By writing us at: Nitro Media, 132 Mill Road, Moncton, NB, Canada E1C 9V8</li>
        <li>Visiting https://docs.corepassage.com/ccparequest.aspx to fill out a CCPA request form.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></u></p>
    <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong></u></p>
    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</strong></u></p>

    <p><u><strong>Arbitration Agreement.</strong></u></p>
    <p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement (the “Agreement”) carefully. THIS AGREEMENT STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT. You accept when you do any of the following things after an opportunity to review this agreement: give us a written or electronic signature; tell us orally or electronically that you accept; submit information to us on our website. This Agreement affects your legal rights and remedies and provides that disputes between you and Nitro Media (the “Company”), must be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in a court.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Resolution Of Claims or Disputes.</strong></u></p>
    <p>Nitro hopes to make you a happy customer and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by email our customer service department. If, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, this Agreement describes how both of us will proceed. Any claim or dispute between you and Nitro (or any of Company’s subsidiaries or affiliates) arising out of or relating in any way to the product or this Agreement shall be resolved through final, binding arbitration. This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of our relationship; claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement; and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Limitation of Legal Remedies.</strong></u></p>
    <p>We each agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations under this Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong></u></p>
    <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and setting forth the specific relief sought. All Notices to Nitro shall be sent to the following address: Nitro Media, 132 Mill Road, Moncton, NB, Canada E1C 9V8. Upon receipt of such Notice, the other party shall have a thirty-day period in which it may satisfy the claim against it by fully curing the dispute and/or providing all the relief requested in the Notice. After the expiration of such thirty-day cure period, you or Nitro may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) United States Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its web site at www.adr.org. The arbitration of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be conducted in the State of New York or in the location in which you received this Agreement or in your home state. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $25,000, Nitro will pay all costs of the arbitration and will agree to conduct the arbitration through the AAA offices in your home state. For any claim under $10,000, Nitro further agrees that any hearings may be held by telephone and that Nitro will not seek attorney’s fees in the event Nitro prevails. You acknowledge and agree that each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Choice of Law.</strong></u></p>
    <p>This Agreement concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.</p>

    <p><u><strong>Severability.</strong></u></p>
    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions shall remain fully enforceable.</p>

    <p>California Residents: Pursuant to Section 1798.120 of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a consumer shall have the right, at any time, to direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information.</p>
