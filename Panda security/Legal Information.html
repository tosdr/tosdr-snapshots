Email addresses are also used to send welcome emails during the onboarding process and security messages to the users. They can also be used for marketing purposes. Contact information is provided by users at their own discretion. Location. Anti-theft, Family, and Employee Control features obtain and store the location of the user’s devices to track them and send them alerts in case of entry/exit of control zones. The app needs to use the device's location to provide the said features even when it is closed or not in use. This location information is not shared with third parties or used for advertising purposes, and is only accessible by the account owner, the supervisor users from their devices, and the Web consoles of the Anti-Theft, Family and Employee Control features. Installed apps. The product uses the list of apps installed on the device to perform an antivirus scan of them for threats and to get the list of installed apps to monitor their use and apply usage restrictions on them for parental/employee control purposes. Application usage statistics. Application usage statistics are obtained so that supervisors can monitor the use of the applications by the supervised devices. Contacts. The user's contact information is used to block calls from unknown numbers and provide call block reports grouped by contact. Statistic data/Analytics. Information about the user's interaction with the product is uploaded to optimize the user experience and to detect and correct possible errors when they appear. Camera. A photo is taken when the user requests it in the context of an anti-theft action on a lost or stolen device. Unique identifier of the mobile device. This ID is generated by Android and is unique per device up to Android 7, or per device and application signature from Android 8 onwards. It is required to manage and perform actions on a specific device (anti-theft, family, etc.). </li><br />

<li>	To enable the Society to send you offers or advertising and promotional communications by any means (including email) concerning other products or services offered by Panda Security, or to carry out other marketing activities such as sending newsletters to registered users.

If you do not consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose set out above, you will not receive any marketing communications from Panda Security. </li><br />

 <p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Panda Security takes reasonable precautions, including organizational, technical, and physical measures, to help safeguard your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites after your sessions. If you have any questions about the security of our websites, contact us (see "<a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/privacy-policy#contact">How to Contact Us</a>" below).</p>

 <p><strong>STORAGE AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
