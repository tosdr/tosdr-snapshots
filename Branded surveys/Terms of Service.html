                    correctly identifies the posted points or Panel Currency, incentives, or rewards, and reflects all
                    of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or
                    debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to <a

				<p class="p-text p-0">All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth

                    the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
                    small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
                    of this Section 22 (this “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
                    arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
                    Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
                    successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
                    services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
                    Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
                    dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
                    300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
                    Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
                    claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
                    arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
                    the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
                    either party is entitled.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
                    (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“<strong>ADR
                        Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
                    available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
                    the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
                    method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
                    with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) governing
                    the arbitration are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted
                    by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
                    is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
                    non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
                    where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
                    right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
                    location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
                    unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
                    parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
                    shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
                    arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
                    online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
                    initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
                    or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
                    the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
                    imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
                    and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
                    cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
                    part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
                    any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                    under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
                    statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                    including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
                    relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
                    is final and binding upon you and Dynata.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
                    IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
                    arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
                    more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
                    review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
                    federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
                    WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
                    LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
                    USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
                    USER.</p>
				<p class="p-text p-0">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
                    and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
                    confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
                    submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
                    arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this

						website(s) or webpage(s) for redeeming rewards, incentives, and prizes, and/or may be described in
						any newsletter or other communication distributed or published by Dynata.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">The various types of incentives and rewards Dynata may provide are to encourage participation in the
						Panel and are not compensation for time spent. Any points or Panel Currency that is earned or paid
						to you or any reward that is redeemed by you for participation in the Research or other activity on
						a Panel is not calculated based on time spent by you. Similarly, any consideration paid to or points
						earned by you for participation is not pro-rated on an hourly basis or otherwise.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0"> B. All points or Panel Currency posted to a Panel member’s account expire one (1) year following
						posting, unless the points or Panel Currency are forfeited or canceled earlier due to membership or
						account inactivity or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Panel member accounts are not actual
						bank or financial accounts and do not accrue or accumulate interest of any kind.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">C. Points or Panel Currency posted in connection with the Applications/Services do not constitute
						property of the Panel member, cannot be transferred during or after the Panel member’s life, by

						Panel member’s account, Dynata may remove them from the Panel member’s account.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">E. In the event that any points, Panel Currency, or incentive have been obtained and/or posted to a
						Panel member’s account through fraudulent means, Dynata will remove them from the Panel member’s
						account and the account may be suspended and/or terminated.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(1) Points or Panel Currency will be deducted from the Panel member's account at the time the
						redemption request is made.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(2) All redemptions are final, and rewards may not be returned for credit except as otherwise
						provided in these Terms or as otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of
						Dynata.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(3) The minimum points or Panel Currency redemption threshold required to redeem a reward is the
						equivalent of Fifty United States Dollars ($50). Unless there is a lower redemption option
						available, if you do not satisfy the foregoing threshold, you will not have a redemption option
						under Dynata’s rewards program. Dynata reserves the right to provide reward options with lower
						minimum redemption thresholds without prior notice to or consent from you.</p>

						to verify your identity through our third party ID verification service provider's platform. In all cases, such service providers shall be subject to appropriate agreements concerning data processing, confidentiality, etc.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">G. Dynata may modify, alter, delete or add new terms and conditions for its rewards program or the

						modifying, altering, adding or deleting point values, redemption levels, conversion ratios,
						conditions for status, conditions for membership and conditions for earning incentives or rewards,
						at any time without notice. In addition, Dynata may terminate or cease offering any incentive or
						reward in connection with Dynata’s rewards program, at any time without notice.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">H. You may not combine your points or Panel Currency with points or Panel Currency belonging to any
						other member, including, but not limited to, any family member or friend.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">I. Dynata make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding any

						THE PANEL MEMBER. Dynata may provide you and/or the appropriate government agency or taxing
						authority with information related to any payments or incentives you earn in connection with your
						use of the Applications/Services. You agree to provide Dynata with all required information to
						assist Dynata in complying with its reporting or withholding obligations. Dynata may withhold any
						tax from any incentive or reward as required by applicable law.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">K. Dynata uses reasonable efforts to ensure that points or Panel Currency are credited and debited appropriately; however, the Panel member should review their account to ensure that their account correctly identifies the posted points or Panel Currency, incentives, or rewards, and reflects all of the appropriate redemption transactions. If you feel that your account was not credited or debited correctly or reflects incorrect redemption transactions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@gobranded.com">customerservice@gobranded.com</a>. Any email sent to Dynata
						should include the Panel member’s name, email address and specific information on the subject matter. Dynata will use reasonable efforts to investigate the matter and to respond back to the Panel member promptly. Dynata's decision is final and binding.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">L. The suppliers or providers of the products or services offered in connection with Dynata’s
						rewards program and/or the owners or operators of the website(s)/webpage(s) on which redemption
						transactions occur, may have their own terms and conditions; please review these terms and
						conditions carefully.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">M. Personal information may have to be collected, processed and/or disclosed in connection with
						Dynata’s rewards program and/or any request to redeem a reward or incentive. By agreeing to these
						Terms, you hereby agree to the collection, processing and/or disclosure of your personal information
						for such purpose(s) and all such personal information shall be subject to the terms set forth in

						<p class="p-text p-0">N. If a Panel member elects to donate points or Panel Currency to one of the charities approved by
						Dynata, Dynata will donate said points or Panel Currency to the selected charity. The donation is

						Dynata. Please check the redemption options available for the panel to which you belong.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">O. Your daily limit on the redemption of points or Panel Currency is limited to two (2) redemptions per 24-hour period.</p>

						more in a tax year; and (ii) file a 1099-Misc form with the United States Internal Revenue Service
						(“IRS”) for such payments. In addition, Dynata will provide you with a completed 1099-Misc form for
						your tax compliance purposes. As a result, please see the following:</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or participate in surveys) for the remainder of the applicable tax year unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(2) If you have received payments of $600 or more during a tax year, your account will be suspended
						indefinitely (i.e., you will not be able to receive further payments and will not be able to
						complete or participate in surveys) unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and
						verified W-9 form. In this case, your account will not be reinstated at the beginning of the next
						tax year, unless or until you provide Dynata with a completed and verified W-9 form.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">(3) You agree to provide Dynata with your then-current address information. You have the responsibility to update Dynata on any change of address and Dynata is not responsible for any misdirected communication based on your failure to do so.</p>

						22. Arbitration Agreement (United States only)
					</div>
					<div id="arbitration_agreement_xs" class="collapse" role="tabpanel" data-parent="#tos-xs-toggle" >
						<p class="p-text p-0">All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth
						below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to
						the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in
						small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms
						of this Section 22 (this “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). Unless otherwise agreed, all
						arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
						Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
						successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
						services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written
						Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or
						dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite
						300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and
						Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the
						claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
						arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to
						the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
						either party is entitled.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
						(“<strong>JAMS</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“<strong>ADR
                        Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not
						available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of
						the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
						method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
						with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) governing
						the arbitration are available online at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">https://www.jamsadr.com/</a>. The arbitration shall be conducted
						by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
						is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
						non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes
						where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
						right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
						location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
						unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
						parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
						award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
						shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the
						arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
						online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
						initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
						or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within
						the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline
						imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
						and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
						cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
						part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or
						any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to
						award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
						under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
						statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
						including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
						relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
						is final and binding upon you and Dynata.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
						IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
						arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited,
						more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited
						review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or
						federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
						WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
						LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR
						USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
						USER.</p>
						<p class="p-text p-0">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator
						and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
