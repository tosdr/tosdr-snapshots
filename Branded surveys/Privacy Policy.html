				<p class="p-text">This "Privacy Policy" is intended to cover residents and persons located within the United States.</p>
				<p class="p-text"><strong>This Version: Effective October 06, 2022</strong></p>
				<p class="p-text">The following sets forth the privacy policy for the Dynata,LLC f/k/a Survey Sampling International, LLC online panel communities, the Dynata,LLC f/k/a Survey Sampling International, LLC panel websites and/or the Dynata,LLC f/k/a Survey Sampling International, LLC mobile applications (collectively "Application/Services") offered by Dynata,LLC f/k/a Survey Sampling International, LLC and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies (collectively "<strong>Dynata</strong>").</p>
				<p class="p-text">This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information ("<strong>PII</strong>") and other information by Dynata in connection with Dynata's Services as defined herein and other Dynata and third party activities as defined herein ("Non-Research Activities"). Dynata's Services provide you with the opportunity to join a panel, participate in surveys administered by Dynata or by third parties (whether as a panel member or a non-panel member), use the websites associated with the panels, use the Application/Services associated with the panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively "<strong>Services</strong>"). Non-Research Activities include, but are not limited to, Dynata marketing Dynata Services and/or third parties marketing their services to you and/or sharing individual and/or aggregate profile data with third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models. Non-Research Activities are described in more detail in this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p class="p-text">Your use of Dynata's Application/Services is completely voluntary and therefore Dynata's processing of your PII in connection with the Application/Services and Non-Research Activities and this Privacy Policy is with your consent.</p>
				<p class="p-text">Surveys administered by third parties and the data collected in connection therewith are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Registration with, use of, and access to Dynata's Services is subject to <a href="/page/branded-surveys-terms-of-service/">Dynata's Terms and Conditions</a>. In most cases Dynata is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data will be owned by the sponsor of the survey.</p>
				
				<p class="p-text">All references in this Privacy Policy to "Dynata" include Dynata and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to "us" or "we" refer to Dynata. All PII is stored on servers located in the United States, where Dynata's servers are located and accessible globally to Dynata employees and/or agents. For purposes of this policy, respondent shall mean any individual who participates in Dynata Services, including passive data collection and/or participates in the Non-Research Activities described herein. For purposes of this policy, online shall include mobile web browsing,</p>
				
				<p class="header" id="information_collected">What personal data and other information does the Application/Services collect and how is it used?</p>

"<strong>Sensitive Data</strong>" means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p class="text"><strong>Information collected through automated means:</strong></p>
				
				<p class="p-text">The Application/Services also collect certain information automatically, such as information about your device and device capabilities, including, without limitation, the device operating system, the other applications on your device, IP address, device network provider, device type, time zone, network status, browser type, browser identifier, unique device identification number (such as identifiers for analytics or advertising), network provider user ID (a number uniquely allocated to you by your network provider), Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity, location and other information that alone or in combination may be used to uniquely identify your device.

In addition, Dynata may share your geo-location data with third party vendors to generate surveys for market research and for other research from aggregated location patterns. Please visit this <a href="https://sense360.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> for a description of how our partner uses the geo-location data.</p>
				
				<p class="p-text">Geo-location data also may be used by ad networks to provide you with location-based advertising. The ad networks' use of data, and how to opt out, are described in more detail below.</p>

With respect to the linking of Application/Services data to third party DMP data, Dynata uses such data itself and/or permits Dynata's clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using "look alike" cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party's products/services to you.</p>
				
				<p class="p-text"><strong>Retargeting</strong>. Dynata may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an Dynata website(s) or to manage Dynata's advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). Dynata's third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements. Including but not limited to your IDFA or Advertising ID to gather information about your activities on Dynata's website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about Dynata and its services and/or (ii) assist Dynata in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If Dynata is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in Dynata's separate cookie notice, by modifying your IDFA or Advertising ID and/or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself.

				<p class="p-text"><strong>Audience Insights/Look-alikes</strong>. Dynata and/or third parties may use Personal Data and/or may link Personal Data to a third-party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns.</p>
				
				<p class="p-text"><strong>Online Advertising Effectiveness</strong>. In connection with Dynata's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that Dynata is testing for its clients.

The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, Dynata's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and Dynata's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, Dynata's client will send your UID and the specific survey to Dynata and Dynata will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.</p>
				
				<p class="p-text"><strong>Audience Measurement Data</strong>.

				<p class="p-text">You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "<strong>Information collected through automated means</strong>" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes.

To facilitate the completion of these surveys, Dynata's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a "<strong>Third Party Technology</strong>" and collectively the "<strong>Third Party Technologies</strong>"). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, Dynata's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and Dynata's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion.

						<p class="p-text">You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "<strong>Information collected through automated means</strong>" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes.
