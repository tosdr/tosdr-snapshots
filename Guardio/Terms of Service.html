Over a million people use Guardio, and trust it to keep them, and their families safe online. And that number is growing daily. <br\/> But don\u2019t just take our word for it. There are several ways you can verify for yourself if Guardio is legit. <br\/> First off, Guardio is a Chrome extension, so it\u2019s listed on internet browser stores like Google Chrome Web Store, and Microsoft Edge Add-Ons. Look up Guardio you\u2019ll see it has a four-and-a-half star rating, and there are plenty of customer reviews to read. And if you\u2019re looking on the Google Chrome Web Store, you\u2019ll also notice that Guardio has an Established Publishger badge, which in Google\u2019s words means that it \u201chas a good record with no history of violations.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s kind of a Google stamp that Guardio is genuine and legit. It\u2019s worth noting that because some of our products deal with sensitive information, we are bound by some very strict rules and regulations from Google. <br\/>  Second, Guardio has been written about in several industry magazines, such as Wired, TechRadar, TechCrunch, The Hacker News, and Security Week, among others. These publications are kind of tech-oriented and sometimes on the dense side, but on the other hand, they know what they\u2019re talking about! <br\/>  And third, in January 2022 Gardio secured $47million in Series A funding led by Tiger Global, with Emerge, Vintage, Cerca Partners, Union, and Samsung Next also participating. We consider that an absolute stamp of legitimacy. ","id":"Is guratio legit","title":"Is Guardio Legit?"},{"answer":"Guardio is trusted by more than a million people already. In other words, more than 1 million people are using Guardio to protect their computer, their online identity, and their most intimate, sensitive data. Think for a second about what you have on your computer and what you do online: bank accounts, credit card accounts, insurance, social security details, photographs, medical records, even your favorite kind of pizza order. <br\/>  But don\u2019t take our word for it. Take a look at what our customers say about us - and yes, we publish the good and the bad feedback.

They give the Featured badge to \u201cextensions that follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.\u201d The Established badge means Guardio has \u201cestablished a consistent positive track record with Google services and compliance with the Developer Program Policy.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s kind of a Google stamp that Guardio is genuine and does exactly what it says.","id":"Is Guardio Trustworthy?","title":"Is Guardio Trustworthy?"},{"answer":"We love this question.

They give the Featured badge to \u201cextensions that follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.\u201d The Established badge means Guardio has \u201cestablished a consistent positive track record with Google services and compliance with the Developer Program Policy.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s kind of a Google stamp that Guardio is genuine and does exactly what it says.","id":"Is Guardio Safe?","title":"Is Guardio Safe?"},{"answer":"It goes without saying that we are obviously biased, but we genuinely believe the answer is a very firm yes. Consider for a second that Guardio is kind of like a real-time insurance policy. Insurance is something you pay for in case bad stuff happens. In this case, we\u2019re talking about online security - so the bad stuff is getting scammed, phished, downloading dangerous files, or opening malicious websites, and so on. <br\/> But Guardio actually stops the bad stuff from happening in the first place. Imagine if your car insurance actually stopped you from being in an accident. Well, that\u2019s what Guarido does for you when you\u2019re online. It prevents you from getting into trouble. It doesn\u2019t wait for disaster and then asses the damage (which is what regular anti-virus software does, by the way. Guardio is \u201cpreventative\u201d insurance. <br\/> So again, is it worth the money? Absolutely.

Such substantial changes will take effect seven (7) days after such notice was provided on our Website or sent via email. Otherwise, all other changes to these Terms are effective as of the stated “Last Revised” date and your continued use of the Services after the Last Revised date will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.</span></p><strong>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</strong><ol><li><span>Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights by requiring you to arbitrate disputes with Guardio and limits the manner in which you can seek relief. It further provides that you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action. This section of the Terms shall be referred to as the “</span><span>Arbitration Agreement</span><span>.”</span></li><li><span>We will try to work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with our Services, if you bring that issue to the attention of the Guardio team. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a User&#x27;s satisfaction. To the extent permitted under the applicable law, You and Guardio agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or your use of the Services and/or any third parties embedded therein shall be determined by binding arbitration on an individual basis rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</span></li><li><span>Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Guardio are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and any other contractual relationship between you and Guardio.</span></li><li><span>BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION WITH GUARDIO (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATIONS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES), YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST GUARDIO (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SERVICES) ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.</span></li><li><span>If you desire to assert a claim against Guardio, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Guardio, by e-mail, a notice of your claim (&quot;</span><span>Notice</span><span>&quot;). The Notice to Guardio should be addressed to: Legal@guardiosecurity.com (&quot;</span><span>Notice Address</span><span>&quot;) and should state in the “subject line” of the e-mail “LEGAL NOTICE” in all capital letters. If Guardio desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent email address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Guardio, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;</span><span>Demand</span><span>&quot;). If Guardio and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Guardio may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Guardio or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at www.adr.org The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &quot;</span><span>AAA Rules</span><span>&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;</span><span>AAA</span><span>&quot;), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.</span></li><li><span>Unless Guardio and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Guardio agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</span></li><li><span>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “</span><span>Arbitration Fees</span><span>”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Guardio or you under the AAA Rules, Guardio and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Guardio will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Guardio will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</span></li><li><span>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</span></li><li><span>YOU AND GUARDIO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Guardio agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
