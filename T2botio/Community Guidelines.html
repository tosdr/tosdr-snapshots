<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Matrix community, as well
as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring
community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of
conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
<p>This applies to conversation in the any room in the Matrix Space (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:t2bot.io">#community:t2bot.io</a>)
and commits and comments relating to any project in the <a href="https://github.com/t2bot">t2bot</a> Github space.
If &quot;t2bot.io homeserver moderator&quot; (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@abuse:t2bot.io">@abuse:t2bot.io</a>) is a member
of the room, this code of conduct applies to that room as well.</p>
<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming:</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture,
national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate:</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work
of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those
consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we&#39;re a world-wide community, so you
might not be communicating in someone else&#39;s primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It&#39;s important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose:</strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren&#39;t acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree:</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the
time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
that we&#39;re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide
range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to
understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re wrong. Don&#39;t forget that it is
human to err and blaming each other doesn&#39;t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve
issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination,
political or religious affiliation</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person&#39;s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to
food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
<li>Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not
correctly reflect a person&#39;s gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when
not addressing them by their username or handle</li>
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like &quot;hug&quot; or &quot;backrub&quot;)
without consent or after a request to stop</li>
<li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or
to engage in self-harm</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
<li>Stalking or following</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy
with others</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
<li>Deliberate &quot;outing&quot; of any aspect of a person&#39;s identity without their consent except as necessary
to protect others from intentional abuse</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate the conditions of disadvantaged
individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic
origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not discussing
this with you&quot;</li>
<li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>
<li>Communicating in a &#39;tone&#39; you don&#39;t find congenial</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="diversity-statement">Diversity statement</h1>
<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we
will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a
participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been
harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to
right the wrong.</p>
<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender
identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession,
race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate
discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
disabilities.</p>
<h1 id="reporting-issues">Reporting issues</h1>
<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report it
by contacting <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">@travis:t2l.io</a> on Matrix. All reports will be
handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact information (if different from where you sent the report from).</li>
<li>Names (usernames and nicks, real names, and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
are additional witnesses, please include them as well.</li>
<li>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.</li>
<li>The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).</li>
<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>After filing a report you will receive confirmation that we received your report. When we complete
our investigation, we will notify you. The result of the investigation may not be included in the
notification sent to you.</p>
<p>If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from
handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be
handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the
purpose of protecting victims of abuse. For t2bot.io, the Matrix.org Foundation&#39;s Trust &amp; Safety
team acts as the wider response team.</p>
<p>You are also able to report abusive content via your chosen Matrix client, by clicking the event in
question and selecting report. Please note these reports go to your homeserver administrator rather
than us directly. In future, this will change.</p>
<p>We use Mjolnir to handle the moderation of rooms under this Code of Conduct, via the bot
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@abuse:t2bot.io">@abuse:t2bot.io</a>. Please note that pinging this account, or
any other staff accounts, is not the appropriate reporting mechanism. Repeated in-room reports might
result in moderation action.</p>
