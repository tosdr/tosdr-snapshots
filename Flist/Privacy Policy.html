    <p class="paragraph">F-List also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties personally identifiable information. The circumstances under which F-List will disclose such personally identifiable information are when:</p>

    <li>If a third-party bot or service collects other information about the user, such as character names, messages, or other activity logs this information must be disclosed publicly.</li>
    <li>If a third-party bot or service does collect information that is otherwise permitted, it is required to have its own Privacy Policy which discloses what information is collected, how the information is used, and how long the information is retained.</li>
    <li>Ideally, but not mandatory, the third-party bot or service should offer the following:</li>
    <ul class="real-list">
        <li>A manner in which the user may view what information about them is being stored by the bot or service.</li>
        <li>A manner in which the user may opt out of the bot or service and remove their information from said bot or service.</li>
