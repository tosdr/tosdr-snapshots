precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or
control over, your Account: (b) Provide accurate and truthful information;

<h2>9. The Services</h2>
<p dir="auto">9.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things,
provide software that facilitates the submission of Hive blockchain transaction
data to the Hive blockchain without requiring you to access the Hive blockchain
command line interface.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.2. Account and Private Keys. Should you agree to create an Account through
our Service, we generate a cryptographic private and public key pair that
are provided solely to you and completely owned by you; provided however that
we not store passwords or Private Keys for our you. We never have access to
your Private Key and do not custody any Private Keys on your behalf, and
therefore, assume no responsibility for the management of the Private Key
tied to your Account. The Private Key uniquely match the Account name and
must be used in connection with the Account to authorize the transfer of
HIVE and Hive Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for
maintaining the security of your Private Keys. You must keep your Private
Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of
control of HIVE, Hive Power and Hive Dollars associated with your Account.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.3. No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account password
or Private Keys. Your Private Key is your own and you are solely responsible
for their safekeeping. We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval,
reset, or recovery. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account
password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account and password
pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any HIVE,
Hive Dollars and Hive Power you have associated with such Account will become
permanently inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.4.  Transactions. All proposed Hive blockchain transactions must be
confirmed and recorded in the Hive blockchain via the Hive distributed
consensus network (a peer-to-peer network), which is not owned, controlled,
or operated by us. The Hive blockchain is operated by a decentralized network
of independent third parties. We have no control over the Hive blockchain and
therefore cannot and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit
via the Services will be confirmed on the Hive blockchain. You acknowledge
and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not
be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Hive blockchain. You
may use the Services to submit these details to the Hive blockchain.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.5.  No Storage or Transmission of HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power. HIVE,
in any of its forms (HIVE, Hive Dollars and Hive Power) is an intangible,
digital asset controlled by you. These assets exist only by virtue of the
ownership record maintained on the Hive blockchain. The Service does not store,
send, or receive HIVE, Hive Dollars, or Hive Power. Any transfer of title that
might occur in any HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power occurs on the Hive
blockchain and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service
can affect the transfer of title or right in any HIVE, Hive Dollars or
Hive Power.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.6.  Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall create
any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy, or trusteeship, between
you and us.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information
you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and
acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that
you make in connection with any Hive blockchain transaction initiated via
the Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account name or otherwise
provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your
transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been
submitted to the Hive blockchain via the Services, The Services cannot assist
you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. We have no control
over the Hive blockchain and do not have the ability to facilitate any
cancellation or modification requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">9.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply
to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via
the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct
tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the we are not responsible
for determining whether taxes apply to your Hive blockchain transactions or
for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from
any Hive blockchain transactions.</p>
<h2>10. Fees for Using the Services</h2>
<p dir="auto">10.1. Fees Creating an Account. We do not currently charge fees for any
Services in connection with the creation of Accounts, however we reserve the
right to do so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be
displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.</p>
<h2>11. No Right to Cancel And/or Reverse Hive Transactions</h2>
<p dir="auto">11.1. If you use a Service to which HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power is
transacted, you will not be able to change your mind once you have confirmed
that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.</p>
<h2>12. Discontinuation of Services.</h2>
<p dir="auto">12.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without
prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for
storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Account and Private Key that
you maintain in your Account.</p>

Services, you will be may not be able to access HIVE, Hive Dollars and
Hive Power associated with any Account maintained in your Account if we
discontinue or deprecate the Services.</p>

<p dir="auto">13.1. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services in our sole
discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or deactivate
your account and all related information and files in such without cost to you,
including, for instance, if you breach any term of this Agreement. In the
event of termination, your access to the funds in your account will require
you access to the Hive blockchain via the command line API or third party tool,
and will require you to have access to your backup of your Account data
including your Account and Private Keys.</p>
