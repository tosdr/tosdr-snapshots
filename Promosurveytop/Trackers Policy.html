<p>Cookie files can be used to ensure proper display of advertising materials in campaigns of our advertisers and to measure the effectiveness of such campaigns.

<p>A pixel is a line of code which is used by a Website or third party ad server to track a user’s activity.

We do not collect the online user’s personally identifiable information through our pixel tracking tags.</p>
<p>These tags are used by our ads server regarding the user’s behaviour and usage patterns on advertisements and sites operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements users see on various sites and refers only to non-personally identifiable information of users. We believe that the use of these pixel tracking tags enables us and our clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.</p>
