Creating a DeepL account and Signing up for a DeepL Pro Subscription</h2><h3 id="section_6">6.1 Creating a DeepL account </h3><p>You have the option of creating a DeepL account. You can use the DeepL Translator or DeepL Write via this account within the applicable <a href=" https://www.deepl.com/pro-license?tab=free-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DeepL Account Terms and Conditions</a> (please see also section <a href="#section_3" rel="noreferrer">3</a>). To create the account, the following personal data will be stored:</p><ul class=""><li class="mb-4">E-mail address</li><li class="mb-4">Password</li><li class="mb-4">IP address</li></ul><p>We process the email address and password on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR in order to perform the contract of use. Your IP address is processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as it is in our legitimate interests to match your IP address with IP addresses that have misused our service in the past for fraud prevention purposes.  </p><p>Please note that the creation of a DeepL account is a prerequisite for signing up for and using a DeepL Pro subscription (see section <a href="#section_6_2" rel="noreferrer">6.2</a>), but creating a DeepL account does not oblige you to purchase a paid subscription. Even if you do not sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription after creating the account, the DeepL account remains available and you can use it. You can delete your DeepL account at any time by sending an e-mail with your request to support(at)deepl.com.</p><p>If your company uses Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to DeepL, there is no need for a separate registration with DeepL. When you log in via Single Sign-On your company transmits your email address as well as your first and last name directly to us. We also process this data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p><h3 id="section_6">6.2 Signing up for DeepL Pro</h3><p>If, after creating a DeepL account, you sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription, additionally the following personal data will be collected and processed for the purposes of concluding and fulfilling the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR):</p><ul class=""><li class="mb-4">First name, surname, and where applicable, company name</li><li class="mb-4">Address</li><li class="mb-4">Payment details</li><li class="mb-4">Tax numbers (where applicable)</li><li class="mb-4">Selected subscription option</li><li class="mb-4">Possibly other, additional data you provided during the registration process.</li></ul><p>Your payment details will also be processed by us if you initially sign up for a DeepL Pro subscription with a free trial period. Despite the free trial period, the processing of your payment details is already necessary at the time of the formation of the contract within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, as a DeepL Pro subscription is in principle a paid subscription and we only in some cases allow our customers to test our products free of charge for a trial period. However, if no cancellation is made within the aforementioned trial period, the subscription will automatically continue to be subject to payment and the method of payment specified by you will be debited at the time stated in the booking process.</p><p>In order to process payments, we forward the necessary payment data to our authorized payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., Block 4, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, Ireland. Where necessary, Stripe will transfer the data to Stripe, Inc., located in the USA. Further information on data protection at Stripe and compliance with the requirements of Art. 44 GDPR can be found <a href="https://stripe.com/de/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/de/privacy-center/legal#data-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Stripe, which allows Stripe to process the data solely in accordance with our instructions and not for its own purposes.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned data, we process further (usage-)data relevant for the provision and billing of our service, such as subscription ID, date and time of the subscription conclusion, billing period, successful payment processing, logins, number of translated or improved characters and documents, upgrades and downgrades. The processing and storage of the aforementioned data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract as well as its performance and is therefore justified according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. If you yourself are not a party to the contract, but DeepL Pro is provided to you, e.g. by your employer or an organization to which you belong, we justify the processing of the data mentioned in section 6.1 and the aforementioned usage data via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is necessary for the performance of the business relationship with our customers, i.e. your employer or your organization.</p><p>We store the data for the duration of the contract term and subsequently, if applicable, for the duration of statutory retention periods, insofar as these prescribe the retention for the respective types of data. We will delete your account if you wish to do so after canceling your subscription. Otherwise, we will maintain your account as DeepL account (see section <a href="#section_6_1" rel="noreferrer">6.1</a>) so that it is available to you in the event of a renewed subscription without you having to register again. This is in your as well as in our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p><p>In your account in the section “usage”, you can also view data about your usage behavior e.g., - depending on your subscription - the number of characters translated or improved in the past or the number of documents translated. If you have a consumption-based subscription, such as the DeepL API Pro, you can also view the monthly costs incurred. We justify this data processing via Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as it is necessary for the performance of the contract, in particular for billing purposes or for managing the number of documents still available for translation. Insofar as the processing goes beyond what is necessary for the performance of the contract, we base the processing on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as we seek to meet our customers&#x27; wish to visualize information on usage behavior in a transparent manner. The graphical representation of the development of consumption over the contract period is considered to be also in the interest of our customers. </p><p>If you yourself are not a party to the DeepL Pro subscription, but access to our products is provided to you by your employer or an organization to which you belong, it is possible that we share data about your usage of the subscription (e.g. number of translated characters and documents, last login date) with your employer or organization on request. Providing this data corresponds to our legitimate interests as well as the legitimate interests of our customers in receiving information about the use of the subscriptions they have paid for.</p><h3 id="section_6">6.3 Processing of the Submitted Texts and Translations / Improvements</h3><p>We process the texts you submit to DeepL Pro and their translations or improvements only temporarily, insofar as this is necessary for the creation and transmission of the translation or improvement. The processing is therefore justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. Your texts and the translations or improvements will - within the framework of the contractual agreements and as stated in section <a href="#section_4" rel="noreferrer">4</a> and <a href="#section_5" rel="noreferrer">5</a> - not be stored permanently and will be deleted after the performance of the contractually owed service. The only exception is if you use the &quot;saved translations&quot; feature. In this case, texts selected by you, including translations, can be saved on DeepL servers and thus kept accessible at all times. When you use the “saved translations” feature in our apps, your texts and translations are stored locally. </p><p>If you use our glossary feature and store certain term pairs there, this data will be forwarded to our servers and stored for your account. If you want to use the glossary function as part of our service, the data processing that takes place in this context is necessary for the performance of our contract and is therefore also justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p></div></div><div class="legalFrameworkSection-module--legalFrameworkSection--6e74a"><div class="richText-module--customRichTextContainer--5328f"><h2 id="section_7">7.

The storage of the full IP address for the users of the DeepL free version for a maximum period of 14 days is also justified by our legitimate interest in achieving the listed purposes, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. The storage of IP addresses of users of the paid DeepL Pro subscription for the duration of the contract is justified by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p><p>Our website also uses services of Cloudflare, Inc, 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (&quot;Cloudflare&quot;), which operates a so-called Content Delivery Network (CDN). To protect our website, the data transfer between your browser and our servers is routed through Cloudflare&#x27;s infrastructure in order to analyze whether it is an abusive attack. As part of this analysis, your data is transmitted to Cloudflare in encrypted form, if necessary also to Cloudflare servers in the USA. However, since your requests and other customer data are encrypted between your end device and the DeepL servers, Cloudflare does not have any access to this data, but only to meta-data (such as your IP address). Only static resources (such as graphics) are loaded directly from Cloudflare-servers. In addition, Cloudflare determines a so-called bot score immediately before the login to DeepL, which is based on the analysis of the metadata of the client (browser) used. The use of Cloudflare is in our legitimate interest to secure the use of our website and to prevent and defend harmful attacks from outside, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Cloudflare and Cloudflare may therefore only process the data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes.

The user will be informed of this before using the speech-to-text function for the first time and asked to give their consent.

Your personal data will not be collected or processed throughout the entire process. We won’t ask you to enter any personal data when taking part in the survey. Furthermore, to collect your product interaction data we don’t collect or process your IP-address. In order to obtain this data from you, we will assign you a user ID upon confirmation that you wish to participate in the survey. This user ID – in the form of a cookie – does not give away any personal data about the person behind the interaction data and is therefore anonymised.   </p><p>Your survey results and product interaction data (if any) will be stored and processed collectively by DeepL for up to 2 years.   </p><p>If personal data is nevertheless collected or processed in the aforementioned process - which we do not plan or assume from our side - we justify this via Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this represents the least intrusion into the rights of the user in contrast to an opt-in and corresponds to the principle of data minimisation. You may withdraw your consent for the cookie at any time with effect for the future by deleting your browser cache. </p><h3 id="section_15">15.2 Customer Surveys</h3><p>We want to encourage customers to share their experiences with using our products.

As operator of the pages, we also have the option of viewing anonymous statistics on the interaction of visitors with our pages (insight function). For this purpose, the operators of the social networks record your interactions with our pages using cookies and similar technologies. You can find more information on this kind of data processing by Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/788388387972460?helpref=faq_content&amp;cms_id=788388387972460&amp;published_only=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a427660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>The legal basis for the operation of our social media profiles and the insights function is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in using the pages as an information channel for our company.

Insofar as your consent given to the social network justifies the data processing within the framework of the respective social platform, processing is carried out on the basis of this consent.</p><p>In addition, we use the LinkedIn image pixel to record and evaluate conversions from our LinkedIn advertising campaigns. Conversions mean whether a user is successfully led to our website via our LinkedIn advertising campaign. Furthermore, user interactions - i.e., individual steps taken by the user on our website - are to be recorded and tracked via conversions. The LinkedIn image pixel is embedded on certain pages of our website and provides feedback to LinkedIn if a conversion has taken place. In doing so, LinkedIn processes the user’s IP address as well as the presence of a cookie set by LinkedIn, which provides conclusions about the conversion. The processing of your personal data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR). The consent is given via the cookie settings. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future by revoking the consent for the “Marketing” cookie category or deleting your browser cache.</p><p>Please note that we together with the operator of the respective social network are jointly responsible for the data processing operations triggered when you visit our page.

Webinars</h2><p>We offer webinars for our users and existing or prospective customers. The webinars are interactive events on the products we offer, conducted by our staff. External speakers may also be invited to the webinars. We point this out accordingly before registration. </p><p>We use a service provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (&quot;Zoom&quot;), 55 Almaden Blvd. Suite 600, San Jose, CA 95113, USA, on whose platform the webinars are held. Registration for our webinars takes place via a corresponding landing page of Zoom. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Zoom and Zoom may only process personal data according to our instructions and not for its own purposes. We would like to point out that if you access Zoom&#x27;s website, Zoom is responsible for the personal data processed through your use of the website. If you have entered into a contractual relationship with Zoom, we have no influence on the personal data collected and processed in this context as part of our webinars. Further information on the handling of personal data at Zoom - in particular also in relation to webinars - can be found <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>In the event of registration for a webinar on a landing page provided by Zoom, we collect and process all personal data that you provide when registering for one of our webinars (first and last name, email address, company (optional), position (optional)). We process your data to fulfil the free participation contract concluded between you and us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. We store your data on this basis for the duration of the existence of our contractual relationship, i.e. until the conclusion of the webinar, and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods where this is required. If you have a DeepL account and it is possible for us to assign the webinar registration to this account, the processing of your personal data in the context of our customer database and the analyses of our customer-related processes until the end of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to record the demand for webinars and in this context to improve the services for our customers. After completion of the webinar, we note in our customer database under your account that you participated in the webinar. The name and e-mail address given during registration will not be noted and - if they do not match the details in the DeepL account created - will be deleted by us after the webinar has ended. Should personal data be processed at all in this note in the customer database beyond the webinar, we base this on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as this is in our legitimate interest to specifically identify whether customers understand our products in order to provide them with support more quickly in individual cases, or in order to provide certain customers with extended webinars and training. </p><p>When participating in a webinar and using Zoom, the following additional personal data is processed:</p><ul class=""><li class="mb-4">User information (This is data associated with the Zoom account and its authentication, e.g. first name, last name, display name, email address, password (unless Single Sign On (SSO) is used), profile picture, Zoom unique user ID);</li><li class="mb-4">Communication data (This is data that you independently enter, upload or share as part of the webinar and associated Zoom usage);</li><li class="mb-4">Meeting metadata and telemetry data (This technical data is, among other things, data relating to the use of the service, including when and how sessions were conducted (IP address, event logs, session information, etc.), as well as device and hardware information that Zoom needs to access in order for features such as camera, microphone, etc. to be operational in the context of participation).</li></ul><p>Please note that it is also possible to participate in the webinar without having a Zoom account. In this case, the collection and processing of data is limited to the minimum necessary to be able to maintain the service for you. We have chosen settings so that the collection and processing of the communication content generally takes place on servers in the European Union. As Zoom is based in the USA, we cannot exclude the possibility that data processing (in particular meeting metadata) may also take place in the USA when using the service. A collection and processing of your data through the use of Zoom takes place on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR (participation contract). We store the data collected and processed by Zoom on our behalf for the duration of the Zoom webinar and subsequently for the duration of the statutory retention periods, if this is required. We have no influence on the duration of the data processed by Zoom under its own responsibility. Please contact Zoom directly for information in this regard.</p><p>Automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR does not take place.</p><p>Please note that we may record Zoom webinars and publish them afterwards on our website or social media channels. Participants will not be visible or identifiable in these recordings. As participants can only ask written questions, they will not appear visually in the recording. The answer to the participant&#x27;s question will be part of the webinar recording. If, contrary to expectations, personal data of the participants is visible during the recording, it will be made unrecognisable before publication.  The recording and storage of the webinar is based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR, as these processing operations are in our legitimate interest to improve the quality of our webinars. When the webinars are published, no further processing of personal data will take place, as we will make them unrecognisable beforehand - if they can be viewed at all.</p></div></div><div class="legalFrameworkSection-module--legalFrameworkSection--6e74a"><div class="richText-module--customRichTextContainer--5328f"><h2 id="section_18">18.
