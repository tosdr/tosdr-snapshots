                    <!-- <p>You cannot currently download sounds, but if you would like sound files for your project, please <a href="/pages/contact">contact us</a> and let us know which sound you would like.</p> -->
                    
                    <p>To download a sound, right click on the sound and press 'download sound'. You can get free download credits by waching an advert.</p>

                    <!-- <p>Skipping the advert may prevent receiving your free download credits. These adverts help fund this free site. It wouldn't exist otherwise. This site makes lots of people happy.

                    <h5>Why are there adverts?</h5>
                        <p>Advertising helps support this free site. It costs money in hosting, and a lot of time and effort making and maintaining the site.</p>

                        <p>We've tried many different ways over the years to fund this site, including charging for downloads, donations, selling merchandise and stickers, but there was little to no support.</p>

                    <h5>Why soundboards?</h5>
                    <p>Read about the unexpected benefits of soundboards on the <a href="/pages/have-fun-playing-sounds">Have Fun Playing Sounds</a> page.</p>

                    <h5>Can I use my keyboard to play sounds?></h5>
                    <p>Yes! You can use the keyboard to play sounds. Just press the key that corresponds to the sound you want to play. You can see the key on the top left of sound buttons.</p>

                    <h5>How can I create a soundboard?</h5>
                    <p>To make a soundboard, create an account, go to <a href="/home">My Soundboards</a>, press 'Add New Board,' name your board, then upload sound files. Press 'Request Transcription' and within a few minutes your sounds will be automatically labelled using Speech to Text, or label them yourself.</p>

                    <h5>How do I edit sound files?</h5>
                    <p>These are three ways you can edit sound files:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use the free software '<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>' (recommended) which you can <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/" target="_blank">download for free</a>, to edit your files before you upload them.</li>
                        <li>Use the <a href="https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/editor">online audio editor</a> to edit your files before you upload them.</li>
                        <li>Trim your sounds after you upload them by pressing the <span class="fas fa-scissors" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon next to the sound on your soundboard.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Can I make my own Favorites soundboard and share it with my friends?</h5>
                    <p>Yes you can. Sign up or log in to your account. Right-click any sound on any soundboard and press 'Add to Favorites.' Then find your public favorites soundboard on the <a href="/favorites">favorites soundboards list</a>. The newest ones are at the end of the list.</p>

                    <h5>What file format do my sounds need to be?</h5>
                    <p>You can upload files in any format, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MKV and MP4. They will be automatically converted.</p>

                    <h5>What is Text-to-Speech?</h5>
                    <p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into spoken voice output. It is used in a variety of applications, including voice assistants, navigation systems, and accessibility tools for people with visual impairments. On 101soundboards you can use TTS to create custom sounds in the voices of celebrities, streamers, cartoon characters and more, then share them with others.</p>

                    <h5>How does the TTS feature work on this site?</h5>
                    <p>When you submit a phrase to be converted into speech, our system sends the text to a TTS engine, which generates an audio file of the spoken text. The audio file is then added to the soundboard for you to play and share with others.</p>
                    <p>To use the TTS feature, simply enter your desired phrase in the text box on the voice of your choice. Click the "Generate" button to create your custom sound. The TTS engine will process your request and generate an audio file of the spoken text, which will be added to the top of the soundboard in green for you to play and share with others.</p>
                    <p>You can find a list of available voices and song generators on the <a href="/boards/tts">TTS page</a>. Explore a variety of voices and create unique sounds to share with your friends.</p>

                    <h5>Why does it take time for my TTS request to be processed?</h5>
                    <p>The time it takes for your TTS request to be processed depends on the current queue size and the TTS engine being used. Some voices have no queue and are processed immediately, while others may take a few minutes to generate the audio file.</p>

                    <h5>What should I do while waiting for my TTS request to be processed?</h5>
                    <p>If there is a queue, while waiting for your TTS request to be processed you can bookmark the page and check back later. You can also explore other voices and song generators on the site to create more sounds, or explore the millions of sounds already available on 101soundboards.</p>

                    <h5>Can I queue multiple sounds for generation at the same time?</h5>
                    <p>Yes, you can queue multiple sounds for generation at the same time. Each sound will be processed in the order it was submitted, and you can check the status of each request on the soundboard.</p>

                    <h5>What happens if my TTS request contains inappropriate content?</h5>
                    <p>Phrases with extreme inappropriate language, hate speech, self-harm, violence, or bullying may be blocked and not displayed on the soundboard. Please keep your requests fun, friendly, and respectful.</p>

                    <h5>How do I delete a TTS sound I created?</h5>
                    <p>To delete a TTS sound you created, right click on the sound (press and hold on mobile) and select "Report" from the context menu. The sound will typically be removed from the soundboard within a few minutes.</p>

                    <h5>Where can I find more voices and song generators?</h5>
                    <p>You can find more voices and song generators on the <a href="/boards/tts">TTS Voices List</a>. Explore a variety of voices and create unique sounds to share with your friends.</p>

                    <h5>Why did another similar sound get generated?</h5>
                    <p>Sometimes we use AI to generate a phrase in the style of the character or voice you requested. This is a bonus and can be fun to explore.</p>

                    <h5>How can I learn more about the TTS feature?</h5>
                    <p>If you have more questions about the TTS feature or need help with a specific request, please contact us through the <a href="/pages/contact">contact page</a>. We are here to help you create awesome sounds!</p>

                    <h5>Can I create my own TTS voice from a custom recording?</h5>
                    <p>While we would love to offer custom TTS voices from custom recordings, this feature is not currently available on the site due to the prohibitive cost. However, we are always looking for ways to improve the TTS feature and add new voices and features. If you have a suggestion or request, please contact us through the <a href="/pages/contact">contact page</a>. We appreciate your feedback!</p>

                    <h5>Can I suggest new voices or features for the TTS feature?</h5>

                    <h5>Downloading a sound with the app failed</h5>
                    <p>Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. There are frequent updates, and it is the easiest way to clear your cache and reset the app. Alternatively you can just download the sound from the web site.</p>

                    <h5>I want to play lots of sounds at the same time</h5>
                    <p>At the footer of the page, there is a button that can be switched between '1-Shot' and 'Multiplay' modes. 'Multiplay' plays multiple sounds at the same time, and 'One Shot' will stop the previous sound when you play a new one.</p>

                    <h5>Can I install 101soundboards?</h1>

                    <h5>Why are the sounds different colors?</h5>

                    <h5>How do I hide the adverts when downloading?</h5>

            <h5>hCaptcha</h5>
            <p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our websites or mobile apps. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/ and https://hcaptcha.com/terms.</p>
