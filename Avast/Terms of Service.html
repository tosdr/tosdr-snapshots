                <p>Vendor may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of any affected Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement.

<p id="solution-4">2.4. YOUR USE OF THE SOLUTION OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY SECTION 2 OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY RESALE OR FURTHER DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOLUTION, CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY VIOLATE APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAWS.</p>
              	<h3 id="auto-renewval">2A. Auto-renewal</h3>
               	<p>This Section 2A sets out some important provisions relating to the way your auto-renewing subscription functions. Further important provisions (such as your ‘right of withdrawal’) are set out in the terms made available by the entity from which you purchased the Solution (“<i>Distributor</i>”) and accepted by you as governing your subscription.</p>
              <p>2A.1 Your subscription will automatically renew, and you will be notified in advance of the renewal. Please note that the renewal price may be different to the price you paid for the existing Subscription Period, and the notification in advance of the renewal will include how much the subsequent Subscription Period will cost, when you will be charged and how long the subsequent Subscription Period will last.</p>
              <p>2A.2 Unless otherwise cancelled, the Distributor will attempt to take payment from you (using your saved credit card or bank account details), for the subsequent Subscription Period, up to thirty five (35) days in advance of the renewal date.</p>
              <p>2A.3 To the extent payment is unable to be taken on the first attempt, the Distributor will make further attempts to take payment up to 15 days after the renewal date and you may be contacted to update your payment details.</p>
              <p>2A.4 Upon automatic renewal of your subscription, you will receive a confirmation email which shall include all the key information in respect of your automatic renewal and the duration of the subsequent Subscription Period.</p>
              <p>2A.5 You are entitled to switch-off the auto-renewal of your subscription using the process notified to you during the order process for the subscription, meaning that your subscription will come to an end when the then current Subscription Period expires. Once you have elected to cancel the auto-renewal of your subscription, auto-renewal will remain cancelled unless you subsequently agree to a new subscription.</p>
              <p>2A.6 If your subscription auto-renews, you may cancel that renewal no later than 30 days following such renewal date. If the Distributor has taken payment for the next Subscription Period (“<i>Renewal Payment</i>”) then you will receive a full refund of the Renewal Payment.</p>
                <h2 id="updates">3. Updates</h2>
                
<p>Vendor, from time to time during the Subscription Period and without your separate permission or consent, may from time to time deploy an upgrade or update of, or replacement for, any Solution (“<i>Update</i>”), and as a result of any such deployment you may not be able to use the applicable Solution or Device (or certain functions of the Device) until any such Update is fully installed or activated. Each Update will be deemed to form a part of the “Solution” for all purposes under this Agreement. Updates may include both additions to, and removal of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion. Vendor is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay Updates but, in any event, you may need to download and permit installation or activation of all available Updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. Vendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed or activated all Updates. Vendor in its sole discretion will determine when and if Updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any Updates available to you. Vendor in its sole discretion may stop providing Updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or Updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.</p>

				<h2 id="government-rights">9. U.S. government restricted rights</h2>
				<p id="government-rights-1">All Solutions qualify as “commercial items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.

This Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> applies to any Dispute arising from or related to any Solution, subscription for any Solution or this Agreement, and involving you and Vendor. “Dispute”, for the purposes of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a>, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis, claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation or fraud, indemnification, tort (including negligence and strict product liability), and violation of statute or regulation).</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-2">11.2. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide Vendor with a notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of your name, address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested by you. You must send any notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal.department@gendigital.com (stating Subject: Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> Notice of Dispute Under EULA).</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-3">
11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-4"> 11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“<i>FAA</i>”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles). Except as provided in Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement-5" class="link-primary">11.5</a> below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-5">
11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> is subject to the following exceptions:</p>

<p>11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</p>

<p>11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.</p>

<p>11.5.3. If you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the “<i>ODR Platform</i>”). The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" class="link-primary">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-6">11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “<i>AAA</i>”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “<i>Consumer Procedures</i>”) and will be subject to the following:</p>

<p>11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>

<p>11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.</p>

<p>11.6.3. You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.</p>

<p>11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a> and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.</p>
				<p id="arbitration-agreement-7">11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section <a href="#arbitration-agreement" class="link-primary">11</a>, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<i>Commercial Procedures</i>”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.</p>

				<p id="general-8"> 12.8. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist upon the strict performance of any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance with this Agreement, and the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement on the part of either party shall be effective for any purpose whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and signed by such party. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of other breaches of the same or of other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
				<p id="general-9">12.9. Assignment. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Vendor. Vendor may assign this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion without any prior written consent by you.</p>
				<p general-10> 
12.10. No Third Party Beneficiaries.

<p>(a) “<i>Content</i>” means any content, materials, products and services that you may access on or through the MTIP, including Vendor Content, Your Content and information you may exchange with other MTIP users.</p>

<p>(b) “<i>MTIP</i>” means the Mobile Threat Intelligence Platform made available by Avast.</p>

<p>(c) “<i>Threat Sample</i>” means any code, feature, routine or device that contains, describes or demonstrates any element of Malicious Code.</p>

<p>(d) “<i>Vendor Content</i>” means all Content that members of the Vendor Group upload, publish, display or make available to others by using the MTIP, and all Content that is published, displayed, distributed or made available by other parties using the MTIP, but excluding Your Content and Threat Samples.</p>

<p>(e) “<i>Your Content</i>” means all Content (excluding any Threat Samples), materials, products and services that you upload, publish, display, distribute or make available to others by using the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.2. Vendor Content, as between you and the Vendor Group, is the property of the members of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use and access Vendor Content as made available to you on the MTIP solely in connection with your use of the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.3. The availability of any Content on the MTIP does not amount to an endorsement or verification of such content by any member of the Vendor Group. Members of the Vendor Group make no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP. Members of the Vendor Group are not providing any advice or recommendations to you by making Content available on the MTIP (including in respect of Vendor Content) and, accordingly, you must form your own judgments and decisions based upon your own due diligence and investigations, and must not place any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content made available on the MTIP.</p>

<p>13.16.4. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you grant members of the Vendor Group a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, and otherwise use Your Content in connection with the operation or use of the MTIP or the promotion, advertising or marketing of the MTIP, in any and all media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others (now known or later developed). You agree that this license includes the right for members of the Vendor Group to make Your Content available to Vendor Partners who collaborate with members of the Vendor Group for the uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content through other media or distribution methods or modes of making the MTIP or Content available to others. This license also includes the right for other users of the MTIP to use and modify Your Content. You understand that we may modify, adapt, or create derivative works from Your Content in order to upload, publish, display, distribute or make it available over computer networks, devices, service providers, and in various media. We may also remove or refuse to publish Your Content on the MTIP, in whole or part, at any time in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>13.16.5. By uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP, you represent, warrant and undertake to each member of the Vendor Group that: (a) you have the ownership rights, or you have obtained all necessary rights licenses or permissions from any relevant parties, to use Your Content and to grant members of the Vendor Group all necessary rights, licenses and permissions to use Your Content as provided for under this Agreement; and (b) that uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party or member of the Vendor Group, violate the privacy or other personal rights of others, or violate applicable law. You accept full responsibility for avoiding infringement of the intellectual property, violation of the privacy or other personal rights of others or violation of applicable law in connection with Your Content. You agree to pay all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed to any person by reason of you uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making available Your Content on the MTIP or members of the Vendor Group or Vendor Partners exercising any of the rights, licenses and permissions you have granted under this Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a>.</p>

<p>13.16.6. No member of the Vendor Group makes any representation, warranty or undertaking regarding Threat Samples, and the Vendor Group disclaims any warranty (whether express or implied) that the reproduction, distribution or use of any Threat Sample does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, violate the privacy or other personal rights of others, or violate applicable law. If you use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, upload, publish, transmit, store, display, distribute, make available to others, or otherwise use any Threat Sample, you assume all associated risks, and irrevocably waive all rights to bring a claim against any member of the Vendor Group in connection with such Threat Sample.</p>

<p>13.16.7. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections <a href="#ownership" class="link-primary">4</a>, <a href="#restrictions-1.7" class="link-primary">5.1.7</a>, <a href="#restrictions-1.11" class="link-primary">5.1.11</a> and <a href="#restrictions-3" class="link-primary">5.3</a> (“<i>Pertinent Sections</i>”) shall be applicable to Your Content and your use of the MTIP (including uploading, publishing, displaying, distributing or making Your Content available on the MTIP). This Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a> and the Pertinent Sections, to the greatest extent practicable, will be construed to be consistent with each other, but in the event of a conflict they will govern in the following order of precedence: (i) this Section <a href="#special-terms-16" class="link-primary">13.16</a>; and (ii) the Pertinent Sections.</p>
