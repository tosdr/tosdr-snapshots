Information about third party service providers utilized by GoGuardian Offerings is available <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64fb1ecdb172d34a9b9f0cd5/660328cbc7560ff19ce93e07_GoGuardian%20List%20of%20Third%20Party%20Service%20Partners.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

For example, we may use aggregate, anonymous data to publish an e-Book on Schools’ most utilized online educational resources.</li></ul><p>If you are a School or other Authorized School Personnel in the EEA or the UK, please see our Notice to EEA and Other Non-US Residents below.</p><h2>5. How Long We Keep Information</h2><p>We retain Personal Student Information as directed by the School:</p><ul role="list"><li><em>School’s Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information: </em>We act upon a School’s documented instructions to delete Personal Student Information during and after all School licenses to the Offerings have expired, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. Upon instruction to delete Personal Student Information, we will take reasonable efforts to delete and/or de-identify such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws. At the termination of all of the School’s licenses with us, we and the School may agree to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information back to the School. In that case, similar to deletion requests, we will act upon a School’s documented instruction to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information to the School and take reasonable efforts to transfer such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations, or with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. For Schools in the EEA, Personal Student Information will be deleted and transferred/ported according to the terms of the DPA or other agreement between the School and us.</li><li><em>Video Conferencing Recordings:</em> If a School enables the video conferencing feature in GoGuardian Teacher, audio and video recordings will be stored by GoGuardian for ninety (90) days.

At that time, if a School has not requested deletion of Personal Student Information, we will automatically de-identify and/or delete the School’s Personal Student Information within a commercially reasonable period of time as long as that information is not necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. All Personal Student Information retained will remain subject to our Product Privacy Policy that was in effect at that time — even after the deactivation of an account or termination of a contract.</li></ul><p>We generally retain information other than Personal Student Information for as long as it may be relevant to the purposes above or as required or permitted by law. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  The purposes for which we use information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate de-identifying steps. Please note that information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.</p><h2>6.

You can read more about any such applicable rights at our <a href="https://www.peardeck.com/policies/privacy-policy-for-website-visitors">Privacy Policy for Website visitors</a>.

We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to continue processing an individual’s information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request that an individual and/or School provide us with information necessary to confirm the individual’s identity before responding to your request. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@goguardian.com. Authorized agents for California residents may submit requests at: <a href="https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests?__hstc=4451244.0d456da7e863253ebfb2300d52614dad.1673026256264.1699567208945.1699570364598.35&amp;__hssc=4451244.8.1699570364598&amp;__hsfp=3599258620" target="_blank">https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests</a>.   In addition to those rights, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.

If our Offerings do not cover the scope of the transfer request, we will, following documented instructions from the School, honor the requests from the parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or Authorized School Personnel for the transfer of Personal Student Information or personal data of the Authorized School Personnel by utilizing the same guidelines as described above in “Review, Correction, and Deletion Requests” in compliance with and as required by relevant law.<br/><br/>‍<em>Transfer Requests for Student-Generated Content. </em>California law requires website operators to transfer student-generated content to the student’s personal account when requested by an eligible student, parent, or guardian. The Offerings are not used as the primary platform for students to submit their own content. To the extent that students in California, or in other states with similar transfer laws, submit their content on the Offerings, the appropriate parent, guardian, or eligible student may submit a request to privacy@goguardian.com to transfer this information to him/her. Following verification of the requestor’s authorization to receive the information (which may require verification by the requestor’s School), we will provide the student-generated content that we have in a commercially reasonable amount of time in either a CSV or other mutually-agreeable format. Please note that we cannot guarantee retention of student-generated content.</p><h2>7. How We Protect Your Information</h2><p>We take the security and privacy of your School’s data very seriously. For these reasons, we have implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information, including specific training of our personnel authorized to access Personal Student Information and other information.

Notice to E.E.A. and Other Non-U.S. Residents</h2><p>European Union (“EU”) data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as &quot;data controllers&quot;) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as &quot;data processors&quot;). Depending on the particular circumstance, we and your School may act either as a data controller or a data processor of your personal data. The laws in some jurisdictions like the EU also require data controllers to share the legal ground that they rely upon to use or disclose personal information.</p><h3>8.1 Liminex as a Data Controller vs. Data Processor</h3><p>Liminex is considered the “processor” of School Information (except for School Profile Information), Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information. We collect, use, share and disclose this information as a processor on behalf of and at the instruction of the School controller, pursuant to <a href="https://www.peardeck.com/policies/product-terms-and-end-user-license-agreement">our EULA</a> and, if applicable, <a href="https://www.peardeck.com/policies/data-processing-addendum">DPA</a>.
