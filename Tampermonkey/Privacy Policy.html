  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p id="toc" class="toc"></p>

  <h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>Note: <em>This translation is shown for your convenience only. The German version, which you can find <a href="/privacy.php?locale=de">here</a>, is legally binding.</em></p>
<p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the company Jan Biniok.
The use of the Internet pages of the company Jan Biniok is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.
If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the company Jan Biniok. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope,
and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>As the controller, the company Jan Biniok has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>The data protection declaration of the company Jan Biniok is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>
<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a) Personal data</strong>
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&quot;data subject&quot;).
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>b) Data subject</strong>
Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>c) Processing</strong>
Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>d) Restriction of processing</strong>
Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>e) Profiling</strong>
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person&#39;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>f) Pseudonymisation</strong>
Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</strong>
Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>h) Processor</strong>
Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>i) Recipient</strong>
Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.
However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>j) Third party</strong>
Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>k) Consent</strong>
Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject&#39;s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="name-and-address-of-the-controller">Name and Address of the controller</h2>
<p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
<p>The Internet pages of the company Jan Biniok use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the company Jan Biniok can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.
The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user&#39;s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>
<h2 id="collection-of-general-data-and-information">Collection of general data and information</h2>
<p>The website of the company Jan Biniok collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files.
Collected may be
  (1) the browser types and versions used,
  (2) the operating system used by the accessing system,
  (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
  (4) the sub-websites,
  (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
  (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address),
  (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and
  (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
<p>  When using these general data and information, the company Jan Biniok does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
  Rather, this information is needed to
    (1) deliver the content of our website correctly,
    (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement,
    (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and
    (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
      Therefore, the company Jan Biniok analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
      The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
<h2 id="registration-on-our-website">Registration on our website</h2>
<p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.
The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address - assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject - date, and time of the registration are also stored.
The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p>
<h2 id="contact-possibility-via-the-website">Contact possibility via the website</h2>
<p>The website of the company Jan Biniok contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).
If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.
Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p>
<h2 id="tampermonkey-extensions-and-apps">Tampermonkey extensions and apps</h2>
<p>The Tampermonkey extensions and apps are capturing anonymous usage information, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current version of the extension</li>
<li>preferred language</li>
<li>script installations for backlist updates</li>
<li>browser and operating system type</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore an error report is automatically sent to a self-hosted Matomo installation whenever an internal error occurs.
The report contains some of the anonymous information stated previously along with the current extension version and a description of the error.
You can prevent this information from being generated and sent by adjusting the settings on the browser extension accordingly.
Please disable the &quot;Anonymous statistics&quot; setting to do so.</p>
<p>Note: in incognito mode anonymous usage information is neither captured nor sent if technically possible (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/incognito">&quot;split&quot; mode</a> browser support).</p>
<p>For technical reasons sometimes (i.e. when Tampermonkey checks for black list updates) data as stated at <a href="#general-data">point 5</a> is collected.
You can disable this collection by adjusting the &quot;Script Blacklist Source&quot; and &quot;Show TM update notification&quot; setting.</p>
<h2 id="routine-erasure-and-blocking-of-personal-data">Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h2>
<p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</li>
<li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>
<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
<li><em>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the company Jan Biniok, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.

<h2 id="data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-google-adsense">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense</h2>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense. Google AdSense is an online service which allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites.
Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the content of the respective third-party site.
Google AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of generating individual user profiles.
The operating company of Google&#39;s AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States
The purpose of Google&#39;s AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website.
Google AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Alphabet Inc. is enabled to analyze the use of our website.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will
automatically submit data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>
<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Additionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc. may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed.
Based on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc. is able to determine if and when a website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject. Tracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website
Through Google AdSense, personal data and information—which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements—is transmitted to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America.
These personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America. The Alphabet Inc. may disclose the collected personal data through this technical procedure to third parties.</p>

<p>On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network.
Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google&#39;s search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result.
In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords.</p>
<p>The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES
The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website
If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above.
A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.
The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through.</p>
<p>AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.
The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link <a href="http://www.google.de/settings/ads">www.google.de/settings/ads</a> and set the desired settings.</p>

During the course of this technical procedure, YouTube and Google gain knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in on YouTube, YouTube recognizes with each call-up to a sub-page that contains a YouTube video, which specific sub-page of our Internet site was visited by the data subject.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.</p>
<p>YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a call-up to our website is made.

<h2 id="legal-basis-for-the-processing">Legal basis for the processing</h2>
<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.</p>
<p>Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.</p>
<p>Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR.
This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR)</p>
<h2 id="the-legitimate-interests-pursued-by-the-controller-or-by-a-third-party">The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h2>
<p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of the company Jan Biniok including all our employees.</p>
<h2 id="period-for-which-the-personal-data-will-be-stored">Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>
<h2 id="provision-of-personal-data-as-statutory-or-contractual-requirement-requirement-necessary-to-enter-into-a-contract-obligation-of-the-data-subject-to-provide-the-personal-data-possible-consequences-of-failure-to-provide-such-data">Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data</h2>
<p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer.
Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</p>
<h2 id="existence-of-automated-decision-making">Existence of automated decision-making</h2>
