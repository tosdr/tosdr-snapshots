be strictly limited to a single Rose Web Services Account per PayPal account. Virtual credit cards and gift cards typically will not be accepted. Other forms of payment are not
available. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for paid Services are deemed part of this Agreement.<br><br> 5.2 We use
third-party payment processors (the "Payment Processors") to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for use of the paid
Services. The processing of payments may be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processors in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for
errors by the Payment Processors. By choosing to use paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processors, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such
paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processors, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method").
You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.<br><br> BILLING AND TERMS<br> 5.3 The term of this Agreement shall be monthly or yearly, depending of your chosen
preference during the checkout process, to commence on the date that the Subscriber signs up electronically for the Services by creating an Account with an email address. All
invoices are denominated, and Subscriber must pay, in U.S. Dollars. There is no term for the single incident support services. Single incident support services are invoiced and billed
one time in advance. All payments for single incident support services have to be received before any Service can start.
Subscribers are typically billed monthly on the first day of each month if paying monthly, or on the first day of the annual billing period when the annual payment is due, with
payment due no later than seven (7) days past the invoice date. We will retry the charges several times during the 7 days past the invoice date, and will send you an email whenever
such attempt has been unsuccessful. We will also send you multiple email reminders and warnings before your Service is suspended. All Subscribers with unpaid invoice(s) 7 days after
the invoice due date will have their Service suspended, pending full payment of their balance. Subscribers with unpaid invoice(s) 30 days after the due date will have their
Service(s) completely terminated and deleted. Subscribers are entirely responsible for the payment of all taxes, if any. Monthly fees and renewal fees will be billed at the rate agreed to at purchase. You may cancel
the Services at any time by logging into the client area at <a href="https://my.linuxhostsupport.com/index.php?/clientarea/">https://my.linuxhostsupport.com/index.php?/clientarea/</a>. At cancellation,
your Service is terminated and it is no longer available. Except in the case of subscription commitments you have agreed to, which shall be nonrefundable, as permitted by law, if you cancel, you agree that fees for the first month of Services and any start-up
costs associated with setting up your Account ("Start-up Costs") shall be nonrefundable, as permitted by law. With the exception of any subscription commitments agreed by you, if
you paid fees in advance for any period longer than one month, then you may, with the exception of fees for the first month of Services and any Start-up Costs, obtain a refund on a
pro rata basis for the period remaining after you cancel.<br><br> 5.4 Some of the paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by
recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept
responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE
(RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE
REASONABLY COULD ACT.<br><br> 5.5 YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT
CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSORS
IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME
OR PASSWORD. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU
HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.<br><br>

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>
13.1 Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you and Rose Web Services agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: in the event of any controversy,
claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to: (i) the Website; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Services; (iv) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this
Agreement; or (v) any other dispute between you and Rose Web Services ("Dispute"), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing
written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the
receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent (1) if to Rose Web Services LLC, 2977 Hwy K STE 252, Ofallon, MO 63368, USA or (2) if to
you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your Account information. Both you and Rose Web Services agree that this dispute resolution
procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Arbitration Agreement And Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p>
14.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Rose Web Services in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Rose Web Services agree
that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND
AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ROSE WEB SERVICES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br><br> 14.2 Despite the
provisions of Section 14.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims
court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv)
to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br><br> 14.3 Any arbitration between you and Rose Web Services will be settled under the
Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by
calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Rose Web Services.<br><br> 14.4 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
("Notice"). Rose Web Services' address for Notice is: Rose Web Services LLC, 2977 Hwy K STE 252, Ofallon, MO 63368, USA. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the
claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an
agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Rose Web Services LLC may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
settlement offer made by you or Rose Web Services must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is
finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Rose Web Services will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last
written settlement amount offered by Rose Web Services in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.<br><br> 14.5 If you commence arbitration in
accordance with these Terms, Rose Web Services will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any
fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in St. Louis, Missouri, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you
may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or
(iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or
the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment
of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Rose Web Services for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to
pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br><br> 14.6 YOU AND ROSE WEB SERVICES
AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Rose Web Services agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
form of a representative or class proceeding.<br><br> 14.7 If Rose Web Services makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Rose Web Services'
address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Rose Web Services' address for Notice, in which case your account with
Rose Web Services will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br><br> 14.8 If Section
14.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in that case,
the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. The arbitrator has exclusive
authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br><br>

a limited, non-exclusive right to create a hypertext link to the Website found at <a href="https://www.linuxhostsupport.com">https://www.linuxhostsupport.com</a>; provided such link does not

constitutes the entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement between the parties relating to the
Services. A valid waiver hereunder shall not be interpreted to be a waiver of that obligation in the future or any other obligation under this Agreement. The failure of either party
to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of
Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law
or held to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected such that this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect as if such unenforceable provision had never constituted a part hereof. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute the same instrument. This Agreement may be signed electronically or, as set out above, your access and use of the Services will manifest your consent
to this Agreement. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign,
