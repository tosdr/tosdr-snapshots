or to provide you with information about services that may be of value to you. <br><br> Certain personal information Rose Web Services collects about you may be publicly available

requested information to speed up the signup process. However, you will be required to give us any missing information at a later time. While certain information may be optional, we
believe that by providing us with such information we will be able to serve you better.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect And Why?</h2>
<p>
The information we gather aides us to personalize, improve and operate the Services. You may voluntarily provide additional information about yourself to enable
us to provide the information or Services you are requesting. We store the information you provide about yourself in order to provide you with the information or Services you
request. Such information, with the exception of any Personal Information, is typically stored for the lifetime of the database unless you request that it be removed. The
information you provide us about yourself will be shared with our employees or contractors to the extent necessary to accommodate your request. We will obtain your consent in order
for us to share your Personal Information with third parties in a manner that is not permitted under the terms of this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise described below, we will not
use Personal Information provided to us online for purposes other than those you have requested without also providing you an opportunity to agree to or otherwise limit such
uses.<br><br> We may collect the following types of information from our users, some of which will be Personal Information and some of which will not be Personal
Information<br><br> USER CONTENT AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION:<br><br> As part of your Account information, Rose Web Services collects and stores information, including the full name,
company name, billing address, phone number, email address, IP address, payment information, landing page, and referring URL, for all users upon registration and use of the
Services. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow us, our
affiliates, our service providers, our sub-processors and our contractors to identify you and, therefore, your use of the Services may not be anonymous.<br><br> USE OF COLLECTED
INFORMATION<br><br> * Billing<br> * Fraud Detection<br> * Service Improvement<br> * Customer Analytics<br> * Marketing<br><br> Rose Web Services may process or store your Personal
Information outside the jurisdiction in which you reside and, if it does so, your Personal Information will be governed by the privacy laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
processed or stored and government and law enforcement agencies of that jurisdiction may be able to access such Personal Information without your consent. Wherever we are required
to transfer your Personal Information, regardless of where this occurs, we will strive to take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this
Privacy Policy. Please note that your submission of information or use of our Services will be deemed by us to signify explicit consent on your part to such transfer of information
to any part of the world, as long as we adhere to the applicable law.<br><br> FINANCIAL INFORMATION:<br><br> We use third party payment processing companies ("Payment Processors")
who collect and store financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), and their use and storage
of that information is governed by the Payment Processors' applicable terms of service and privacy policy. Collected billing information is used for the purposes of processing
billing payments and fraud detection.<br><br> IP ADDRESS INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:<br><br> We may automatically receive and record information from
your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address. An IP address is a number assigned to you by your Internet service provider so you can access the
Internet. We receive IP addresses in the normal course of the operation of our Site. We may automatically collect and record information about your use of features of our Services,
about the functionality of our Services, and other information related to your interactions with the Services. We use the information we automatically collect and record to analyze
trends, to administer, monitor and improve the Site and Services, to track users' use of the Site and Services, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do
not use IP addresses to identify you personally or disclose them to others. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning
your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).<br><br> Generally, the Services may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and
frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of
aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.<br><br>
INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM VPSes:<br><br> As one of our many Services, we provide virtual private servers. Certain monitoring metrics on your VPS is enabled automatically when your
VPS is created.<br><br> This monitoring collects information about CPU, disk, bandwidth, and memory usage as well as other system-level data and metrics about processes and services
that run on your VPS. You can use this data about your VPS to view metrics and track performance of your VPS. We may use data gathered from the VPSes to help us identify and
sanction abusive customers, improve our products and services and to develop future products and services. We may use Aggregate Information (as defined below) collected from VPSes
for marketing purposes.<br><br> INFORMATION COLLECTED USING COOKIES:<br><br> As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system and date/time stamp. To collect
this information, when you visit our Site, one ore more "cookies" may be set on your computer. Cookies contain a small amount of information that allows our web servers and those of
our partners, affiliates, sub-processors and contractors to recognize you whenever you visit. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and/or clear gifs to
create "settings" regarding your preferences. <br><br> We use cookie information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements and gather demographic information
for aggregate use. Rose Web Services also may use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the
Services through the Internet.<br><br> Rose Web Services also uses Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") as well as Google Adsense, Google Adwords
and Google Recaptcha, provided by the same company. Google Analytics and the other Google services use cookies to
collect non-identifying information, which may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google provides some additional privacy options described
at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a> regarding Google Analytics and other Google related
cookies.<br><br> Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your browser from
accepting new cookies or enable selective use of cookies.<br><br> INFORMATION RELATED TO ADVERTISING:<br><br> To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and
also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users. Rose Web Services may partner with third
parties to display advertisements targeted to visitors of the Services. To do so, Rose Web Services stores a cookie for visitors for the purpose of displaying advertising. Any ads
served by Google AdSense are subject to Google's Policies as shown at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/">
https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/</a>. If you are a resident of the EU you may have additional options and choices as shown at
<a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a><br><br>
AGGREGATE INFORMATION:<br><br> We may collect statistical information about how users use the Services ("Aggregate Information"). Some of this information may be derived from
Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information.<br><br> CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:<br><br> Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For
that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Site from those we know are under 18 years of age, and our Site is a general audience site not intended for users under
the age of 18.<br><br>

AGGREGATE INFORMATION:<br><br> We may share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of

Regardless, we reserve the right to contact you for informational or account-related purposes when we believe it
is necessary.<br><br> ACCESS TO PAYMENT PROCESSOR INFORMATION:<br><br> As stated above, we use Payment Processors to collect and store financial information. However, we may from
