<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Data Privacy Policy (“</span><b>Policy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) explains how Computer Lunch, LLC (referred to as “Computer Lunch”, “we”, “us”, or “our” in this Policy) collects, stores, uses, or otherwise processes the personal data of end users of our Services as defined below (referred to as “you” or “your” in this Policy), and what rights you have if we are processing your personal data. In this Policy, “</span><b>Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ refers to our Games, Websites, and any related services or properties we directly control. “</span><b>Games</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” refers to mobile, computer, and console games or applications that we own and operate. “</span><b>Websites</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” refers to websites and other online properties we control, including </span><a href="http://www.computerlunch.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.computerlunch.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.celltosingularity.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.celltosingularity.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We use the term “</span><b>your data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b>personal data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to refer to data that relates to you as an identified or identifiable individual (such as your name or email address), including non-personal data that can be combined with other data to potentially identify you.

<h3><b>3.2. ADVERTISING</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising is one of the tools that helps fund our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge. In some of our Games, we may show our own ads and also ads from third parties. We also advertise our Games outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications. This section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes. Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers. An “</span><b>Advertising ID</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of your mobile device (e.g. your phone or tablet). It is consistent across applications from different publishers. The Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (“</span><b>IDFA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (“</span><b>GAID</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) on Android devices. Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes. You can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes. Using the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID. For example, you can “limit ad tracking” on iOS devices or “opt out of interest-based ads” on Android devices. These settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them as you prefer on each of your devices individually. It may take some time for your updated settings to take effect. Please consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads or necessarily reduce the number of ads you see, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you and will not be served based on your personal data. For more information on mobile privacy settings, you may refer to third-party resources such as: </span><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a><b>When you see ads in our Games</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners if you have given your consent to the use of your data for personalized ads. Our advertising partners may also collect information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs). In each case, they may use your data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID). For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed </span><a href="https://www.tiltingpoint.com/data-recipients"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you do not provide us with consent to use your data for personalized ads, we will not share your personal data (such as Advertising ID) with our advertising partners and will indicate to them that you have not consented to the use of this data for personalized ads.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>When you see our ads outside of our Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services. Ad networks may also use your data to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit the number of times you see our ads;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games; or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, ad networks may provide services where they use Advertising IDs or other identifiers to find users who are likely to be interested in our Services because their past activity or interests are similar to those of others known by the ad network to use our Services. When ad-networks use your Advertising ID in these ways, they do so based on their respective privacy policies or notices.</span></p>
<p><b>For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad. Measurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads. This data is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.</span></p>
<h2><b>4. WHAT DATA DO WE PROCESS?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may process the following data relating to you:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you make purchases in our Games, information we receive from third-party payment service providers to validate those purchases;</span></li>

<h2><b>8. HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR DATA?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have adopted measures to provide your data a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved with the data processing activities described in this Policy.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your Rights</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights to their personal information. If you are a California resident, you may exercise these rights as explained below.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit a request to exercise your rights, we are required to verify that you are the consumer to whose personal information the request relates or a person authorized to act on that consumer’s behalf. If you submit your request using the automated tools provided in our Games, we will usually not need additional information to verify your request. For requests submitted by other means (for example, by email), we may ask you to provide additional information about the account to which the request relates to enable us to confirm that you are the account holder or acting on their behalf.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Right to Know</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have the right to know what personal information about you we collect, from which sources, for which purposes, and with whom we share it. You also have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. This request can be made free of charge twice in any 12-month period. Moreover, you have the right to know which categories of personal information we have sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For information on what personal information we collect, from which sources, for which purposes, with whom we share it, and whether we disclose it for business purposes, please refer to section 2 of this Disclosure. In addition, section 3 of this Disclosure describes the extent to which we may “sell” your personal information in the meaning of the CCPA.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may request a copy of your personal information by contacting us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@computerlunch.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@computerlunch.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For more information, please refer to section 9 of our Privacy Policy, above.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following your deletion request, we may either erase or de-identify your personal information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Right to Opt-Out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You have the right to direct us to not “sell” your personal information (please see Section 3 of this Disclosure for further details on what this means under the CCPA and the situations in which we might do so). If you decline to give consent or contact us to opt out, we will no longer share your identifiers and other information with our ad partners to make the ads you see more relevant to you. To exercise your right to opt-out, please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:privacy@computerlunch.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@computerlunch.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or decline to give consent to such sharing within a Game when you see a message asking for consent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share the information with recipients such as our service providers to achieve these business purposes. This means that we may disclose the categories of personal information listed above for a business purpose.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some features of our Games (for example surveys, or tools used to contact our player support) may allow you to submit information about yourself to us. We may collect any information you choose to submit to us using these features. In addition to the personal information listed in the table above, this may include other categories of personal information specified in the CCPA, including:</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only collect these categories of personal information directly from you, and you may choose not to submit this information to us at your discretion. We may use the personal information you choose to submit for performing our services (for example, to handle your support enquiries) and short-term, transient uses, and we may share the information with recipients such as our service providers to achieve these business purposes. This means that we may disclose these categories of personal information for a business purpose.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How We May Sell Your Personal Information</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the CCPA, a business is required to provide notice to a consumer before the business sells the consumer’s personal information to third parties. the CCPA defines a “sale” as not only exchanges for monetary consideration, but also disclosures of personal information for other valuable consideration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. However, we may disclose a limited amount of your personal information (i) to our advertising partners to enable them to deliver an ad that is relevant to you or (ii) to our marketing partners to enable them to send you relevant offers when you have opted in to such communication. This includes the following categories of your personal information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identifiers (generally including an advertising ID and your IP address for ad partners and name and email for marketing partners); and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internet or other electronic network activity information (including technical information required to select and deliver the appropriate ad type and format).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this disclosure of information could be deemed a “sale” in the meaning of the CCPA, we either ask for your explicit consent or provide a means for you to direct us to not disclose your personal information to our advertising or marketing partners for the above purposes. To learn how to exercise your right to opt-out, please see “Right to Opt Out,” above.</span></p>
<p>If we have actual knowledge that you are under 16 years old, we will not sell your personal information without affirmative authorization.</p>
