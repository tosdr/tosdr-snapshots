<h1>All about being a Creator</h1>
<p><strong>Studio gives creators the opportunity to share their behind the scenes content to make money on the Studio platform. There are a lot of details involving payments, licensing, and restrictions, which you should read in full before applying for a creator account.</strong></p>
<h2>What it means to be a creator</h2>
<p><em>In summary: Creators are website users with special accounts that allow them to share behind the scenes content with Studio’s customers.</em></p>
<p>To become a creator, you must apply at studio.com/creators. You will be asked to share some basic information in your application.</p>
<p>Your application will then be submitted to Studio for approval. Studio is solely responsible for approving creator account requests at its own discretion.</p>
<p>If your request is approved, you will then be able to upload content, which Studio’s customers will be able to purchase access to according to the terms below.</p>
<p>To get paid as a creator, you will need to provide additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information associated with a PayPal or U.S. bank account in good standing which you own and at which you can receive payments from a U.S. based company.</li>
<li>Any identifying information or tax documentation (such as W-9 or W-8) necessary for Studio to be able to pay you your earnings</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to delete your creator account, you can contact us using the contact information provided below. We&#x27;ll use commercially reasonable efforts to make any remaining scheduled payments that are owed to you before deleting your account. However, if customers have previously purchased your content, your name and that content may remain accessible to those customers after your account is deleted.</p>
<h2>Pricing &amp; payments</h2>
<h3><strong>How to set the price of your content</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Creators can choose how to price their content and whether to participate in promotional programs that help increase revenue potential. You can opt out of promotional programs if you don’t want to participate.</em></p>
<p>When creating content available for purchase on Studio, you will be prompted to select a base price for your content from a list of available price tiers.</p>
<p>Studio offers several optional marketing programs in which you can choose to participate. These programs can help increase your revenue potential on Studio by finding the optimal price point for your content, getting your content in front of more users (via email campaigns and/or paid ad campaigns), and offering access to your content through loyalty programs, subscription programs, and other marketing programs.</p>
<p>Your content will be automatically opted in to participate in marketing programs, but you can modify your participation status at any time. Changes you make will not apply to currently active campaigns and certain programs may have additional requirements on termination.</p>
<p>If you opt out of any marketing programs, we will list your content for the base price. If you opt to participate in a marketing program, we may set a different discounted price or list price for your content.</p>
<p>When you upload content, you give us permission to share your content for free with our employees, with selected partners, and in cases where we need to restore access to accounts who have previously purchased your content. You will not receive compensation in these cases.</p>
<p>If a user purchases a product or service in a country that requires Studio to remit national, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (VAT), or other similar transaction taxes, under applicable law, we will collect and remit those transaction taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase the sale price at our discretion where we determine that such taxes may be due. For purchases through mobile applications, applicable transaction taxes are collected by the mobile platform (such as Apple&#x27;s App Store or Google Play).</p>
<h3><strong>How creator earnings are calculated</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Creators earn a share of revenue from content they sell. The amount of the revenue share depends on whether the purchase was made through the creator’s unique User Referral Link or not.</em></p>
<p>When you are approved for a creator account, you will receive a unique User Referral Link for your use in marketing and promoting your content. The amount of the revenue share you receive from purchases of your content depends on whether the customer originated from your user referral link or not.</p>
<p>If the customer followed your user referral link and purchased your content in the same browser and the same session or in session that shares a web cookie, you will receive 90% of the net amount of the purchase of your content. You’ll receive 50% of the net amount of any other purchases of your content.</p>
<p>&quot;Net Amount&quot; means the gross amounts received and retained by Studio directly from sales of Content after deduction of third-party payment processing fees, refunds, discounts, credits and sales tax, and in the case you are opted into Studio’s paid marketing program, marketing costs directly associated with your content.</p>
<p>If we change this payment rate, we will provide you 30 days notice using prominent means, such as via email or by posting a notice through our Services.</p>
<p>The creator earnings will be paid to you on a monthly basis in accordance with Studio’s customary accounting policies (i.e., 30 days following the end of each calendar month in which there are any creator earnings to be paid).</p>
<p>Users have the right to receive a refund, as detailed in the Terms. Creators will not receive any revenue from transactions for which a refund has been granted.</p>
<p>You are responsible for promoting your content using your unique link, and Studio will not be responsible for any user’s failure to utilize your unique link in the registration and payment process. Studio has the right to offset any overpayment to you against future payments or demand that you promptly repay such overpayment to Studio. Studio will be entitled to withhold or deduct any amounts required to be withheld or deducted by law.</p>
<p>Studio makes all creator payments in U.S. dollars (USD) regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. Studio is not responsible for your foreign currency conversion fees, wiring fees, or any other processing fees that you may incur. Your revenue report will show your converted revenue amount in USD.</p>
<h3><strong>How creators can refer other creators</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Creators can refer other creators in order to receive referral payments worth 5% of the referred creator’s earnings, up to $100,000.</em></p>
<p>Studio offers a referral program by which existing creators can introduce people who are interested in becoming creators to Studio and receive referral payments from Studio.</p>
<p>If you successfully refer a new creator, you will receive 5% of the creator earnings derived from their content in the year after they register, up to a maximum referral payment of $100,000 per referred creator.</p>
<p>Only creators with a current creator account can participate in the Creator Referral Program. If a creator account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the creator, that creator will not be able to participate in the Creator Referral Program.</p>
<p>To participate in the Creator Referral Program, you can share your unique Creator Referral Link (found on your creator account page) with other people who are interested in becoming creators. If they register for a creator account after clicking on your Creator Referral Link using the same browser and in the same session, and are approved for a creator account, then you will be their referrer.</p>
<p>Please note that if the referred creator is owned or operated by you, or if they already had an account with Studio, they are not eligible for referral, and if they create multiple accounts, you will only be considered the referrer for any revenue related to their first account.</p>
<p>You are responsible for sharing your Creator Referral Link, and Studio will not be responsible for any Creator’s failure to utilize the Creator Referral Link in the registration process.</p>
<p>When promoting Studio, you must not impersonate Studio, and you must not give a false impression of Studio, the services, programs, and materials made available through Studio, its users or the Terms of Service; and you must not make any statements which suggest to a potential creator that the potential creator will make any money from their use of Studio, or any statements regarding the likely number of purchasers of their content.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the Creator Referral Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is illegal for us or any Creator to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to join the Creator Referral Program.</li>
<li>Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the Creator Referral Program.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How creators receive payments</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: We make payments to U.S. bank accounts or PayPal accounts. You need to provide accurate identifying information and tax documentation to receive payment.</em></p>
<p>For us to pay you in a timely manner, you need to own a PayPal or U.S. bank account in good standing and must keep us informed of the correct email and other identifying information associated with your account. You must also provide any identifying information or tax documentation (such as a W-9 or W-8) necessary for payment of amounts due, and you agree that we have the right to withhold appropriate taxes from your payments. We reserve the right to withhold payments if we do not receive proper identifying information or tax documentation from you. You are ultimately responsible for any taxes on your income, and you are responsible for determining whether you are eligible to be paid by a U.S. company.</p>
<p>If we cannot settle funds into your payment account after the period of time set forth by your state, country, or other government authority in its unclaimed property laws, we may process the funds due to you in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting those funds to the appropriate government authority as required by law.</p>
<p>We may withhold all or any part of the payments due to you but not yet paid out if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service, or if we suspect that all or any part of the payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity, either by you, by the customer who purchased the content which resulted in the payment, or by the referred creator to whom the purchase was made which resulted in the referral payment.</p>
<h2>Trademarks &amp; licensing</h2>
<h3><strong>How we license your content</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Studio does not claim any intellectual property rights over creator content. We license content from creators according to the rules below.</em></p>
<p>We do not claim any intellectual property rights over your content. By uploading the content to Studio, you grant Studio a worldwide, royalty free license to display, sell, market, or otherwise use your content. You also authorize Studio to sublicense these rights to your content to third parties, including to users directly and through paid advertising on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>If you remove any of your content from the website, Studio’s right to sublicense the rights for the removed content will terminate with respect to new users 30 days after you remove it.

<p>We may use your content for marketing and operating the Website. You grant Studio permission to use your name, nickname, image, likeness, voice, and statements in connection with marketing and operating the website, your content, or Studio’s content, and you waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent permissible under applicable law.</p>
<h3><strong>How we keep your content safe from piracy</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Studio partners with anti-piracy vendors to help protect creator content. If you’d like to opt out of piracy protection, you can contact us.</em></p>
<p>We partner with anti-piracy vendors to help protect your content from unauthorized use. As a user of a creator account, you appoint Studio and our anti-piracy vendors as your agents for the purpose of enforcing copyrights for your content, through notice and takedown processes (for example, under DMCA) and for other efforts to enforce those copyrights. You also grant Studio and our anti-piracy vendors primary authority to file notices on your behalf to enforce your copyright interests.</p>
<p>If you’d like to revoke those rights, you can do so by sending an email to legal@studio.com with the subject line: &quot;Revoke Anti-Piracy Protection Rights&quot; from the email address associated with your account. Any revocation of rights will be effective 48 hours after we receive it.</p>
<h3><strong>How you can use our trademarks</strong></h3>
<p><em>In summary: Creators can use Studio’s trademarks as long as they abide by our guidelines.</em></p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p><em>In summary: This provision requires that all disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Acceptance of these terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation and opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. This includes a Class Action Waiver.</em></p>
<p><strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong></p>
<p>This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort — including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence — or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and us. Effectively, &quot;dispute&quot; is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
<p>This Provision provides that all disputes between you and us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney&#x27;s fees). You may, however, opt out of this Provision which means you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong></p>
<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing us at legal@studio.com the following information: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or we may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the &quot;Opt-Out Deadline&quot;). You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing us at legal@studio.com the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. Your decision to opt out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us. But we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline, so keep in mind that <strong>any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong></p>
<p>If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration only and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>
<p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA&#x27;s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA&#x27;s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action or representative procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
<p><em>Arbitration Award</em> — The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p><em>Location of Arbitration</em> — You or we may initiate arbitration in either California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.</p>
<p><em>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</em> — So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any arbitrator&#x27;s hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration. But you will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys&#x27; fees or expert witnesses. In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with us as provided in the section above titled &quot;Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution&quot; and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney&#x27;s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and we specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration. <strong>If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong> Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
<p><strong>No Judge or Jury in Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms you and we are each giving up the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and we might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p><strong>Continuation</strong></p>
<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the present language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>

You will be asked to share some basic information in your application.\\n\\nYour application will then be submitted to Studio for approval. Studio is solely responsible for approving creator account requests at its own discretion.\\n\\nIf your request is approved, you will then be able to upload content, which Studio’s customers will be able to purchase access to according to the terms below.\\n\\nTo get paid as a creator, you will need to provide additional information:\\n\\n- The information associated with a PayPal or U.S. bank account in good standing which you own and at which you can receive payments from a U.S. based company.\\n- Any identifying information or tax documentation (such as W-9 or W-8) necessary for Studio to be able to pay you your earnings\\n\\nIf you’d like to delete your creator account, you can contact us using the contact information provided below.

Changes you make will not apply to currently active campaigns and certain programs may have additional requirements on termination.\\n\\nIf you opt out of any marketing programs, we will list your content for the base price. If you opt to participate in a marketing program, we may set a different discounted price or list price for your content.\\n\\nWhen you upload content, you give us permission to share your content for free with our employees, with selected partners, and in cases where we need to restore access to accounts who have previously purchased your content.

Acceptance of these terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation and opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. This includes a Class Action Waiver._\\n\\n**Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.**\\n\\nThis Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort — including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence — or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and us. Effectively, \\\"dispute\\\" is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.\\n\\nThis Provision provides that all disputes between you and us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney's fees). You may, however, opt out of this Provision which means you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.\\n\\n**Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution**\\n\\nFor all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing us at legal@studio.com the following information: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.\\n\\n**Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out**\\n\\nNotwithstanding the above, you or we may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the \\\"Opt-Out Deadline\\\"). You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing us at legal@studio.com the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. Your decision to opt out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us. But we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline, so keep in mind that **any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.**\\n\\n**Arbitration Procedures**\\n\\nIf this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration only and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.\\n\\nFor arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules \u0026 Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action or representative procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.\\n\\nBecause this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\\\"FAA\\\") governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\\n\\n*Arbitration Award* — The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\\n\\n*Location of Arbitration* — You or we may initiate arbitration in either California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.\\n\\n*Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs* — So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any arbitrator's hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration. But you will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys' fees or expert witnesses. In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with us as provided in the section above titled \\\"Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\\\" and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.\\n\\n**Class Action Waiver**\\n\\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and we specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration. **If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.** Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.\\n\\n**No Judge or Jury in Arbitration**\\n\\nArbitration does not involve a judge or jury. You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms you and we are each giving up the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and we might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.\\n\\n**Severability**\\n\\nIf any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.\\n\\n**Continuation**\\n\\nThis Provision shall survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the present language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.\\n\\n## Local Laws \u0026 Language\\n\\n_In summary: We are headquartered in the United States of America, and do business in English._\\n\\nWe control and operate this website from our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of this website may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.
