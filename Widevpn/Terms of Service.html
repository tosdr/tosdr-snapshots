You will not use the WideVPN Web Sites or solutions to transmit, either directly or indirectly, any unsolicited bulk e-mail or unsolicited commercial e-mail. You will not use the WideVPN solutions in any way that is unlawful, criminal, or harms WideVPN, its affiliates, resellers, distributors, service providers and/or suppliers (each, an “WideVPN Party” and collectively, the “WideVPN Parties”) or any customer of an WideVPN Party, as determined in WideVPN’s sole discretion or any other person.

<p><b>5. WideVPN MAKES NO WARRANTY</b><br><br>
 
WideVPN provides the WideVPN web sites “as is,” “with all faults” and “as available,” and the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the WideVPN parties make no representations, warranties or conditions, express or implied. The WideVPN parties disclaim any and all warranties or conditions, express, statutory and implied, including without limitation
 
(1) warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort, accuracy, title, quiet enjoyment, no encumbrances, no liens and non-infringement,
 
(2) warranties or conditions arising through course of dealing or usage of trade, and (3) warranties or conditions that access to or use of the WideVPN web sites will be uninterrupted or error-free.

<p><b>6. LIABILITY LIMITATION; YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY</b><br><br>
 
In no event will any WideVPN party be liable for any damages, including without limitation any indirect, consequential, special, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of, based on, or resulting from this agreement or your use of the WideVPN web sites, even if such WideVPN party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The exclusion of damages under section 10 is independent of your exclusive remedy and survives in the event such remedy fails of its essential purpose or is otherwise deemed unenforceable. These limitations and exclusions apply without regard to whether the damages arise from (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of warranty, (3) negligence, or (4) any other cause of action, to the extent such exclusion and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law. If you are dissatisfied with the WideVPN web sites, you do not agree with any part of this agreement, or you have any other dispute or claim with or against any WideVPN party with respect to this agreement or the WideVPN web sites, then your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the WideVPN web sites.</p><br>

The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers in sections 9, 10 and 11 of this agreement apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and are not intended to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you under applicable law.</p><br>
 
<p><b>8. TERMINATION; ACCESS RESTRICTION</b><br><br>
 
WideVPN may terminate this Agreement, or terminate or suspend your access to the WideVPN Web Sites at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon such termination or suspension, your right to use the WideVPN Web Sites will immediately cease.
 
<p><b>9. INTERPRETING THE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT</b><br><br>
