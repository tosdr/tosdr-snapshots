These are the reasons we rely on when it comes to the services that are covered by this policy: </p><ol><li><p><b>Doing What We Promised (a.k.a Contract Performance)</b>: If we’ve agreed to provide a service to you, like enabling you to earn or spend Virgin Points, to buy train tickets or to access your accounts with other Virgin companies using your Virgin ID, we&#x27;ll use your information to provide that service.  </p></li><li><p><b>Our Legitimate Interest</b>: Sometimes, we use your information where we or a third party has a legitimate interest or gains a benefit from doing so and this is not outweighed by your interests or legal rights. For example, if we know what you like, we can make your Virgin experience even better – through better ways to earn or spend your Virgin Points, more favourable pricing on train travel, or a more tailored experience with Virgin companies that are connected using your Virgin ID. Rest assured, we always consider the impact that using your data in this way has on you and you have the right to ‘opt-out’ of this processing at any time. </p></li><li><p><b>Playing by the Rules (a.k.a Legal Obligations)</b>: If the law says we need to use your information in a certain way, we will. For example, we might need to keep a record of transactions or provide your personal information to law enforcement agencies. </p></li><li><p><b>With Your Consent</b>: Sometimes, we&#x27;ll ask you if we can use your information for certain things. For example, you can agree to access your location when you use our products/services, or opt in to receive marketing about all things Virgin or the Virgin.com newsletter. And if you change your mind, that’s no problem – you can ‘opt-out’ at any time.  </p></li></ol><p></p><h2 class="jsx-3490204660 header-two"><span class="jsx-1496761812 text">Section 2 - Membership of Virgin Red</span></h2><p><b>2.1 How we collect information on Virgin Red members?</b></p><p>We collect, use, share and store your personal information when you use our services or interact with us, Virgin Points or our partners.

One of the main ways we use your information is to understand your relationships with our Virgin Red Partners and to build a reward programme that is personalised just for you so that you can earn and spend Virgin Points on rewards you might like. </p><p>To give you access to our products and services, there’s some information that we need from you. Other information is optional but you might want to provide it so that we can provide an even better and more personalised experience for you.</p><p><b>2.4 Examples of how and why we use Virgin Red member information</b></p><p><b>Account transactions and support  </b> </p><p>Let&#x27;s talk about the things we do with your account and how we&#x27;ve got your back: </p><ul><li><p><b>Account Access and use</b>: When you join us and log in, we need your information to create your account, give you access to it and make sure it&#x27;s secure.  </p></li><li><p><b>Virgin Points transactions</b>: Every time you earn or spend Virgin Points, we get information either directly from you or from our partners. Say, if you earn a bunch of points by buying a delicious case of wine, the wine retailer will send us the details (like how many points you earned and on what product). And when you spend those points on a QR code for a hot drink, we get the details of that too.  </p></li><li><p><b>We&#x27;ve Got Your Back</b>: If you ever need help (like if you’re missing points or have questions), we&#x27;re here for you and we’ll use your information to resolve the issue and improve our processes.  </p></li><li><p><b>Keeping You in the Loop</b>: We’ll let you know about things that are relevant to the Virgin Red programme and the services we provide, like if you can no longer spend points with a particular partner. </p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Exchanging information with partners and suppliers.  </b></p><p>We work with our partners and suppliers to bring you even better services. Here&#x27;s how we share your information with them: </p><ul><li><p><b>Linking your Accounts</b>: If you link your Virgin Red account with a partner&#x27;s account, your transactions and information might be shared so you can see your Virgin Points in both places and/or so the two accounts can work together. For example, if you link your account with a wine retailer account and earn points on a wine purchase, this information will be shared between us and the wine retailer – the transaction will show in both accounts and you may also receive more relevant wine offers in the future – cheers to that!  </p></li><li><p><b>Getting to Know You</b>: We want to know what makes you tick so we can give you a better service. That&#x27;s why we might track or receive information from our partners about your behaviour online. We use this to help linked accounts work better together and  to show you more relevant offers. For example, if you browse offers on a partner’s website, we might receive insights on the offers you’re interested in and use this to show you more things you might like.   </p></li><li><p><b>Sharing information on your membership status, product or service usage</b>: We&#x27;re all about making things just better for you. So, where we’re allowed to, we might share additional information with our partners about things like your purchases, spend or usage of products or services. We use this information to tailor our services to you. For example, by showing you more things you like and fewer things you don’t like.  </p></li><li><p><b>Competition Time!</b> If there&#x27;s a competition going on, we might need to share your information with our agents, prize suppliers or other third parties involved in administering the competition and fulfilling the prizes.  </p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Using your information for marketing.</b></p><ul><li><p><b>Unless you’ve told us that you don’t want to hear from us,</b> we&#x27;ll use your information to keep you up-to-date with our latest exciting news, exclusive rewards and to share details of any offers or prizes from Virgin Red and/or our partners. These updates may be tailored just for you. <b>Check out section 2.5 if you want more information on how we use your data for marketing purposes.</b>  </p></li></ul><p><i></i></p><p><b>Personalising our services to you. </b></p><ul><li><p><b>Whether you’re into skydiving or more of an afternoon tea kind of person, we want to know about it. </b>We use your information to understand your habits and preferences so we can personalise, enhance and improve your Virgin Red experience and how we talk to you.  </p></li><li><p>We might use things like your browsing history, membership information and your earn and spend activity, to learn about you, personalise our interactions with you and give you a tailored experience, both online and offline.  </p></li><li><p>We might also combine information from different sources, including our own services, to create a profile that might be used to determine the likelihood that you’ll do something and then use this to tailor our services to you.

This could be letting you know about a great offer that a Virgin Red partner or a Virgin company has available, or letting you know about the events or causes that Virgin or the Branson family have been involved in recently. </p></li><li><p>We may also get in touch to keep you in the loop on Virgin ID and the services we provide – like if there&#x27;s a new Virgin Partner you can use Virgin ID with. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Personalising our services to you:</b></p><ul><li><p>We want to personalise, enhance and improve your Virgin experience and our communications with you to give you a more tailored experience both online and offline. To do this, we may use your personal information, like your browsing history with your Virgin ID, to learn more about you and help us understand your habits and preferences.  </p></li><li><p>We may also put together what we know about you from different sources (including out Virgin Partners and our different services) and create a profile that can help us to understand your propensity to do something so we can tailor our services just for you.  </p></li><li><p>If you’re not up for this, no worries – you can opt out of sharing your personal data for these purposes at any time by changing the setting in your account space </p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="jsx-3490204660 header-two"><span class="jsx-1496761812 text">Section 7 - Cookies and Targeting (including via social media)</span></h2><p><b>7.1 What are cookies?</b></p><p>Let&#x27;s talk about cookies.

They send information back to whoever served the cookie.  </p><p>Cookies also refer to similar tracking technologies, like tags, web beacons, pixels and, for mobile apps, software development kits or SDKs.

Cookies also help us to measure how effective our advertising is. Sometimes, we combine data we collect through cookies from multiple devices with other data sources we have, like your Virgin Red transactional data. </p><p>Here are some examples of how we use cookies in our different online channels:  </p><p><b>Virgin.com</b></p><ul><li><p>We operate the Virgin.com website, which is where you can access Virgin Red.

This helps us gather information about how you use our apps– things like which version you&#x27;re using, when you last logged in, how often you log in and what you like to look at when you do, your device, device resolution, mobile network carrier and so on.  </p></li><li><p><b>Ads Just for You:</b> We only want to show you things you’re interested in, so we might personalise the ads shown to you on other apps and websites based on how you interact with Virgin Red or Virgin Trains Ticketing, using data about your transactions with us. Analysing how members use our apps helps us measure performance and lets us personalise and improve our services and marketing.  </p></li><li><p><b>Referral Magic:</b> When you use our referral program, powered by Mention Me, cookies make sure the whole referral process works smoothly You can read more about which cookies are applied by Mention Me in their <a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://mention-me.com/help/privacy_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><u>policies</u></b></a>. These cookies are necessary so you can&#x27;t turn them off, but they won&#x27;t be applied unless you visit these pages. </p></li><li><p><b>Connecting the Dots:</b> When you shop with one of our partners through Virgin Red, your transaction is recorded via a unique ID and code on the partner’s website/app. We get this information so we know that a transaction has taken place and so we can credit your well-deserved Virgin Points to your account. </p></li></ul><p><b>7.4 What third parties do we use in relation to cookies?</b></p><p>We&#x27;ve got some helpers on board to help us figure out how our users (you!) use our apps and websites, pull together reports on related activities and provide other services relating to website and app activity and usage. These are our third-party analytics providers. They collect information like where you&#x27;re browsing from (your IP address), when you last visited, and if you&#x27;ve been here before. They also check out what device and version of software you&#x27;re using and if you came to our apps or websites from somewhere else.  </p><p> The information that gathered will be transmitted to and stored by these third party providers and their privacy policies may apply to the data. But don’t worry, they aren’t sharing any data that they collect on our behalf – in fact, they’re not allowed to sell that information to anyone. </p><p>Here are the third party websites we’re talking about: </p><ul><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://policies.google.com/?hl=en&amp;gl=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Google Analytics</b></a></p></li><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://tealium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Tealium</b></a></p></li><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Firebase</b></a></p></li><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://branch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Branch</b></a></p></li><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://mention-me.com/help/privacy_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mention Me</a></p></li><li><p><a class="jsx-3698047057" href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotjar</a></p></li></ul><p><b>7.5 Social media targeting</b></p><p>Alright, let&#x27;s dive into the digital world of ads and targeting. Targeting just means the ability to choose the people who are shown ads. We do this using demographic and behavioural data like your age, interests, what you usually do online and other information we hold about you. </p><ul><li><p><b>To interact with you online. </b>If you interact with us online (by liking a social media page for example), we might send you a direct communication via that channel.</p></li><li><p><b>We use your personal information to create &quot;lookalike&quot; audiences. </b>We might use information about you to create customer profiles and then find people with similar profiles online (like on social media platforms like Facebook) and show them ads we think they might be interested in. </p></li><li><p><b>We use your personal information to place advertising we think you’ll like on online media channels. </b>We want to make sure the ads you see are interesting to you and we sometimes team up with service providers like online media and social media channels to help us target our ads online. Like, if you&#x27;re a Virgin Red member, you might spot ads about products or services related to Virgin Red on social media. We might also confirm or ‘match’ your information (like your email address) with our service providers to facilitate this.  </p></li></ul><p><b>7.6 Can I opt out of the use of cookies and social media targeting?</b></p><p><b>Apps</b></p><ul><li><p>In our apps, you&#x27;re the boss. You can pick which cookies you’re happy with when you start using the apps, or later in the &#x27;Settings&#x27; section. Be aware that some cookies are necessary for the apps to work and they can’t be turned off. </p></li></ul><p><b>Websites</b></p><ul><li><p>You can opt out directly by clicking on the cookie banner on virgin.com. Check out more details on this in the Virgin.com Cookie Policy <a class="jsx-3698047057" href="/cookie-policy">here</a>. </p></li><li><p>You might also be able to block some cookies by playing around with your browser settings. Your browser settings will have more information on this. Just be aware – if you block or delete cookies, you may not be able to get the most out of our services. And just so you know, our services don&#x27;t currently change when they get a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal or similar. </p></li></ul><p><b>Social media targeting</b></p><ul><li><p>When it comes to social media marketing it&#x27;s the rules of each social media platform that will apply.  For some social media platforms, you may be able to update your ad preferences to turn off personalised ads altogether, but it might come at a cost.  Check out the social media platform&#x27;s terms to see what the options are.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class="jsx-3490204660 header-two"><span class="jsx-1496761812 text">Section 8 - Important Information</span></h2><p><b>The following relates to all the services we provide. </b></p><p><b>8.1 Personal information relating to under 18s</b></p><p>The Virgin Red programme is available to those aged 18 and over, so we don’t collect personal information on children.  </p><p>Virgin Trains Ticketing is also available to those aged 18 or over, or those aged 16 and 17 with parental consent.

We also follow access management procedures, making sure that our staff only have access to personal information that is necessary to their role and that they are qualified to access it.  </p><p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and carry out testing to find ways to strengthen our security even further.  </p><p>When it comes to getting into your account, we’re always thinking about the best way for you to get access – be that through passwords, one-time passcodes or passkeys (such as face ID or fingerprint ID on your mobile phone). Where passkeys are available, it entirely your choice if you want to use them.  </p><p>Remember though, while we&#x27;re serious about keeping things safe and putting appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to protect your information, the internet&#x27;s a big place and no transmission of data over the internet or public network can ever be guaranteed as 100% secure. So, it’s important that you keep your email account and access to your devices secure against unauthorised access.
