Our privacy policy helps you understand what we do with your information.</h3><p>We collect personal information from you as you use BoardGameGeek, BoardGameGeek Store, VideoGameGeek, RPGGeek, or any of our other websites (referred to here as our &quot;<strong>websites</strong>&quot;). This privacy policy explains how we&mdash;BoardGameGeek, LLC, and our affiliates&mdash;use that information and what choices you have about it.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy applies to <strong>ALL</strong> of our websites, whether you access them through a web browser, a mobile app, or another way. Our privacy policy does <strong>NOT</strong> apply to information collected on you by someone else. In those cases, you should consult that person&rsquo;s privacy policy.</p>

<p><em>About mobile apps</em>: We do not provide a mobile app. However, our fans sometimes create unofficial BoardGameGeek mobile apps through which you can access our websites. <strong>We are not affiliated with any mobile apps and do not know how they handle your personal information.</strong> Please read each mobile app&rsquo;s privacy policies before using it.</p>

 <p>&ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; does <strong>NOT</strong> include information that we have made anonymous so that it can no longer be used to identify you. We collect anonymized data from our users for internal statistical purposes and for providing our services (such as product ratings, top games, and other trends displayed on our websites). We may pass on this anonymous grouped data to third parties, but it will not be associated with your identity.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>A. What rights do I have under the GDPR?</h3>You have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to:<br />
<ul>
    <li>access your information</li>
    <li>change or correct your information</li>
    <li>erase your information</li>
    <li>restrict our use of your personal information under certain circumstances</li>

</div><a class='anchor-target' name="B_What_is_your_lawful_basis_for_using_my_personal_information"></a>				<a class="anchor-target" id="toc10"></a>
				<div>
					<h3>B. What is your lawful basis for using my personal information?</h3><p>There are a couple of reasons we believe we are allowed to collect, use, and store your personal information under the GDPR.</p>

<p><em>With your consent</em>. When you directly give us personal information for a certain purpose or otherwise express your consent, we can use that personal information for that certain purpose. If you consent for us to do so, we may use your personal information to, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>display your public profile;</li>
    <li>facilitate your trades and purchases;</li>
    <li>personalize and improve the advertisements displayed to you on our website;</li>
    <li>send you our marketing emails; or</li>
    <li>verify that you are over 18 years of age.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time. Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you would like to revoke your prior consent to any of these uses.</p>

<p><em>For our legitimate interests</em>. However, we do not always need your express consent to use your information. We can use your personal information as needed for our legitimate interests, so long as those interests do not conflict with your fundamental privacy rights and freedoms. These legitimate interests include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>improving the presentation, operation, and experience of our services; </li>
    <li>evaluating and updating our technical infrastructure; and</li>
    <li>monitoring and improving the information security of our websites.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>By contract</em>. A contract also creates a basis for using your information. By accepting our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>, a contract is formed between us and you so that we may provide you our services. We can use your personal information as needed to provide our services to you under that contract.</p>

<p><em>Law, protection, or the public good</em>. We can also use your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, protect the vital interests of our users, and as needed for the public good. This may include using your personal information to prevent and handle potential fraud, security breaches or other prohibited activities.</p>

</div></div><a class='anchor-target' name="6_How_long_do_you_store_my_information"></a>				<a class="anchor-target" id="toc11"></a>
				<div>
					<h2>6. How long do you store my information?</h2>If you do not have an account, we will store your personal information as long as needed in the interest of system security, fraud protection, or other legitimate interests.<br />
 If you have an account, we will store your personal information and user contributions indefinitely.<br />
 Generally, if you delete your account, we will continue to store your personal information for a short time in case of any issues, and then we will delete it in accordance with our standard procedures and applicable law. However, for security purposes, we continue to store your technical data for up to eighteen (18) months after your account deletion.<br />
 <p>Generally, if you delete your account, your user contributions will be removed in the same manner as your personal information. However, you should be careful disclosing information publicly or to other users. Although most types of user contributions will be removed upon your account deletion, any content you contributed to wiki pages, game descriptions, or other editable pages will remain public. Also, other users may still be able to access their copy of any private messages you sent to them while your account was active.</p>

<p>Chatroom logs are not stored. That information is deleted shortly after the chatroom closes.</p>

					<h2>7. Will you use my personal information to contact me?</h2><p>As needed, we will contact you by email about your account or use of our services.

You may opt out of these communications by clicking the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link within an email or by contacting us at contact@boardgamegeek.com, or just <a href="/contact">click here</a>.</p>

					<h3>B. Other people can also track you as your use our websites.</h3><p>Third parties who are uninvolved with BoardGameGeek may collect information about you while you are visiting our website and other websites. For example, third party marketers may use the information they collect on you to show you targeted ads across the web. BoardGameGeek works with Google&rsquo;s advertising platforms to serve you advertisements on our websites, however, Google does not give us access to the information it uses to place ads for you. BoardGameGeek also uses Youtube API Services. Google may use the personal information that they have collected about you on our sites pursuant to their own  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted content, you should contact the person who placed the ad.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>C. You have choices about how you are tracked.</h3>You are always free to block, delete, or disable tracking technologies if your browser, application, or device so permits. However, if you do so, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable these technologies, please review your browser or device settings.<br />
If you do not want us to use your personal information to show you targeted ads for games, accessories, and other products or services we think you&rsquo;d enjoy, you can opt-out by making the change in your <a href="/geekaccount/edit/privacy">privacy account settings</a>. However, we may still keep and use your personal information as explained in this privacy policy.<br />
 <p>Opting-out of our targeted ads will not prevent third parties from sending you targeted ads. You can opt out of targeted ads served via specific third party vendors by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Opt-Out page at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://optout.aboutads.info" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>.

					<h3>D. We are not set up to respond to &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals.</h3><p>You can also set your browser to refuse cookies by sending out a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal when you go to a website. California law requires us to disclose how we handle such a signal. However, since there is no standard for how websites should respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals, we do not support them and sending one won&rsquo;t change anything we do.</p>
