					<h2>15. YOU AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BOARDGAMEGEEK WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH MANDATORY ARBITRATION IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND NOT BY A COURT OR BY A JURY.</h2><a class='anchor-target' name="A_You_will_resolve_claims_with_an_arbitrator"></a>				<a class="anchor-target" id="toc42"></a>
				<div>
					<h3>A. You will resolve claims with an arbitrator</h3><p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Terms of Service, your or your authorized user&rsquo;s relationship with BoardGameGeek, or your or your authorized user&rsquo;s use of our services (collectively referred to as a <strong>&ldquo;claim&rdquo;</strong>) will be resolved <strong>exclusively by final and binding arbitration, rather than by a court or a jury. The only exception to such mandatory arbitration is that you are NOT prohibited from resolving any such dispute or claim as an individual claim in a small claims court.</strong> The exclusive venue for the arbitration shall be Dallas County, Texas.<br />
  <br />
<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</strong> However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the Terms of Service as a court would.</p>

</div><a class='anchor-target' name="B_You_are_waiving_your_right_to_a_jury_trial"></a>				<a class="anchor-target" id="toc43"></a>
				<div>
					<h3>B. You are waiving your right to a jury trial.</h3><p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial. You acknowledge that you make this jury waiver knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly.</strong></p>

</div><a class='anchor-target' name="C_You_will_arbitrate_under_certain_laws_and_rules"></a>				<a class="anchor-target" id="toc44"></a>
				<div>
					<h3>C. You will arbitrate under certain laws and rules.</h3><p>This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  The arbitration, and any appeal, shall be governed by the substantive law of the State of Texas and the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association <strong>(&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;)</strong>. <br />
If, for any reason, the arbitration or appeal cannot be conducted before AAA or pursuant to AAA rules, and the parties cannot agree to an alternative arbitration service or rules, any court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas, may appoint an arbitrator or select appropriate arbitration rules to govern the arbitration or appeal.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>D. The fees and costs can be split in different ways.</h3><p>Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator(s)&rsquo; fees and costs relating to the arbitration, subject to the arbitrator(s)&rsquo; authority to reallocate such fees and costs in his or her discretion. In any event, each party shall be responsible for payment of their own attorney&rsquo;s fees and legal costs.</p>

					<h3>E. Either of us can try to bring a temporary injunction against the other.</h3><p>Either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, exclusively, at any time until the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed. Once the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed, the arbitrator(s) shall assume responsibility for any further action or rulings with respect to any such temporary injunction action.  The parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts of Dallas County, Texas, solely for the purpose of any such temporary injunction action.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>F. You are waiving your right to bring a claim against us as part of a class-action lawsuit.</h3><p><strong>We each agree that any dispute, whether arbitrated or brought in small claims court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong>  Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each party agrees to pursue its claims on an individual basis and not to (1) join its claims with any other person or entity&rsquo;s claims, (2) pursue any claim as a representative of a class, as a private attorney general or in any representative capacity, or (3) participate in a class or collective action or mass action with respect to any claim.  It is the express intent of the parties that the arbitrator, or, as applicable, small claims court, shall not have the power to award class or collective relief or to determine or order that the dispute should proceed as a class or collective action, whether in arbitration or in any other forum or venue. The parties understand and acknowledge that by entering into this provision, <strong>we each are waiving our respective rights to have a court or jury adjudicate our claims.</strong></p>

					<h3>G.

Written notice of appeal shall be provided to the opposing party and the arbitration service and shall comply with the requirements of the AAA Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules or such other arbitration appellate rules to which the parties may agree or which a court may designate pursuant to the process described earlier in this Section.</p>
