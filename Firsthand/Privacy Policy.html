Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Advisor hereby acknowledges and agrees that Advisor (i) shall not record mentoring sessions or any content therein, or retain any communications or content therefrom, unless Advisor obtains advanced written approval and consent of each and every party, including the Advisee, participating in the mentoring session  and (ii) that the foregoing approval and consent is completely voluntarily and Advisor shall not alter or change the mentoring session in the event such approval and consent is withheld.</p><p> </p><ol><li><strong>How We Collect Personal Information/SOURCES</strong></li></ol><p> </p><p>Firsthand obtains your personal information directly from you when you provide it to us (i.e., direct collection) and from third parties (i.e., indirect collection), which includes the following:</p><p> </p><p><u>Direct Collection</u>. We often collect personal information directly from you when you undertake the following activities: use or access our Services; complete one of our web forms; contact our customer service centers or request information from us in any other way; visit one of our locations or premises; submit an order or make a purchase with us; provide us contact information via a business card or through similar communications; complete a survey or otherwise provide us feedback; report product/service issues; communicate with us via social networking websites, third party applications, or similar technologies; and/or visit, one of our trade counters at an exhibition.</p><p> </p><p><u>Indirect Collection</u>. We may collect personal information about you from third parties, which we may combine with other information we already retain in order to provide the Online Services or promote our legal or business interests.  For example, Institutions that partner with Firsthand may provide personal information to us so we can create user accounts for their students. In addition, employers may provide us with personal information and other background data on their job applicants so we can assist with their employment recruitment process.  If you provide personal information about a third party, then you expressly represent and warrant to Firsthand that you have the full right and lawful authority to provide Firsthand with the information.</p><p> </p><ol><li><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></li></ol><p> </p><p>We use, process and retain your personal information to provide the Online Services, and to promote and defend our business interests.

As part of our Employer Profile surveys, you have an opportunity to provide us feedback about your workplace experience with a particular employer. Our editors consolidate, review, and analyze your feedback (and the survey results of other participants) and write a summary of these experiences within an Employer Profile on our Site. Firsthand editors may also select quotes from within your survey feedback to include as part of an Employer Profile. Please be aware that Employer Profiles, including your feedback therein, may be published to the general public and therefore you should avoid including in your feedback any personal information or other details that might compromise your own anonymity or that of any other individual.</p><p><em><u> </u></em></p><p><em><u>Employee/Intern Reviews</u></em>. For our Employee/Intern Review surveys, you have an opportunity to provide us feedback about your workplace experience with a particular employer and your feedback may be published within an Employer Review on our Site. Your feedback may be posted without any editorial review by us. In addition, you may register with Firsthand in order to submit reviews, insights, and opinions about your current or former employers or schools. In either case, while your name is not associated with a quotation or review, the review may be accompanied by general identifiers, where provided, such as office location, position/level, department, or year in which the survey was conducted. The review also identifies whether you are a “verified employee” or “verified intern” to indicate that the comment was collected through Firsthand’s survey process and distinguish it from other user-generated reviews.</p><p><em><u> </u></em></p><p><em><u>Blog Posts, Career Advice, and Other Forums</u></em>. Firsthand may use anonymous comments and/or aggregated scores provided to our surveys for the purposes of publishing blog posts or articles; making presentations; or participating in public or private forums or other discussions on employee satisfaction, perceptions of employers, and industry trends.</p><p><em><u> </u></em></p><p><em><u>Research Reports</u></em>. Firsthand may use aggregated and de-identified data from our surveys for the purposes of client research, to help employers benchmark employers against the industry and their peers and/or to gauge relative levels of satisfaction among their own employees. In the event these research reports include the survey’s text feedback, Firsthand reviews and edits, as necessary, such feedback to seek to minimize the personal information associated with your comments. However, you should be aware that their comments may be published or used for research and avoid including details that might compromise their anonymity.</p><p> </p><ol><li><strong>Sharing Your Personal Information With Others</strong></li></ol><p> </p><p>We do not sell, lease, or rent your personal information to a third party for profit or other valuable consideration.
