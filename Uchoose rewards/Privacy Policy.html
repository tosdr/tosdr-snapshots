	<p>This uChoose Rewards<sup>&reg;</sup> Program Privacy Notice (the &#8220;Privacy Notice&#8221;) describes how your personal data is handled and the rights and choices available to you in connection with the uChoose Rewards&reg; Program and its associated fulfillment services (collectively, the &#8220;Program&#8221;). Fiserv Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;Fiserv&#8221; or &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is providing the Program on behalf of your financial institution, and the information in this Privacy Notice is intended to supplement privacy information that was previously provided to you by your financial institution. [In addition, please also refer to the &#8220;Terms & Conditions&#8221; found on the Program&#8217;s website for more information about your rights and obligations with respect to other issues.] </p>
	<p>Fiserv and your financial institution provide separate privacy notices that apply to other products or services, in which case this Privacy Notice does not apply. Where this Privacy Notice applies, we also may provide additional or supplemental privacy notices to individuals at the time we collect their data, which will govern how we may process the information provided at that time. </p>
