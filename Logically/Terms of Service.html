<h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
<p id="collection-of-information"><strong>What’s covered in these terms</strong></p>
<p>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Logically services, and what we expect from you.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Logically’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Logically’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
<li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
<li>Content in Logically services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Logically or others</li>
<li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
</ul>
<p id="service-provider">Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.</p>
<p>Besides these terms, we also publish a <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, and Logically Intelligence Terms of Service.</p>
<h4>Service provider</h4>
<p>Logically services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:</p>
<p>TheLogically Ltd.</p>
<p>Incorporated and operating under the laws of England and Wales</p>
<p id="age-requirements">Brookfoot Mills <br>Elland Road, West Yorkshire <br>HD62RW <br>UK</p>
<h4>Age requirements</h4>
<p>If you’re under the age required to manage your own Logically Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Logically Account. Please ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you.</p>
<p id="your-relationship-with-logically">If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.</p>
<h4>Your relationship with Logically</h4>
<p id="what-you-can-expect-from-us">These terms help define the relationship between you and Logically. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Logically’s business works and how we earn money. When we speak of 'Logically', 'we', 'us' and 'our', we mean TheLogically Ltd. and its affiliates.</p>
<h4 id="provide-a-broad-range-of-useful-services">What you can expect from us</h4>
<p>Provide a broad range of useful services</p>
<p>We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:</p>
<ul id="improve-logically-services">
<li>apps and sites (such as Logically)</li>
<li>platforms (such as Logically Intelligence)</li>
<li>integrated services (such as Fact-checking embedded in other companies' apps or sites)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improve Logically services</h4>
<p>We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block problematic content, and to provide you with innovative features like credibility assessment. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.</p>
<p>We maintain a rigorous product research programme, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.</p>
<p id="what-we-expect-from-you">If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements or addressing security and operability issues.</p>
<h4 id="follow-these-terms-and-service-specific-additional-terms">What we expect from you</h4>
<p>Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms</p>
<p>The permission that we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in these terms and Logically Intelligence Terms.</p>
<p id="respect-others">We also make various policies, Help Centres and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Transparency Policy and other pages accessible from our site.</p>
<p>Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in the services.</p>
<h4>Respect others</h4>
<p>Some of our services may allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means that you must follow these basic rules of conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions and human trafficking laws</li>
<li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>
<li>don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) – for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing or stalking others</li>
<li id="permission-to-use-your-content">don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse directly or by emailing us on contact@logically.ai..</p>
<h4>Permission to use your content</h4>
<p id="licence">Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure that you have that the content is lawful.</p>
<h4>Licence</h4>
<p id="whats-covered">Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content that you make, such as reviews that you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.</p>
<p>We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Logically with that permission through this licence.</p>
<h4 id="whats-not-covered">What's covered</h4>
<p>This licence covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>
<h4>What’s not covered</h4>
<ul>
<li>This licence doesn’t affect your data protection rights – it’s only about your intellectual property rights</li>
<li>This licence doesn’t cover these types of content:
<ul id="scope">
<li>publicly available information that you provide. That information doesn’t require a licence because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.</li>
<li>feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>This licence is:</p>
<ul id="rights">
<li>worldwide, which means that it’s valid anywhere in the world</li>
<li>non-exclusive, which means that you can license your content to others</li>
<li>royalty-free, which means that there are no fees for this licence</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rights</h4>
<p>This licence allows Logically to:</p>
<ul>
<li>host, reproduce, distribute, communicate and use your content – for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere that you go</li>
<li>publish, publicly perform or publicly display your content</li>
<li>modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it</li>
<li>sublicense these rights to:
<ul id="purpose">
<li>other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people that you choose</li>
<li>our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This licence is for the limited purpose of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>operating and improving the services</strong>, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyse your content.</li>
<li id="duration">This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received and when it is stored.</li>
<li><strong>using content that you’ve shared publicly to promote the services</strong>. For example, to promote a Logically app, we might quote a review that you wrote.</li>
<li><strong>developing new technologies and services</strong> for Logically consistent with these terms</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-logically-services">Duration</h4>
<p id="your-logically-account">This licence lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>
<h4>Using Logically services</h4>
<p>Your Logically Account</p>
<p id="using-logically-services-on-behalf-of-an-organisation-or-business">If you meet these age requirements you can create a Logically Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Logically Account in order to work – for example, you require an account to use our app and fact-checking service, but do not require it to access our website.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for what you do with your Logically Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Logically Account secure.</p>
<h4>Using Logically services on behalf of an organisation or business</h4>
<p>Many organisations, such as businesses, non-profits and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organisation:</p>
<ul id="service-related-communications">
<li>an authorised representative of that organisation must agree to these terms and the terms set out here. [Link to logically intelligence terms]</li>
<li>your organisation’s administrator may assign a Logically Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Logically Account.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Service-related communications</h4>
<p id="content-in-logically-services">To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Logically’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p id="your-content">If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.</p>
<h4>Content in Logically services</h4>
<p>Your content</p>
<p>Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available – for example, you might post a claim in our apps, or share content on the shadow open network in our browser extensions.</p>
<ul id="logically-content">
<li>See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think that someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement via email to legal@logically.ai and we’ll take appropriate action.</p>
<h4>Logically content</h4>
<p id="other-content">Some of our services include content that belongs to Logically – for example, most of the factchceks illustrations that you see in our apps and sites. You may use Logically’s content for non-commercial and non-institutional purposes as allowed by these terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure or alter any of our branding, logos or legal notices.</p>
<h4>Other content</h4>
<p id="software-in-logically-services">Finally, some of our services gives you access to content that belongs to other people or organisations – for example, a newspaper article displayed in Logically apps. You may not use this content without that person or organisation’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in the content of other people or organisations are their own, and don’t necessarily reflect Logically’s views.</p>
<h4>Software in Logically services</h4>
<p>Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.</p>
<p>The licence we give you is:</p>
<ul>
<li>worldwide, which means that it's valid anywhere in the world</li>
<li>non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others</li>
<li>royalty-free, which means that there are no fees for this licence</li>
<li>personal, which means that it doesn't extend to anyone else</li>
<li>non-assignable, which means that you're not allowed to assign the licence to anyone else</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.</p>
<p id="in-case-of-problems-or-disagreements">When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>
<h4>In case of problems or disagreements</h4>
<p>Warranty</p>
<p id="disclaimers">We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.</p>
<h4>Disclaimers</h4>
<p id="liabilities">The only commitments that we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.</p>
<h4>Liabilities</h4>
<p>For all users</p>
<p>These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t limit Logically’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
<p id="for-business-users-and-organisations-only">Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (in case of problems or disagreements), Logically won’t be responsible for any other losses.</p>
<h4>For business users and organisations only</h4>
<p>If you’re a business user or organisation, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll indemnify Logically and its directors, officers, employees and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or additional terms outlined by the Logically Intelligence Terms of Service. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs and legal fees.</li>
<li>Logically won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
<ul>
<li>loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill or anticipated savings</li>
<li>indirect or consequential loss</li>
<li>punitive damages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logically’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) £500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach</li>
</ul>
<p id="taking-action-in-case-of-problems">If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.</p>
<h4>Taking action in case of problems</h4>
<p>Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:</p>
<ul>
<li>cause harm or liability to a user, third party or Logically</li>
<li id="removing-your-content">violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order</li>
<li>compromise an investigation</li>
<li>compromise the operation, integrity or security of our services</li>
</ul>
<h4>Removing your content</h4>
<p id="suspending-or-terminating-your-access-to-logically-services">If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties or Logically, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<h4>Suspending or terminating your access to Logically services</h4>
<p>Logically reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Logically Account if any of these things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>you materially or repeatedly breach these terms</li>
<li>we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order</li>
<li>we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party or Logically – for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you. Unauthorised scraping of content from Logically services may lead to a penalty of upto £100 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that your Logically Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.</p>
<p id="settling-disputes-governing-law-and-courts">Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.</p>
<h4>Settling disputes, governing law and courts</h4>
<p>For information about how to contact Logically, please visit our contact page.</p>
<p id="about-these-terms">If you’re a resident of, or an organisation based in the United Kingdom, these terms and your relationship with Logically under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by English law, and you can file legal disputes in the English courts.</p>
<h4>About these terms</h4>
<p>By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these Terms of Service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>
<p>These terms describe the relationship between you and Logically. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organisations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p>
<p>We want to make these terms easy to understand. But not all the services mentioned may be available to you or in your country.</p>
<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
<p>If you don’t follow these terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.</p>
<p>We may update these terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business – for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory or security reasons or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.</p>
<p id="logically-intelligence-terms-and-conditions">If we materially change these terms, we'll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don't agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Logically Account.</p>

<h3>Logically Intelligence Terms and Conditions</h3>
<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>TheLogically Ltd., a company incorporated in England and Wales (“<strong>Logically</strong>”) operates the website located at www.logically.ai, and any other websites owned or operated by Logically or its affiliates that link to these Terms and Conditions (each, a “<strong>Site</strong>”, and collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”). The Logically service, available through our Site, APIs (if API access is provided) and mobile applications, is an online platform (the “<strong>Platform</strong>”) that provides companies, and individuals (each, a “<strong>Client</strong>” ), access to and use of the Site and its services, with certain media monitoring, media intelligence, credibility assessment, veracity assessment and social network investigation services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>” ). These Terms and Conditions, along with the Service Order Form (as defined below), if any, and any additional documents referenced therein (collectively, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>” ), set forth the entire agreement regarding the use of the Services between you, as the Client, and Logically. In case of a conflict between the terms of a Service Order Form and these Terms and Conditions, the terms of the Service Order Form shall control. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Site. All such additional guidelines, terms, and rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. As used herein, a “<strong>Service Order Form</strong>” means a document, either physical or electronic, signed by both parties identifying the Services to be made available to Client by Logically pursuant to this Agreement. The Service Order Form shall specify the Term of authorized use of the Services, the Fees and other charges for the Services, any special payment terms, the scope of use, the permitted Usage Levels.</p>
