<h4 id="what-personal-data" class="privacy-headings">1. What personal data do we process about you and where do we get it?</h4>
<h5>When you use our Website and/or otherwise contact Logically</h5>
<p>When visiting our Website, you may sign up to be provided with information about our products and services, request product information and/or make an enquiry through our online contact form or otherwise contact us directly, for example by phone or email. We will process any personal data you provide to us, such as your contact details (such as name, email address and/or phone number) and any other information you include in your enquiries or submissions.</p>
<p>We will also automatically collect the following information each time you visit the Website: browser type and version, how long you spend on a page and on our Website, type of device, screen resolution, operating system and interface, your domain name, if applicable, the website from which you are visiting us (referrer URL), webpage(s) you are visiting on our Website, the date and time of accessing our Website, and your internet protocol (IP) address.</p>
<h5>When you publish information and/or posts on social media and other publicly available websites</h5>
<p>Logically’s mission is to reduce and eventually eliminate the harms associated with mis- and disinformation. Logically therefore scans social media platforms and other sites to detect these harms and other potential threats. By virtue of the provision of some of our services to our customers or to develop our products and services, Logically may be processing your personal data, which you have published on the internet. Some of our products and services involve us ingesting large volumes of data sourced from social platforms and other websites. This means that we may, for example, process your personal data from your social media profile such as name, username, photograph, demographic information such as interests or gender, geolocation information, employment information, audio/visual information you post or interact with or the content of your posts. If your social media posts or the information you publish on a publicly available website contains personal data then we may process this as well, for example if you include personal data about yourself in a Twitter post. We use this information to identity emerging threats, including disinformation campaigns, produce reports, conduct fact-checking exercises.</p>
<h5>Sensitive personal data</h5>
<p>Some of the personal data that we process may be deemed sensitive under data protection laws, such as the UK GDPR. For example, we may process personal data relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, health data or data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation. We will only process sensitive categories of personal data about you where this is authorised by data protection laws. This will be the case where we process this type of personal data about you because you have made it public by virtue of processing data from social media platforms or other websites. For example, if you reveal your political opinions in a publicly available Facebook post.</p>
<h5>When we do business with our customers, suppliers and business partners</h5>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, Logically may collect and process personal data concerning our customers, suppliers, investors and business partners (and their representatives), such as name, contact details (for example, email address, telephone number, residential address), job title and employer-related information and other business- related information that you or your employer make available to us. We may also receive your personal data from distributors to incentivise sales and from other third parties who provide business development services to us.</p>
<h5>When you participate in our events, including webinars and video conferences</h5>
<p>We may collect personal data such as your name, job function/title, the company name of your employer, contact details (such as email address and phone number), the country and city where you are based, photos with your likeness, voice and/or video recordings, as part of registration and in the course of training events, meetings, conferences and other events we may organize and information about attendance at such events. We may receive some of this personal data from third parties if they help us organize these events or co-organise them with us.</p>

<h4 id="international-transfers" class="privacy-headings">4. International transfers of personal data</h4>
<h5>Intra-Group</h5>

Where such international data transfers take place, such as to Logically entities in the US or India, it will be on the basis of an appropriate safeguard approved by the Information Commissioner’s Office (<strong>“ICO”</strong>) and/or EU Commission, such as the ICO’s international data transfer addendum and the EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses.</p>

In these cases, we require you to inform that person that you will be sharing their personal data with us and the purposes for which you will share it. Please provide them with a link to or copy of this Policy and our contact details. Please also let them know that they should contact us if they have any additional questions about how we will use their personal data.</p>

<h5>Rectification</h5>
<p>You may have the right to request the rectification of inaccurate personal data and to have incomplete data completed.</p>
<h5>Objection</h5>
<p>Where we process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to this processing for reasons relating to your particular situation. If this is the case, we will stop this processing of your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling reasons why we need to process it, which override your rights and freedoms or where we need to process it for the purposes of legal claims. Where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you may have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for this at any time.</p>
<h5>Portability</h5>
<p>You may have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit it to other data controllers without hindrance. This right only exists if the processing is based on your consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
<h5>Restriction</h5>
<p>You may request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain cases, (so that we must suspend the processing, except for storage, with your consent or for legal claims) including for example where you object to us processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests or where you want to establish the accuracy or the reason we are processing your personal data.</p>
<h5>Erasure</h5>
<p>You may request to erase your personal data if (i) it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we have collected it, (ii) you have withdrawn your consent and no other legal ground for the processing exists, (iii) you objected and no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing exist, or (iv) the processing is unlawful, or erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation.</p>

<p>Please be aware that not all of these rights are absolute and that there may be situations in which you cannot exercise them or they are not relevant.</p>
<h4 id="automated-decision-making" class="privacy-headings">8. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<p><span>In order to provide its services to its clients, Logically may engage in automated decision- making and profiling. For example, identifying Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour (CIB) patterns that assist analyst workflows to investigate narratives. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<p><span>You have certain rights in relation to this type of processing, including the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions, including profiling. For more information about your rights, please see section 7. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="do-we-use-cookies" class="privacy-headings">9. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h4>
<p>The Website uses cookies and other tracking technologies. Additionally, our email marketing messages may contain tracking beacons, tracked clickable links or similar server technologies in order to track subscriber activity within email marketing messages. Where used, such technologies may record or collect a range of subscriber data relating to engagement, geographic location, demographics and already stored subscriber data.</p>
<p>For further information about our use of cookies and similar technologies, please read our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h4 id="data-security" class="privacy-headings">10. Data security</h4>
<p>We use encryption (HTTPS/SSL) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, it is important to note that data transmission over the Internet is never 100% secure. You should therefore take reasonable measures to ensure your account is secured. You use our services at your own risk, and you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.</p>
<h4 id="third-party" class="privacy-headings">11. Third party embeds, third party links, downloads and media files</h4>
<p>Logically often uses content hosted on other sites (such as articles and videos from news publications). This content is not hosted by Logically and therefore these files send data back to the hosted site as if you were visiting that site directly. Logically cannot control the data or what is done with the data collected from third parties in these cases, therefore third party embeds on Logically services are not covered by this Policy.</p>
<p>Embeds may request your personal information through forms (for example: they may ask for your email address). In choosing to give your personal information to a third party, the third party may process your personal data. This Policy does not cover what third parties do with the information you choose to provide them so please ensure you have read and understand the third party's privacy policy prior to submitting any personal information through a third party form.</p>
<p>Any downloadable documents, files or media made available on this Website are provided to you at your own risk. While all precautions have been undertaken to ensure only genuine downloads are available, we advise you to verify their authenticity using third party anti-virus software or similar applications. We accept no responsibility for third party downloads and downloads provided by external third party websites and similarly advise you to verify their authenticity using third party anti-virus software or similar applications.</p>
