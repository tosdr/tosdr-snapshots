This is Your sole and exclusive remedy for any Infringement Claim.</li><li><strong>ASC’s</strong> indemnification obligation will not apply: (a) if the Service is modified by You, without ASC’s consent; (b) if the Service is combined with other products, applications, or processes not authorized by Us, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; or (c) to any unauthorized use of the Service.</li><li><strong>Indemnification by You.</strong> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Us harmless, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) Your use, Users’ use, and unauthorized use of the Service; (ii) a third-party claim, suit or proceeding that the use of the Customer Data or Your artifacts within the scope of this Agreement infringes any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party; (iii) claim, suit or proceeding or penalty alleging that the distribution of the Customer Data or Your artifacts within the scope of this Agreement infringes any applicable export laws or regulations.</li><li><strong>Indemnification Process.</strong> In the event a claim is brought against a party hereto (the “Indemnifying Party”), the Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) shall promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with a written notice of the claim, provided that, a failure to provide such notification shall only excuse the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party to the extent it was materially prejudiced thereby. Neither Party, as the case may be, shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to any Claim without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the above, ASC may enter into a settlement without Your consent, to the extent the only obligation associated with You thereunder is of monetary nature.</li><li><strong>Generative AI. </strong>Certain features of the Service utilize generative AI tools, including without limitation Azure OpenAI, Google Cloud Platform, Anthropic, and IBM.
