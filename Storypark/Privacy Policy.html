Trans-border Personal Data flows</h3><p>Storypark’s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited information about adult individuals (including customers) is transferred and /or stored there. In respect of our responsibilities under the GDPR, the appropriate safeguard in place for such a transfer is the existence of an adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR. <br/><br/>The vast majority of Personal Data we handle is stored and hosted in Australia. <strong>All Personal Data relating to Children on Storypark is hosted in Australia. <br/><br/>‍</strong>Some limited Personal Data may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Service (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser). Third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us. <br/><br/>In respect of the transfer of Personal Data to Australia, the USA and other countries, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from any third parties that they will safeguard personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable Data Protection Laws.
