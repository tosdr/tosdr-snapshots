We provide the venue; but the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed and sold directly by independent third-party sellers, so Mercari cannot and does not make any warranties about items’ quality, safety or legality.

  <li class="tos">Mercari will make refunds or other payments owed to you, as required by applicable law or regulation.</li>
  <li class="tos">Accounts that are abandoned or balances that are unclaimed are subject to state abandoned property regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10">10. Buying and Selling Generally</h3>
<p><strong>Prohibited Transactions.</strong> When buying a product using the Service, in addition to the limitations in our <a href="/us/help_center/topics/listing/policies/prohibited-items">Prohibited Items</a> and <a href="/us/help_center/topics/account/policies/prohibited-conduct">Prohibited Conduct</a> policies, Buyers also must not place orders without the intent to purchase, or place any order that is determined by Mercari to be fraudulent or illegal. You agree that the Service may only be used for bona fide purchases of goods, and may not be used to transfer money between a Buyer and Seller that is unrelated to a purchase of goods.</p>
<p>A Seller shall not purchase a product they themselves have listed on a separate Account. A Seller who wishes to withdraw or remove a listing must do so per the procedures specified in the Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Sales Contract.</strong> A sales contract for a product is formed with the Seller when the Buyer completes the steps for purchasing a product as prompted on the Service, but before payment is made by the Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer may not assign to a third party, provide as security, or otherwise dispose of their rights and obligations arising under such sales contract.</p>
<p><strong>Mercari’s Role.</strong> Users agree that Mercari and its payment processor act as agents for the User in processing payments for purchases. A Buyer’s obligation to a Seller for the purchase price shall be deemed satisfied upon receipt by Mercari of the purchase price  (except for Buyer’s obligations in the event of a payment dispute or reversal) and rating.</p>
<p>Once a product has been received by a Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly rate the Seller. Once the Buyer has rated the Seller, the Seller shall promptly rate the Buyer. Ratings need to be provided by the Buyer and the Seller in order for the Seller to receive their earnings. If the Buyer does not rate the Seller by the designated time, a rating will be assigned to the Seller to avoid delay in payment completion. This automated rating releases the payment to the Seller.</p>
<p><strong>Settlement to Sellers.</strong> When ratings by both a Buyer and a Seller are complete, Mercari and its designated payment processor will process the payment to Seller. Mercari will make commercially reasonable efforts to credit Seller’s earnings balance with Mercari within ten (10) business days of receipt of the settled payment proceeds. Mercari shall initiate the transfer of balance earnings to Seller’s bank account at Seller’s request using Direct Deposit or Instant Pay. Mercari may request additional User Information to help ensure the transfer and purchase is secure, and may retain the earnings until User Information has been verified. </p>
<p>For more information on buying and selling please refer to our Help Center.</p>

<h3 id="11">11. Fees Generally</h3>
<p><strong>Transaction Fees.</strong> The fees that we charge Users for the use of our Services are listed on our <a href="https://www.mercari.com/us/help_center/article/169/">Fees page</a>. We may change our fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Mercari site in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.</p>

<p><strong>Taxes.</strong> Taxes. When you purchase an item, taxes may apply to your purchase. Such taxes may vary depending on various factors, including: (i) the price of the item, (ii) the nature and character of the item, (iii) and the delivery location of the item. Applicable taxes will be displayed to Buyers before commitment to purchase. See Mercari’s <a href="https://www.mercari.com/us/help_center/article/465/">Sales Tax Policy</a> for additional information.</p>

<h3 id="12">12. Payments</h3>
<p>Mercari processes transactions on behalf of the Seller, and Buyer authorizes Seller to submit charges or credits (in the case of refunds/reversals), as applicable, to the Buyer’s Payment Instrument on file. Payments made in connection with the Service shall be made through Mercari using its payments processing providers.</p>
<p>Purchases made by the User’s Payment Instrument through the Service are subject to the terms and conditions between Buyer and the issuer (bank) of the Payment Instrument.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you authorize Mercari and/or its payment processor to charge or debit your designated Payment Instrument, as applicable, when you make transactions or if you incur additional fees or amounts owed to Mercari for the Service(s). All associated fees will be shown on the purchase receipt.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the sale, Seller earnings, minus any applicable charges, will settle in the Sellers account. Fees associated with the sale will be provided on the sales receipt</p>

<h3 id="13">13. Cancelation of a Transaction; Refunds</h3>
<p>Generally, cancelation of a transaction is not permitted once the product has been ordered by a Buyer, except as required by applicable law or regulation. Mercari may also cancel a transaction due to potential risk factors, including, but not limited to, precautionary measures that are risk related or to ensure the safety of our platform.</p>
<p>See Mercari’s <a href="/us/help_center/topics/returns/policies/refunds-and-returns">Refunds &amp; Returns Policy</a> for additional information.</p>

<h3 id="14">14. Redeeming and Using Earnings; Earnings Limitations</h3>
<p>After a transaction is complete, the goods have been delivered to the Buyer, and both the Buyer and the Seller have rated the transaction, the Seller may use the earnings balance from the sale to:</p>
<ul class="tos">
  <li class="tos">Deposit in their bank account by requesting a Direct Deposit;</li>
  <li class="tos">Enroll in Instant Pay and request a direct-to-debit card withdrawal; or</li>
  <li class="tos">Use the earnings balance to purchase goods on Mercari.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mercari and/or its banks or processors may impose additional limitations on the dollar amount or frequency of bank deposits or use of earnings; these limitations are subject to change without notice. Mercari limits Instant Pay to $600 total per month until you meet certain conditions, including completing verification of User Information.</p>
<p>A Seller whose User Information has not been verified and confirmed by Mercari may not complete a sale through the Service that would result in an Account earnings balance more than $1,900 (one thousand nine hundred dollars) in any 24 hour period, as calculated by Mercari at its discretion. Other account limitations requiring user verification may vary based on state specific requirements, may relate to tax inquiries and/or fraud related issues and may require verification or other documentation before Mercari will release earnings. Sellers who successfully verify their identity increase their balance limits and other transactional thresholds on their Mercari Account.</p>

<h3 id="15">15. Transaction Records, Receipts and Customer Service</h3>
<p>Receipts may not be issued to Users for payments made or received on the Service, except as required by applicable law or regulation.</p>

A receipt will also be sent to the email address you provided on your Account. You are responsible for reviewing your payment transaction history to determine if there are any errors or unauthorized transactions, and for immediately alerting Mercari via email at contact@mercari.com or by calling the 1-800 number listed on your receipts and Mercari Account statements.</p>
<p>It is your obligation to print or save a copy of your transaction history if desired. Please refer to the <a href="/us/help_center/topics/trust/policies/electronic-communication-policy">Electronic Communications Policy</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting any issues directly to Mercari through various contact us options in the Help Center, residents of certain states may have rights regarding concerns or complaints with our payment services.

<p>Returns of prohibited items to Sellers are not allowed. Buyers may be eligible for a refund after the goods have been confirmed destroyed. Sellers will not be reimbursed for prohibited items.</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between Users, or between a User and a third party with regard to the Service, the matter shall be resolved by such Users at their own cost. Mercari may participate in the dispute at its discretion. After a transaction is processed, Mercari is the final arbiter of disputes between Users and Mercari shall not bear any liability related to such disputes. Buyer Accounts may be closed for filing a chargeback without first filing a dispute against the Seller through the Mercari Help Center, or for filing false chargebacks.</p>
<p>If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release Mercari and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."</p>

<h3 id="20">20. Indemnification; Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>We hope this never happens, but if Mercari gets sued because of an action you took using our Service, you agree to indemnify us and assist in defending Mercari to the best of your ability. That means you must assist Mercari in defending any matter in which you were involved by providing information related to the experience. You must hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that may arise from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Service, your breach of the Terms, or your Account’s infringement of someone else’s rights.</p>
<p><strong>Liability Limits.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Mercari, nor our employees or directors shall be liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential, incidental, actual, indirect, special or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the Service or these Terms. In no event shall Mercari’s aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater of one hundred ($100) U.S. Dollars or the amount you paid Mercari in the past twelve months for use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnity.</strong> You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend and indemnify Mercari from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of, the Service; (ii) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (iv) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim.</p>

MERCARI DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (I) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (II) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE.</p>
<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE, YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE, AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE), OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THAT MATERIAL OR CONTENT.</p>
<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>MERCARI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUMENT INFORMATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WHETHER SUCH INFORMATION IS UP-TO-DATE. MERCARI HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF YOUR OR ANOTHER USER’S PAYMENT INSTRUMENT IS IN GOOD STANDING OR IF YOU OR ANOTHER USER HAVE AN AVAILABLE BALANCE WITH WHICH TO MAKE A TRANSACTION THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU MAY INCUR FEES, SUCH AS OVERDRAFT FEES OR OTHER CHARGES AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, PER YOUR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PAYMENT INSTRUMENT ISSUER, OR YOUR REQUESTED TRANSACTION THROUGH THE SERVICE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT WILL MERCARI BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT MERCARI HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MERCARI TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (I) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO MERCARI FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM; OR (II) $100.</p>
<p>FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO TRANSFERS OF FUNDS FROM YOUR MERCARI ACCOUNT BALANCE, THE SOLE REMEDY AGAINST MERCARI SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE MONEY TO BE TRANSMITTED PLUS FEES AND CHARGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL MERCARI BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES FOR DELAY, NON DELIVERY, NONPAYMENT OR UNDERPAYMENT OF A PAYMENT TRANSACTION, WHETHER CAUSED BY AN ACT OR OMISSION OF MERCARI OR OTHERWISE, OR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION.</p>
<p>MERCARI SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR SUSPENDING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT, RESTRICTING ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR BALANCES IN YOUR ACCOUNT, OR SUSPENDING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>MERCARI SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR SUSPENDING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT, RESTRICTING ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR BALANCES IN YOUR ACCOUNT, OR SUSPENDING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Mercari shall have no liability for failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to governmental action, war or acts of terrorism; acts of nature including earthquakes, fire, flood or other acts of God; pandemics, labor conditions; power failures and/or internet disturbances.</p>

<h3 id="21">21. Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul class="tos">
  <li class="tos">These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchisee relationship between you and Mercari.</li>
  <li class="tos">The Terms, including the Policies and other documents incorporated by reference herein, supersede any other agreement between you and Mercari regarding the Service.</li>
  <li class="tos">If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</li>
  <li class="tos">Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms.</li>
  <li class="tos">The Terms will remain in effect even after your access to the Service is terminated, or your use of the Service ends.</li>
  <li class="tos">You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms, or any of our rights and obligations under the Terms, at any time without consent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notice</strong></p>
<p>If Mercari determines that there is a need to notify or contact a User, it will do so by sending a text message, email, or letter to the email address or mailing address provided by the User. Alternatively, the notice may be displayed on the App or the website, or by other reasonable means. Mercari shall not be liable for any damages incurred due to the fact that Mercari’s notice or communication was not received or was delayed.</p>
<p>You may print or download our policies. If you are a California resident, you may also have these Terms sent to you electronically by emailing us a request for these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>
<p>In general, items purchased by, and shipped to, Buyers in U.S. locations and charges for shipping and other fees may be subject to applicable Transaction Taxes (“Taxes”).Taxes are not included in the listed price for any item(s) listed by Sellers; rather Taxes will be separately stated and added to the order total during checkout, if applicable.</p>
<p>Tax amounts may vary based on a few factors such as the nature of the item(s) purchased, the delivery location and the tax rate in effect at the time of the transaction. The tax rate is a combined rate based on the total state and local rates of the location where the item is delivered. Mercari will collect Taxes from Buyers on behalf of Sellers where required, specifically in those states that require marketplaces to collect Taxes on behalf of Sellers. The collected Tax amounts will be reported by Mercari and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of Sellers. Sellers are responsible for any and all Taxes except to the extent Mercari chooses or is required to calculate, collect, report and remit such Transaction Taxes according to applicable law.</p>
<p>If you qualify for an exemption from sales tax, Mercari will accept valid tax exemption documentation entitling such exemption holders to purchase on Mercari without paying sales tax. Refer to our <a href="/us/help_center/article/465/">Sales Tax Policy</a> for information on how to submit your tax exemption documentation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Buyers may be able to receive a credit for sales tax paid to Mercari directly from your state. Please consult a tax advisor or your state Department of Revenue as policies differ for each state.</p>
<p>You hereby agree to comply with any and all applicable tax laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, including reporting and payment of any taxes arising from a payment transaction or income received through sales made through the Service. For more information see our <a href="/us/help_center/article/465">Sales Tax Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>W-9 and 1099-K Reporting</strong></p>

  <li class="tos">Mercari may request certain information from you to comply with IRS and state reporting requirements, including but not limited to, completing W-9 taxpayer identification forms and submitting 1099-K sales reports when required to facilitate Mercari’s Tax obligations at federal and state levels.</li>
  <li class="tos">Depending on the information submitted on the W-9 form, we may request additional information related to you, your business, or your previous submissions to Mercari. Failure to provide accurate and timely information may result in limitations being placed on your Account. For more Information see our <a href="/us/help_center/topics/account/policies/1099-k-reporting-policy-and-disclosure-information">1099-K Reporting Policy and Disclosure Information</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<ul class="tos">
  <li class="tos">These Terms shall be governed and construed under the laws of California. Any dispute that arises between you and Mercari that may not be subject to arbitration and shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Complaint Notices</strong></p>
<ul class="tos">
  <li class="tos">If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1789.3 allows you to contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210, in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Service or to receive further information regarding use of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="22">22. <a id="TOS_22">Legal Disputes and Use of Arbitration</a></h3>
<p>You and Mercari each agree that any and all disputes or claims at law or equity that have arisen or may arise between you and Mercari relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of these Terms, your use of or access to the Service, any goods sold, offered, or purchased through the Service, or any payments processed for goods sold, offered or purchased through the Service, SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, rather than through other legal proceedings in court, except that you may assert a claim in small claims court, if it meets the criteria for such. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit filed in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to limited review by courts. You and Mercari agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Article.</p>

<p><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></p>
<p>YOU AND MERCARI AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MERCARI AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> The assigned independent arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this or any other applicable Terms or Policies, any part thereof, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.</p>

<p>All arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (<a href="https://adr.org/consumer">https://adr.org/consumer</a>) in effect at the time of the filing of the demand for arbitration, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable). The AAA’s rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must also send a copy of the completed form to Mercari at the following address in order to initiate arbitration proceedings: Mercari, Inc. Attn: Legal PO Box 60178, Palo Alto, CA 94306.</p>

<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Mercari User to the extent required by applicable law or regulation. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings.</strong> You and Mercari agree that these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings (in addition to the Arbitration Procedures above) shall apply if you choose to participate in a Multiple Case Filing. If 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against Mercari by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“Multiple Case Filing”), the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. You and Mercari agree that as part of these procedures, the parties’ counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and the AAA’s resources.</p>

<p>If your claim is part of a Multiple Case Filing, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled for your claim from the time that your dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this provision.</p>

<p>STAGE ONE: If at least 50 disputes are submitted as part of the Multiple Case Filing, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Mercari shall each select 25 disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. The number of disputes to be selected to proceed in Stage One can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 50 disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). Each of the 50 (or fewer) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One), and Mercari shall pay the mediator’s fee.</p>

<p>STAGE TWO: If the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Mercari shall each select 40 disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process. The number of disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 80 disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). No more than five cases may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage Two. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining disputes with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two), and Mercari shall pay the mediator’s fee.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn shall be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.</p>

<p>The Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, either an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.</p>

<p><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. For claims under $10,000, Mercari will reimburse you for all arbitration fees, including the initial filing fee, if you are deemed the prevailing party by the arbitrator.</p>

<p><strong>Severability.</strong> With the exception of any of the provisions in these Terms identified in the next sentence, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in this Article 22 ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") or ("Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings”) is invalid or unenforceable as to you, then the entirety of this Article 22 shall be null and void as to you.</p>

<p><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong></p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS ARTICLE ("OPT-OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO MERCARI, INC., PO BOX 60178, PALO ALTO, CA 94306.</p>

If 25 or more similar disputes (including yours) are asserted against Mercari by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“Multiple Case Filing”), the resolution of your dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. You and Mercari agree that as part of these procedures, the parties’ counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and the AAA’s resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your claim is part of a Multiple Case Filing, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled for your claim from the time that your dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSTAGE ONE: If at least 50 disputes are submitted as part of the Multiple Case Filing, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Mercari shall each select 25 disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. The number of disputes to be selected to proceed in Stage One can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 50 disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). Each of the 50 (or fewer) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One), and Mercari shall pay the mediator’s fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSTAGE TWO: If the remaining disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Mercari shall each select 40 disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process. The number of disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 80 disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). No more than five cases may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage Two. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining disputes with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two), and Mercari shall pay the mediator’s fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn shall be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, either an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosts of Arbitration\u003c/strong\u003e Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
