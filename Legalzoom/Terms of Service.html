<p><strong>6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND LEGALZOOM TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 6(g), BELOW. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. IN ADDITION, ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND LEGALZOOM FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(a) No Representative Actions. You and LegalZoom agree that any dispute or claim between us, including those arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, is personal to you and LegalZoom and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "LegalZoom," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers, business partners, shareholders, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us. Beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(b) Arbitration of Disputes</strong>. Most concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our Customer Care Center at (800) 773-0888. In the unlikely event that the LegalZoom Customer Care Center is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute you after attempting to do so informally), this Section 6 applies. Except for (i) individual actions in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or (ii) actions in court seeking injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, <strong>you and LegalZoom agree to waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us (collectively, âDisputesâ) resolved in court</strong>. Disputes include, but are not limited to, (a) those arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, and (b) those related to advertising, privacy, data security, and the use of our website. This Arbitration Agreement applies to all Disputes based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, Disputes arising before you accepted these or any prior Terms, Disputes that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class, and Disputes asserted against LegalZoom by those you list as authorized contacts on your order.</p>

<p><strong>(c) Arbitration Procedures</strong>. For any Dispute that you have against LegalZoom, or that LegalZoom has against you, you and LegalZoom agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute informally via the following process. If you assert a claim against LegalZoom, you will first contact LegalZoom by sending a written notice of your Dispute (â<strong>Claimant Notice</strong>â) to LegalZoom by U.S. certified mail addressed to Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, LegalZoom.com, Inc., 954 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041; a courtesy copy of the Notice should also be sent by email to legalnotice@legalzoom.com. The Claimant Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. For any Dispute that LegalZoom may have against you, we will provide you notice (â<strong>LegalZoom Notice</strong>â) in similar form to that described above via the mailing address and email address associated with your account. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for thirty (30) days from the date that either you or LegalZoom first send the applicable Notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute resolution process.</p>

<p>If you and LegalZoom cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after notice is provided, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) or, under the limited circumstances set forth herein, in court. All Disputes submitted to AAA will be resolved through binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Unless the parties agree in writing to a different location, arbitration proceedings will be held in Los Angeles County, CA; if you are a Consumer, however, you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence. For purposes of this Section 6, a â<strong>Consumer</strong>â means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes.</p>

<p>If you are a Consumer, you and LegalZoom agree to use the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. If you are not a Consumer, you and LegalZoom agree to use the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Expedited Procedures for all Disputes with a value of $75,000 or less. The most recent versions of the AAA Consumer and Commercial Arbitration Rules are available on the AAAâs website at <a href="http://adr.org/Rules">adr.org/Rules</a> and such rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Arbitration Agreement. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the applicable AAA Arbitration Rules or waive your opportunity to read the AAA Arbitration Rules and waive any claim that such rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

<p>You and LegalZoom acknowledge that the purpose of this Section 6 is to streamline the dispute resolution process and that Coordinated Filings are likely to frustrate that purpose. As a result, you agree not to assert a demand for arbitration as part of a Coordinated Filing. A âCoordinated Filingâ is any demand for arbitration where the underlying claim is similar to at least ten (10) or more other pending demands for arbitration and where representation for that demand is consistent or coordinated with such other demands. Without limiting any remedies, in the event your demand is part of a Coordinated Filing, we may, at our option, decline arbitration and instead litigate the claim in a civil court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of Section 19.</p>

<p><strong>(d) Individualized Arbitration Proceedings and Remedies</strong>. You and LegalZoom agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 6 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 1, et seq. (the â<strong>FAA</strong>â), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to grant any relief that would otherwise be available in court and to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute, including those arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion thereof. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individualâs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one claimant.</p>

<p><strong>(e) Confidentiality</strong>. The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. You and Legal Zoom agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and/or other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and LegalZoom agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, and/or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>(f) Payment of Arbitration Fees</strong>. The costs of arbitration shall be governed by the AAAâs fee schedules, available at <a href="http://adr.org/Rules">adr.org/Rules</a>. If you are a Consumer and you initiate arbitration of a Dispute, you agree to pay the applicable AAA Consumer Case Filing Fee, and LegalZoom will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. If you are not a Consumer and you initiate arbitration of a Dispute valued at less than $75,000, you agree to pay $250 towards any arbitration filing fees and LegalZoom will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. If you are not a Consumer and your arbitration proceeding is valued at $75,000 or more, you and LegalZoom will share equally the costs and fees of AAA Commercial Arbitration. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.</p>

<p><strong>(g) Opt Out of Arbitration. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 6 by sending, via U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Opt Out to LegalZoom. The Notice of Opt Out must be addressed to: Notice of Opt Out, General Counsel, LegalZoom.com, Inc., 954 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA, 94041; a courtesy copy of the Notice of Opt Out should also be sent by email to <a href="mailto:legalnotice@legalzoom.com">legalnotice@legalzoom.com</a></strong>. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 19, though, as stated above, you agree any such action will be brought as an individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>(h) Additional Terms</strong>. If any portion of this Section 6 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 6 or the partiesâ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 6; and (c) to the extent that any claims must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>

<p>If you wish to seek public injunctive relief against LegalZoom, such claim (and only such claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court in accordance with the provisions of Section 19.</p>

<p>You and LegalZoom agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award made pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
