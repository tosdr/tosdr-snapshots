<h2><strong>Where We Collect Personal Information</strong>    </h2>

<p>In this section of the Privacy Policy, we explain where and how we collect personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Customers</strong>: Much of the personal information that LegalZoom collects comes directly or indirectly from our customers and prospective customers.  Information that is collected directly from you is information that you provide when you complete a form online, upload a document, use a chat feature, or speak to us on the phone.  We may also collect information indirectly about you when you interact with our website, using cookies and other tracking technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Related Parties</strong>: We may collect information about you from someone you know.  For instance, if you are a shareholder in a business that is formed through LegalZoom, we may be given information about you by that business to complete the formation or to file Beneficial Ownership Reports.  We may also receive information about you from customers using our products to send communications to you, such as our e-signature product.  </p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may collect information about you from our Service Providers or other companies that we work with to deliver products to you.  As used in this Privacy Policy, Service Providers means entities that LegalZoom has contracted with to provide us with services to help fulfill our business needs.  An example of the type of information that we may receive from a Service Provider is information about whether any Legal Mail has been received as part of our Registered Agent services.  Service Providers may also assist us in collecting information both directly and indirectly from you.</p>

<p><strong>Professionals (including attorneys and Tax Experts)</strong>: We may receive information about you from the attorneys you work with through our Legal Plan or other product offerings.  LegalZoom does not intend to collect any information from attorneys where the collection would result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.  With your consent, and as described in the <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/legal/general-terms/lz-tax-privacy-policy">LZ Tax Privacy Policy</a>, we may also receive information about you from LZ Tax.</p>

<p><strong>Business Partners</strong>: We may receive information about you from our Business Partners.  As used in this Privacy Policy, Business Partners means entities that LegalZoom has contracted with to engage in cross-promotional or product integration activities.  An example of the type of information that we may receive from our business partners is information about the products you purchased from them.</p>

<p><strong>Affiliates and Subsidiaries</strong>: We may receive information about you from our affiliates and subsidiaries.  For example, if we acquire an ownership interest in a company, we may receive information about you as part of that acquisition if you have previously done business with them.</p>

<p><strong>Publicly/Commercially Available Information</strong>: We may collect information about you from publicly available sources of information, including government records, social media sites, and other commercially available sources of personal information.  Examples of the type of information we may collect from publicly available sources are whether your entity is in good standing with a Secretary of State or whether you have recently expressed interest in purchasing a product that LegalZoom sells.</p>

<p><strong>Unrelated Parties</strong>:  We may receive information related to you from people and entities with whom LegalZoom does not have a direct relationship.  An example of the type of information that we may receive from unrelated third parties are documents that we receive on your behalf in our role as your Registered Agent.</p>

<h2><strong>How We Use the Personal Information We Collect</strong></h2>

<p>In this section of the Privacy Policy, we explain our commercial and business purposes for collecting information.  LegalZoom uses the information that it collects for the purposes listed below.  We use technology, including automated processing, AI, and human review to accomplish these purposes.  We may also combine information that we have collected from multiple sources.</p>

<p>If we decide to use the personal information we have collected for additional purposes that are inconsistent with what is described below, we will let you know of our plans and give you information about your legal rights regarding your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Product Development</strong>: We use personal information for product development, including improving our existing offerings and developing new products and services, including machine learning or Artificial Intelligence ("AI") technologies.  </p>

<p><strong>Operational Purposes</strong>: We use personal information for operational purposes, and the operational purposes of our service providers, business partners, affiliates, and subsidiaries.  For instance, LegalZoom may use the information to maintain our website and other infrastructure, training, quality assurance, for conducting surveys or sweepstakes, to promote our brand, and to use in connection with our relationships with service providers and business partners.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Reporting</strong>: We use personal information in connection with various types of financial reporting and other similar internal uses.  Examples of the types of financial reporting that LegalZoom may use personal information in connection with includes internal budgets and projections, compensation calculations, and public reporting.</p>

<h2><strong>How We Disclose Personal Information</strong></h2>

<p>In this section of the Privacy Policy, we explain to whom we disclose personal information and under what circumstances we may make a disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may share personal information with our service providers who assist us with running our business.  These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any purpose other than providing services to LegalZoom or to you.</p>

<p><strong>Businesses Providing Services</strong>: LegalZoom may disclose personal information with other businesses in order to provide you with products and services that you have purchased from LegalZoom.  Personal information disclosed to other businesses will be subject to those third parties’ privacy practices.  For instance, we may use <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy.html">FedEx</a>, the <a href="https://about.usps.com/who/legal/privacy-policy/full-privacy-policy.htm">United States Postal Service</a>, or other shipping providers to deliver physical products you have purchased.  Similarly, we may use <a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/en/privacy">WorldPay</a>, <a href="https://www.adyen.com/policies-and-disclaimer/privacy-policy">Adyen</a>, or <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe</a> for purposes of processing payments or providing identity verification services.  In doing so, these companies may collect and process personal information for their own uses, including improving its services and for fraud detection and prevention.</p>

<p><strong>Professionals (including attorneys and Tax Experts)</strong>: We may share personal information with attorneys and Tax Experts whose services can be accessed through products such as our legal plans and attorney-assisted products. </p>

<p><strong>Business Partners</strong>: LegalZoom may share personal information with business partners.  When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy.  We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul><li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by LegalZoom on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of LegalZoom, you are directing LegalZoom to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
	<li>If you purchase a LegalZoom product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Parties Related to You</strong>:  We may provide information about you to someone you know or that you have connected with through our platform.  For instance, we may provide information connected to your LegalZoom account with your authorized contacts.  We may provide information about you to a customer requesting that you sign a document, such as whether you have completed the signature process.  </p>

<p><strong>Government Entities</strong>: LegalZoom may share information about customers with government entities to fulfill the products purchased by our customers.  Certain personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or a state government, or with a court.  For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name becomes public information when its articles of incorporation are filed.  A Secretary of State may publish this information to its website or provide this information to third parties.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office publishes the names and addresses of trademark registrants.  This Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions.</p>

<p><strong>Public Disclosures</strong>: LegalZoom may publicly disclose personal information in limited circumstances.</p>

<ul><li>We may share information publicly when it is necessary to fulfill a product that has been purchased by a customer.  For example, in some states, fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. </li>
	<li>We may display testimonials and reviews received through email surveys on our website or other marketing or that are posted to publicly available websites.</li>
	<li>When you post content in any forum or comment area on our website, these posts may be publicly available.  You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information in public areas of our website.</li>
	<li>When we collect publicly available information, we may share that information on our website. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Registered Agent Requests</strong>: If you designate a person or company other than LegalZoom to serve as the registered agent for your business entity, LegalZoom may provide your name and contact information to that party, if the designee requests.</p>

<p><strong>Required by Law</strong>: LegalZoom may disclose personal information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal processes.  We may also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legitimate request from a government entity.</p>

<p><strong>Parties Related to LegalZoom</strong>: LegalZoom may disclose personal information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with LegalZoom.  If LegalZoom is merged, acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or transfer consumer data in connection with the associated transactions.</p>

<h2><strong>How Long We Retain Your Personal Information</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>LegalZoom’s Security and Identity Verification Practices</strong></h2>

<p>LegalZoom is committed to protecting the personal information that we collect and ensuring our products and services are provided in a secure manner.  We have implemented security measures designed to protect the personal information that we maintain.  This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to secure the information we collect.  We use industry-standard SSL/TLS to transmit payment card information.  We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

<p>Regardless of the measures and efforts that LegalZoom takes to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute protection and security of your personal information.  For instance, when we transmit documents to you via mail delivery services or electronically, there remains the possibility that this information may be misdirected, misdelivered, or intercepted. </p>

<p>We encourage you to take precautions in protecting the information that you share with LegalZoom.  For example, we encourage you to set strong passwords on your account and avoid sharing your password with anyone.  Where available, we encourage, and may at times require, you to utilize multi-factor authentication to further ensure access to your account is restricted.</p>

<p>If you believe that you have discovered a security vulnerability in our website or services, you may let us know at <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/security">https://www.legalzoom.com/security</a>.   If you believe that someone has accessed your personal information or that your personal information has been misused, please let us know immediately by submitting your concerns through our online <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/57defedd-c3a5-4812-bbea-5a4efe817eda/14b2ce69-8d25-4dfe-a9d7-8f223bf268bf.html?_ga=2.239656768.271368780.1667589176-345465873.1616471245">Privacy Form</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Information for U.S. Residents of States with Comprehensive Privacy Laws.</strong></h2>

<p>If you are a U.S. resident of a state with a comprehensive privacy law, this section provides information regarding your rights, and LegalZoom’s responsibilities, regarding your personal information. </p>

<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>

<p>Certain states have privacy laws that provide consumers with rights regarding their personal information, such as the right to request:</p>

<ul><li>Specific information about what information LegalZoom has collected about you,</li>
	<li>A copy of your personal information,</li>
	<li>Corrections to inaccuracies in the personal information LegalZoom maintains about you, and</li>
	<li>The deletion of your personal information.</li>
</ul><p>These rights are not absolute, and in some circumstances, LegalZoom may decline to satisfy your request.  For example, if we are unable to verify your identity or if your request impacts other people’s privacy rights, we may deny your request to exercise these rights.  We may also deny your request when LegalZoom has the legal right to do so, such as when we have an ongoing business relationship with you, an ongoing need to use the information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or we are legally required to retain your personal information.  If LegalZoom denies your request to exercise your privacy rights, we will tell you why we are denying the request and provide you with information about how to appeal this decision.</p>

<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide a different quality of services unless those differences are related to your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>How to Submit a Request for Access, Correction, or Deletion of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If you would like to submit a request about your personal information, we encourage you to do so by completing the form located <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/57defedd-c3a5-4812-bbea-5a4efe817eda/14b2ce69-8d25-4dfe-a9d7-8f223bf268bf.html?_ga=2.239656768.271368780.1667589176-345465873.1616471245">here</a>.  You can also submit a request by emailing <a href="mailto:privacyrequests@legalzoom.com">privacyrequests@legalzoom.com</a> or by calling our toll-free number at (800) 773-0888.</p>

<p>After you submit the request, you will be asked to verify your email address and may also be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity.  LegalZoom will attempt to verify your identity by asking for information that correlates with the information that we have previously collected about you.  If this is not possible, LegalZoom may request you submit additional information for verification, such as proof of residency or redacted government-issued identification.</p>

<p>You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.  To designate an authorized agent, you must provide LegalZoom with written permission for the agent to make the request on your behalf or provide us with an executed power of attorney.  You will also be required to submit both your and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification.</p>

<p><strong>How to Appeal a Denial of a Request for Access, Correction, or Deletion of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If LegalZoom denies your request about your personal information, you may submit an appeal of the decision by completing the form located <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/57defedd-c3a5-4812-bbea-5a4efe817eda/14b2ce69-8d25-4dfe-a9d7-8f223bf268bf.html?_ga=2.154166392.1145445676.1671130746-2029511918.1669824512">here</a>.  You can also submit a request by emailing <a href="mailto:privacyrequests@legalzoom.com">privacyrequests@legalzoom.com</a>.  After you submit the request, you will be asked to verify your email address.</p>

<p>Once an appeal is submitted and your email is verified, the request and LegalZoom’s response will be reviewed.  In connection with this review, LegalZoom may request that you submit additional information regarding your request.  We will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 60 days.</p>

<p><strong>Selling, Sharing, and Use of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising</strong></p>

<p>LegalZoom does not "sell" this information for money.  However, we engage in routine online activities with third parties in ways that could be considered a "sale" or "sharing" as defined under applicable law.  If you would like to opt-out of the use of your personal information for these purposes, you can submit this request through the link at the bottom of our homepage called “Your privacy choices.”</p>

<h2><strong>Information for EU and UK Customers and Visitors.</strong></h2>
