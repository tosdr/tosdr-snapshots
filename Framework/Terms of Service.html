<h2>Assignment of contract</h2>

<p>Framework reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions will apply accordingly.</p>

<p>Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions in any way, without prior written permission of Framework.</p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>All communications relating to the use of this Website must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.</p>

<h2>Severability</h2>

<p>Should any provision of these Terms and Conditions be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>Should any provision of these Terms and Conditions be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.</p>

<p>In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>

<p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>

<h2>Governing law</h2>

<p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by Dutch law.</p>

<h1>Article 16. Dispute resolution</h1>

<h2>Amicable dispute resolution</h2>

<p>Users may bring any disputes to Framework who will try to resolve such dispute promptly and amicably.</p>

<p>While Users' right to take legal action shall always remain unaffected, in the event of any controversy regarding the use of this Website or the Service, Users are kindly asked to contact Framework at the contact details provided in this document.</p>

<p>The User may submit the complaint including a brief description and if applicable, the details of the related order, purchase, or account, to Framework’s email address specified in this document.</p>

<p>Framework will process the complaint without undue delay and within 21 days of receiving it.</p>

<h2>Online dispute resolution for consumers and customers</h2>

<p>As a result, any European consumer/customer or consumer/customer based in Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein can use such a platform for resolving disputes stemming from contracts which have been entered into online. The platform is available at the following link.</p>
