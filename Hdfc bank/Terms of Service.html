                    <p>As part of various ongoing tax and regulatory developments around the globe (e.g. FATCA), financial institutions such as HDFC Bank are being cast with additional investor and counterparty account related due diligence requirements.? Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is an U.S. tax initiative that requires all financial institutions to report information to the relevant tax authorities about US accounts or accounts of certain entities in which U.S. persons hold a substantial ownership interest. Similar initiatives are taking place at the behest of many other countries.<br />
<br />
HDFC Bank is taking appropriate measures in order to become FATCA compliant, with effect from 1 July, 2014 subject to local regulations. It would also have to comply with other similar laws, going forward. Towards compliance with FATCA and similar laws, we would be required to seek additional personal, tax and beneficial owner information and certain certifications and documentation from our investors and counterparties. Such information may be sought either at the time of account opening or any time subsequently. <br />
<br />
The onus to provide accurate, adequate and timely inputs in this regard would be that of the accountholder or counterparty. In this regard, any change in the status or information or certification previously provided should also be intimated to HDFC Bank within 30 days. In the appropriate cases and also especially in case of any omission, delay or failure in providing such information, we would/ may be constrained to report relevant information pertaining to the account to domestic or foreign tax authorities. <br />
<br />
For the purposes of such regulations, we may also be required to provide information to any institutions such as withholding agents for the purpose of ensuring appropriate withholding from the account or any proceeds in relation thereto. As may be required by domestic or overseas regulators/ tax authorities, we may also be constrained to withhold and pay out any sums from your account or close or suspend your account(s).<br />
<br />
We will be unable to provide advice you about any tax status or FATCA classification relevant to your account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you record your correct tax status/ FATCA classification. You may seek advice from your tax advisor in this regard. <br />
<br />
Please note that you may receive more than one request for information if you have multiple relationships with different members of the HDFC Group. Therefore, it is important that you respond to our request, even if you believe you have already supplied any previously requested information.</p>

                    <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%" class=" cke_show_border"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><ul><li>The Public Provident Fund scheme is a statutory scheme of the Central Government framed under the provisions of the Public Provident Act,1968. The approved branches of HDFC Bank Limited have been designated as accounts offices under the scheme. A year for the purpose of this scheme means the financial year ending 31st March. You can subscribe any amount in multiples of Rs 5/- between Rs 500/- and Rs 1,50,000/- in a year to your public provident fund account. It is not necessary that you should subscribe every month of the year. You can vary the amount of subscription to suit your convenience. Maximum of 12 subscriptions are allowed in a year.</li><li>The account entitles you to obtain a loan. If you require it you can apply for your first loan in the third year from the year of opening your account i.e. if you have opened your account in 2016-17, you can apply for your first loan in 2018-19. You are entitled to receive 25 % of the balance to your credit on 31-03-2017 by way of loan, repayable in 36 months in convenient monthly installments. You can get further loans upto the end of the fifth year following the expiry of the year in which the initial subscription was made. But no second loan can be taken so long as the first loan has not been fully repaid and the amount of any fresh loan will be restricted to 25 % of the balance at credit at the end of the second year immediately preceding the year in which the loan is applied for. No loan can be taken after the end of the fifth year as indicated above.</li><li>Some limited facilities for final withdrawals without closing the account have also been provided. The withdrawal will be restricted to 50 per cent of the amount at credit at the end of the sixth year immediately preceding the year in which the amount is withdrawn. For example, this partial withdrawal can be made for the first time on 01-04-2022 so as to get 50 % cent of the balance to your credit on 31-03-2017. Similar withdrawals can also be made subsequently at three year intervals but the amount which can be withdrawn will be restricted to 50 % of the amount standing to your credit at the end of the sixth year, immediately preceding the year in which the withdrawal is made.</li><li>The Public Provident Fund Scheme allows you to withdraw the entire amounts to your credit after adjustment of the dues if any to Government on completion of 15 years after the end of the year in which you opened your account. That is to say if you opened your account in 2016-17, you can withdraw the entire balances to your credit any time after 01-04-2032. This is, of course optional. You can continue your account without any loss of benefits.</li><li>As per existing provisions subscription to the Public Provident Fund qualify for deduction from taxable income together with savings in other approved form namely, recognized Provident Funds, Life Insurance, etc. The interest credited to the fund and the amount standing to the credit of the subscribers are exempt from Income Tax and Wealth Tax respectively.</li><li>You are entitled to nominate one or more person to receive any final payment, which is due to you, in the event of your death. The facility of nomination is one that should be availed of by you, as your heirs may otherwise be put to the avoidable inconvenience of producing succession certificates to establish their claims to the amount due to them. A subscriber to the fund cannot nominate a trust as his nominee.</li><li>Revival of discontinued account - Depositors seeking condonation of the default in making minimum subscription of Rs 500/- per annum can revive their PPF account by payment of a fee of Rs 50/- for each year of default along-with arrears of subscription of Rs 500/- for each default / financial year.</li><li>Request for Premature closure of accounts. The Branches will not entertain any request for premature closure of PPF account under the noted grounds:<br /><br />(a)Migration abroad (b) marriage (c) purchase of house / vehicle (d) ceremonial occasions (e) repayment of loan (f) education (g) retiring, suspension from job, etc. <br /><br />Only those cases falling under extreme compassionate ground such as medial support in life threatening diseases cases, death cases, etc. deserve consideration for granting closure and will be entertained.</li><li>Operation by a Power of Attorney Holder - In the absence of a specific provision in the Public Provident Fund Scheme 1968, a power of Attorney Holder can neither open a PPF account nor operate any PPF account on behalf of a subscriber.</li><li>Non Resident Indians - NRIs are not eligible to open an account under the PPF Scheme. Provided that if a resident who subsequently becomes NRI during the currency of maturity period prescribed under PPF Scheme, may continue to subscribe to the Fund till its maturity on a non-repatriation basis.</li><li>It is important and will be desirable in your own interest to ensure that changes in your address are communicated promptly to the accounts office.</li><li>For PPF account opened online, the default branch is maintained as Anna Nagar. However, the account can be operated from any branch.</li><li>Please note, if any deposit in PPF account is done post 11:00 PM, then value date of next day will reflect in the system.<br /></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

WHEREAS the Borrower has requested the Bank online, to sanction an overdraft facility against the security of any shares, or other securities satisfactory to the Bank which may be pledged by the Borrower from time to time, hereinafter referred to as the Security/Securities.<br /><br />AND WHEREAS the grant of the said overdraft facility, if any by Bank, shall depend upon the terms and conditions contained herein:<br /><br />The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to abide by the following terms and conditions:</p><p><br /></p><ol><li>The grant by the Bank to the Borrower of an overdraft facility (“Overdraft Facility”) shall be upon the terms and conditions contained herein. The Borrower understands and acknowledges that the actual amount of the overdraft facility that may be sanctioned from time to time would depend on the discretion of the Bank, the value of the Securities to be pledged/ charged in favour of the Bank and the Bank&#39;s policies from time to time and the maximum aggregate amount of such facility shall at no time exceed regulatory limits as may be prescribed from time to time, if any. The grant of the overdraft facility in favour of the Borrower is conditional upon (i) the Borrower pledging/ charging the Securities in favour of the Bank in a manner which is satisfactory to the Bank. The pledge of the Securities shall be created by the Borrower in the manner specified by the Bank prior to the disbursement of any advances by the Bank to the Borrower as an exclusive charge to the Bank towards repayment of all amounts due pursuant hereto, including the principal amount sanctioned to the Borrower together with the interest accrued, compound interest, default interest, all other monies, fees, costs, expenses, charges, etc., (Outstanding Balance)under these terms (ii) the Borrower complying with such other conditions as may be required by the Bank from time to time. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that in the event they do not comply with the conditions specified in (i) and (ii) above (viz. they do not pledge/ charge the Securities in favour of the Bank) within a period of 30 (Thirty) days of the execution hereof, the Bank may, at its sole discretion, cancel the overdraft facility without any reimbursement of the processing fee and/or any other charges already paid by the Borrower in connection thereof. For clarity, even if the combination of holders in the demat account from which the Securities shall be pledged in favour of the Bank, is different from the combination of holders in the overdraft account/current account, the Borrowers shall have no objection to the same.<br /><br /><br /></li><li>The sanctioned amount of the overdraft facility (“Sanctioned Credit Limit”) that the Borrower shall draw the amounts from the overdraft facility from time to time, as per the conditions hereof, would depend upon the discretion of the Bank and the value of the Securities to be pledged with the Bank from time to time prior to the disbursal/ drawal of any amounts under the overdraft facility. The decisions in respect of the valuation of the Securities, margin money and the actual disbursal under the overdraft facility would be exclusively taken by the Bank and will be binding on the Borrower. As on the date of acceptance of the terms and conditions mentioned herein, the Sanctioned Credit Limit is as mentioned in the Schedule. In terms of the Bank&#39;s policies and based on the value of the Securities, the Sanctioned Credit Limit could stand enhanced or reduced accordingly, but in any event will not exceed the amount of the overdraft facility. It is clarified, however, that the mere provision of Securities by the Borrower and/or compliance by the Borrower of the other conditions that may be stipulated by the Bank would not automatically entitle the Borrower to an increase in the amount sanctioned by the Bank under the overdraft facility and any such increase would be at the sole discretion of the Bank whose decision in this regard shall be final and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower understands and acknowledges that the Borrower is not entitled to draw cheques on and/or issue payment instructions with respect to the overdraft account in an amount which is greater than the un-drawn Sanctioned Credit Limit and that any cheque presented for an amount greater than the un-drawn Sanctioned Credit Limit (as prevalent on the date of such presentment) shall be dishonoured by the Bank and the Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any losses or damages which the Borrower may suffer as a result of such cheque(s) being dishonoured. It is clarified that this will be the case even when the amount of the cheque was equal to or lower than the un-drawn Sanctioned Credit Limit at the time of its issue but in excess of the un-drawn Sanctioned Credit Limit at the time of its presentment.<br /><br /><br /></li><li>Notwithstanding anything mentioned in the facility documents, the Borrower acknowledges that the Bank reserves an unconditional right to cancel/terminate Borrower&#39;s right to avail of or make drawals from the unavailed portion of the Overdraft Facility sanctioned at any time during the currency of the Overdraft Facility, without any prior notice to the Borrower.<br /><br /></li><li> Further changes in Sanctioned Credit Limit will be communicated from time to time by various means and methods and this would be the Borrower&#39;s Sanctioned Credit Limit and will be reflected in the Bank&#39;s system as the Sanctioned Credit Limit. Such communication may be by way of email, SMS or monthly bank statements, telegram or any other mode as mutually agreed between the Bank and the Borrower.<br /><br /><br /></li><li>Notwithstanding anything stated elsewhere in these terms and conditions, the continuation of the Overdraft Facility shall be at sole and absolute discretion of the Bank and the Borrower&#39;s outstanding shall be payable to the Bank on demand.

Such revised rate may be subsequently intimated to the Borrower. The Borrower acknowledges that the Borrower is aware of the interest rate and of the fact that the same will fluctuate throughout the tenure of the overdraft facility. The Borrower agrees and accepts that the rate of interest declared by the Bank from time to time shall be binding on the Borrower.

The new fixed rate applicable upon renewal for the next 1 (one) year and every successive renewal period of 1 (one) year shall be communicated by the Bank to the Borrower at/ around the time each renewal and each such new fixed rate shall be applicable from the corresponding date of renewal. The Borrower’s continued use of the facility and/or overdraft limit and/or non-closure of the current account shall amount to the Borrower’s acceptance of the new fixed rate applicable upon such renewal without any further act, deed or writing. Each fixed rate as communicated by the Bank and as applicable for each renewal period shall be deemed to have been incorporated in the Schedule hereto and deemed to be part and parcel of these terms and conditions without any further act deed or writing.
