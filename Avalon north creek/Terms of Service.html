<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;</span></li>

    <li><span style="color: #595959;">A statement that the reporting person has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #595959;"></span>A statement that the information in the notice is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that the reporting person is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send all DMCA notices to AvalonBay&rsquo;s copyright contact to receive notifications of claimed infringement (the &ldquo;DMCA Contact&rdquo;) at:</p>
<p>AvalonBay Communities, Inc <br />
Attn: Digital Marketing <br />
4040 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1000 <br />
Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p style="background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Please be advised that DMCA notices should go to the DMCA contact at the above address. The complaining person acknowledges that in the event he/she fails to comply with all the requirements of this Section, such person&rsquo;s DMCA notice may not be valid. We recommend that you speak to a legal advisor before filing a DMCA notice with our designated agent to assess your rights.</span></p>
<p> <span style="color: #595959;">If the person who is allegedly infringing a copyright (as reported by the complaining person above) believes that content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that such person has access from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&rsquo;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content, the person responding to the complaint may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the DMCA Contact</span>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">The responding person&rsquo;s physical or electronic signature;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #595959;">A statement that the responding person has a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</span></li>
    <li>Such responding person&rsquo;s name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that such responding person consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district where the responding person&rsquo;s address is located, and that the responding person will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">If a counter-notice is received by the DMCA Contact, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing such party that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, in our sole discretion.</span></p>
<p><strong>Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p style="background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">These terms shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the United States of America and international copyright laws. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Commonwealth of Virginia for any and all disputes, claims and actions arising out of or in connection with the information provided to you herein.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Certain portions of his Section are deemed to be a &ldquo;written agreement to arbitrate&rdquo; pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and we agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the &ldquo;writing&rdquo; requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.</span></p>
<p> <span style="color: #595959;">If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the content on the Service, our Service activities and submissions, and/or the Terms of Use, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;), you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to the most recent contact information that you provide to us. If no such contact information exists or if contact information is not current, then we have no obligation to contact you to try to resolve the Dispute. Your notice to us must be sent to us at the following address</span>:</p>
<p>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. <br />
Attn: Legal <br />
4040 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1000 <br />
Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, although nothing will require either party to agree to any resolution</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong></p>
<p style="background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth above within sixty (60) days of receipt of the required notice, and unless you provide us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: DMCA-Contact@avalonbay.com, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT &ndash; INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT, OR NEGLIGENCE &ndash; COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE USE OR PROVISION OF THIS SERVICE. The Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), and not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between us and you regarding these Terms and the Service. You and we agree, however, that Virginia law shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies and damages arising between you and us regarding a Dispute, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to Virginia&rsquo;s choice of law principles that might apply other states&rsquo; laws.</span></p>
<p> <span style="color: #595959;">Disputes will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). If a party properly submits a Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to hold a hearing, then either party may elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) using JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in accordance with Virginia&rsquo;s civil rules governing discovery. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by AAA or JAMS (depending on the arbitral forum). The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates&rsquo; lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of the Terms of Use, will be bound by these Terms of Use, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service. Prior to appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, either party may, at any time, seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, if sought by AvalonBay, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section. The losing party to the arbitration shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Injunctive Relief</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">The foregoing provisions of this Section will not apply to any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost or damage (or any potential loss, cost or damage) relating to any Dispute and/or our rights, our operations, and/or our products or services. Further, as permitted by applicable law, alleged loses, damages, or injuries claimed in connection with your use of the Service will not be deemed irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction or other equitable relief. Thus, without limitation, you agree that you will not seek (and you will not be permitted to obtain) any relief in any court or other legal proceeding that may interfere with or prevent the development or exploitation of any website, application, content, UGC, product, service, or intellectual property owned, licensed, used, or controlled by AvalonBay or by a licensor of AvalonBay</span>. </p>
<p><strong>No Class Action Matters</strong></p>
<p style="background: white; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #595959;">Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Notwithstanding any provision in the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules or JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, there shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class basis or any other basis involving Disputes brought to a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other person or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court in Alexandria, Virginia (to which jurisdiction and venue you irrevocably consent). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of these class action waiver provisions are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitrator.</span></p>
<p> <span style="color: #595959;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim in small claims court</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">As permitted by applicable law, AvalonBay reserves the right, without limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, (iii) use any information obtained by AvalonBay in accordance with its <a href="https://www.avaloncommunities.com/us-state-privacy-notice/" title="US State Privacy Notice">U.S. State Privacy Notice</a>&nbsp;in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with applicable laws and use and/or disclose any information obtained by AvalonBay to comply with law enforcement requests or legal requirements in accordance our <a href="https://www.avaloncommunities.com/us-state-privacy-notice/" title="US State Privacy Notice">U.S. State Privacy Notice</a>, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, or, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third-party. Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to us under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from us, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Service. The provisions of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to AvalonBay in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed from these Terms, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining Terms</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Terms</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #595959;">Please note that these Terms, along with any other documents incorporated by reference, make up the entire agreement between you and AvalonBay. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you. You may not transfer any rights given or obligations borne to you under these Terms without our express consent. We do not waive any provision under these Terms even if it is not enforced</span>.</p>

THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE USE OR PROVISION OF THIS SERVICE. The Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), and not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between us and you regarding these Terms and the Service. You and we agree, however, that Virginia law shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies and damages arising between you and us regarding a Dispute, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to Virginia&rsquo;s choice of law principles that might apply other states&rsquo; laws.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"color: #595959;\">Disputes will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). If a party properly submits a Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to hold a hearing, then either party may elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) using JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in accordance with Virginia&rsquo;s civil rules governing discovery. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by AAA or JAMS (depending on the arbitral forum). The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates&rsquo; lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of the Terms of Use, will be bound by these Terms of Use, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service. Prior to appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, either party may, at any time, seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, if sought by AvalonBay, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section. The losing party to the arbitration shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to a court of competent jurisdiction in Arlington County, Virginia or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Injunctive Relief</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #595959;\">The foregoing provisions of this Section will not apply to any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost or damage (or any potential loss, cost or damage) relating to any Dispute and/or our rights, our operations, and/or our products or services. Further, as permitted by applicable law, alleged loses, damages, or injuries claimed in connection with your use of the Service will not be deemed irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction or other equitable relief. Thus, without limitation, you agree that you will not seek (and you will not be permitted to obtain) any relief in any court or other legal proceeding that may interfere with or prevent the development or exploitation of any website, application, content, UGC, product, service, or intellectual property owned, licensed, used, or controlled by AvalonBay or by a licensor of AvalonBay</span>. </p>\n<p><strong>No Class Action Matters</strong></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #595959;\">Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Notwithstanding any provision in the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules or JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, there shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class basis or any other basis involving Disputes brought to a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other person or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court in Alexandria, Virginia (to which jurisdiction and venue you irrevocably consent). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of these class action waiver provisions are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitrator.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"color: #595959;\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim in small claims court</span>.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #595959;\">As permitted by applicable law, AvalonBay reserves the right, without limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, (iii) use any information obtained by AvalonBay in accordance with its <a href=\"https://www.avaloncommunities.com/us-state-privacy-notice/\" title=\"US State Privacy Notice\">U.S. State Privacy Notice</a>&nbsp;in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with applicable laws and use and/or disclose any information obtained by AvalonBay to comply with law enforcement requests or legal requirements in accordance our <a href=\"https://www.avaloncommunities.com/us-state-privacy-notice/\" title=\"US State Privacy Notice\">U.S. State Privacy Notice</a>, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, or, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third-party.
