<h2><b>Your Service Provider</b></h2>
<p>The entity providing the Service in the United Kingdom is Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).  References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group.</p>
<h2><b>Applicable Terms</b></h2>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">YouTube Community Guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/policies">Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies</a> (together, the "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084">Advertising on YouTube Policies</a> if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your Content.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>
<h1 id="eb887a967c"><b>Who may use the Service?</b></h1>
<h2><b>Age Requirements</b></h2>
<p>You may use the Service if you are at least 13 years old; however, children of all ages may use the Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.</p>
<h2><b>Permission by Parent or Guardian</b></h2>
<p>If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you.</p>

<p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software, metrics, and other materials (collectively, "Content”). Content may be provided to the Service and distributed by our users and YouTube is a provider of hosting services for such Content. Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with these terms, such as by violating the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> or the law, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027">report it to us</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</b></h2>
<p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/69961">Google account</a>. However, you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount">create a Google account</a>.</p>
<p>Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading videos, making comments or creating playlists. Here are some details about how to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861">create your own YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/46526">keeping your Google account secure</a>, including what to do if you learn of any unauthorised use of your password or Google account.</p>
<h2><b>Your Information</b></h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service.

<h2><b>Permissions and Restrictions</b></h2>
<p>You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and the law. You may view or listen to Content for your personal, non-commercial use. You may also show YouTube videos through the embeddable YouTube player.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:</p>
<ol class="decimal" start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as specifically permitted by the Service;  (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders; or (c) as permitted by applicable law;</li>
<li>circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage, or otherwise interfere with the Service (or attempt to do any of these things), including security-related features or features that: (a) prevent or restrict the copying or other use of Content; or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content;</li>
<li>access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except: (a) in the case of public search engines, in accordance with YouTube’s robots.txt file; (b) with YouTube’s prior written permission; or (c) as permitted by applicable law;</li>

<li>use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations (spam);</li>

<li>misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or frivolous submissions;</li>

<li>use the Service to view or listen to Content other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, you may not publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or</li>
<li>use the Service to: (a) sell any advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on, around, or within the Service or Content, other than those allowed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/ads_policies">Advertising on YouTube</a> policies (such as compliant product placements); or (b) sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage where YouTube videos are the only content of value).</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Reservation</b></h2>
<p>Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective rights holders. This means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).</p>
<h2><b>Develop, Improve and Update the Service</b></h2>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of theService or if we stop offering any part of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1">Google Takeout,</a> subject to applicable law and policies. </p>
<h1 id="27dc3bf5d9"><b>Your Content and Conduct</b></h1>
<h2><b>Uploading Content</b></h2>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<h2><b>Rights you Grant</b></h2>
<p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<h2><b>Licence to YouTube</b></h2>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</p>
<h2><b>Licence to Other Users</b></h2>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a feature of the Service.</p>
<h2><b>Duration of Licence</b></h2>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires otherwise.  For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for legal purposes.</p>
<p><b>Right to Monetize</b></p>
<p>You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.</p>
<h2><b>Removing Your Content</b></h2>
<p>You may <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770">remove your Content</a> from the Service at any time. You also have the option to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100">make a copy of your Content</a> before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<h2><b>Removal of Content By YouTube</b></h2>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024">Troubleshooting</a> page of our Help Center.</p>
<h1><b>Community Guidelines Strikes</b></h1>
<p>YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">YouTube Community Guidelines</a>. Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032">Community Guidelines Strikes Basics</a> page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/">appeal here</a>.</p>
<p>If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.</p>
<h2><b>Copyright Protection</b></h2>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center">YouTube Copyright Center</a>. If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622">send us a notice</a>.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center">YouTube Copyright Center</a>, where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<h1 id="8d13a409a3"><b>Account Suspension and Termination</b></h1>
<h2><b>Terminations by You</b></h2>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/youtubeoptions">delete the Service</a> from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy of your data first. </p>
<h2><b>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube</b></h2>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe that there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.<br></p>
<h2><b>Notice for Termination or Suspension</b></h2>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<h2><b>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</b></h2>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your that the termination or suspensionhas been made in error, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube">appeal using this form</a>.</p>
<h1 id="8c38269fae"><b>About Software in our Service</b></h1>
<h2><b>Downloadable Software</b></h2>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<h2><b>Open Source</b></h2>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence. There may be provisions in an open source licence that expressly override some of these terms.  If so, we will make that open source licence available to you.</p>
