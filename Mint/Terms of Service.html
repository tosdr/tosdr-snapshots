We provide a platform (the “Platform”) that encompasses (1) a variety of services, including TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Mint (each, a “Service”); and (2) installable software (including our desktop and mobile applications), any accompanying documentation, and any updates to such software or documentation (collectively, “Software”). Intuit Inc., along with any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or related companies (including those listed here and at <a href="https://www.intuit.com/legal/intuit-group-companies/" target="_blank">https://www.intuit.com/legal/intuit-group-companies/</a>) are referred to in these provisions as “Intuit Group Companies” or simply “Intuit” or “us.”</p><p>    When you use the Platform, you enter into a binding contract with us. Each section of the agreement begins with an italicized annotation that is intended to help you navigate the agreement.  The annotations do not completely summarize the agreement, though, and you should read each section carefully and in full.  We’ve also bolded a few areas that talk about important legal rights, and you should be sure to read those sections carefully.  These provisions in Section A apply to the Platform generally and are separate from the provisions in Section B which include additional provisions for your use of specific Intuit Software or Services.</p><p>    If you are an individual acting on your company’s or client’s behalf, you accept these provisions on their behalf and the term “you” will refer to you, your company, or your client.</p> <p>    <span class="headline-04">        <strong>            Agreement to These Terms        </strong>    </span></p><p>    You need to agree to these terms to use our Platform. By using the Platform, you are instructing us to share your data across our Platform for marketing, eligibility, and other purposes described in our <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement</a>, consistent with applicable law.  This data may include credit information and other information we obtain from third parties.</p><p>    To access and/or use the Platform, you acknowledge and agree:</p><ul>    <li>        <p>            To the terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement”), which includes:        </p>    </li>    <ul>        <li>            <p>                Intuit’s <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement</a>;            </p>        </li>        <li>            <p>                The current version of the terms set out in Section A and Section B; and            </p>        </li>        <li>            <p>                Any additional provisions and conditions provided separately to you for your use of the Platform, which may include terms and conditions from third parties (which we refer to as “Additional Terms”)            </p>        </li>    </ul>    <li>        <p>            You are at least 18 years of age;        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            You are capable of forming a binding contract with Intuit; and        </p>    </li>    <li>        <p>            You are not a person who is prohibited from using the Platform under the laws of the United States, or any other applicable jurisdiction.        </p>    </li></ul><p>    You understand that by using certain Services, you are providing written instructions in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable law to permit Intuit Inc. and its affiliated companies to obtain and periodically refresh your credit information and other information about you from third parties for marketing, eligibility, and other purposes described in Intuit's <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement</a>.

You further agree that, other than with respect to information furnished to TurboTax in connection with the preparation of an individual tax return, any sharing of personal information among Intuit Group Companies is contemplated as part of the Platform.

We may notify you of such modifications by posting through the Platform or on our website or by other means.

For annual subscriptions, we will send you a reminder with the then-current subscription fee no less than thirty (30) days and no more than sixty (60) days before your subscription term ends, or otherwise as required by applicable law. Intuit may change the price for recurring subscription fees from time to time with notice to you. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.

Either you or Intuit may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in your county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your residence, and you may also bring a claim in small claims court in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.</p><p>    Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Intuit are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of your account.</p><p>    If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Intuit a written notice of your Claim ("Notice of Claim"). The Notice of Claim to Intuit should be sent in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like Intuit to use to contact you. If Intuit elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Intuit, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought.</p><p>    You and Intuit agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Intuit therefore agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but before either you or Intuit commence arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court against the other, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Claim covered by this Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. Likewise, if Intuit is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the conference as well, but Intuit agrees to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</p><p>    If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Intuit may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or, alternatively, by filing a Claim in small claims court. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court unless you and Intuit are unable to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after we receive your completed Notice of Claim and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with Intuit during that time. If a Claim qualifies for small claims court, but a party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and Intuit agree that either party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of a party’s election, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administratively close the arbitration proceeding. Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such dispute, the arbitration proceeding shall remain closed unless and until a decision by the small claims court that the Claim should proceed in arbitration. You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879, except as modified by this Agreement. Unless Intuit and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.</p><p>    The arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California or the state of your residence and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s National Roster of Arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; (c) the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided below, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</p><p>    The parties agree that an administrative conference with the AAA shall be conducted in each arbitration proceeding, and you and an Intuit company representative shall appear at the administrative conference via telephone. If you fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether your counsel attends, the AAA will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as to why you were not able to attend the conference.</p><p>    The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. Intuit will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration from you unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude any party to the arbitration from at any time seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction including whether a Demand for Arbitration is filed in violation of this Agreement.</p><p>    Unless you or Intuit seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or Intuit and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or Intuit prevail on a Claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration. Before a court of competent jurisdiction issues any public injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of the arbitration award on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the arbitrator.</p><p>    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. You are required to pay AAA’s initial filing fee, but Intuit will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the arbitration to the extent it exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and Intuit will not reimburse your initial filing fee. The parties agree that the AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under the AAA Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the AAA fees to you or Intuit, and you and Intuit waive any objection to such fee modification.</p><p>    <strong>You and Intuit agree that each may bring Claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and Intuit agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate any other person's Claims with your Claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If Intuit believes that any Claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with the limitations in this paragraph, then you agree that Intuit may seek an order from a court determining whether your Claim is within the scope of the Class Action Waiver. If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes Section shall be null and void.</p><p>    <span class="headline-04">         <strong>            General Terms (Miscellaneous)        </strong>    </span></p><p>    <span class="headline-04">        <strong>            Governing Law        </strong>    </span></p><p>    <i>        The laws of California govern this Agreement and any disputes that may arise.    </i></p><p>    California law and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to the Platform, this Agreement and any Additional Terms, regardless of conflict of laws rules.</p><p>    <span class="headline-04">        <strong>            Global Trade and Export Restrictions        </strong>    </span></p><p>    You are allowed to use the Platform under the laws of the U.S. and other applicable territories.
