Goodwill provides Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by Goodwill of the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk and by accessing them, you leave this Website. Linked Sites are not under the control of Goodwill and Goodwill is not responsible for any content of any Linked Sites.</p><p><strong>Modifications to our Website or Services</strong></p><p>Goodwill reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, our Website and/or Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice in our sole discretion. You agree that Goodwill shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of our Website and/or Services.</p><p><strong>Your Account Information, Password and Security</strong></p><p>In the course of your use of our Website or Services, we may ask you for certain information, including your name, email address, mailing address and credit card information (collectively, “Account Information). If you open an account or commence any transaction of business at or on this Website, you may be required to complete the registration process by providing certain additional information and registering a username and password. Your Account Information must be up-to-date and accurate at all times. Should your information change, you must update it in your user profile. Please see our FAQs for more information on how to update your information. You agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of your Account Information. You are further responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and also for all activities that take place under your account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each Website session. Consistent with and without limiting the scope of provisions limiting liability elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event will Goodwill be liable for any indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever resulting from the disclosure of your username and/or password or your failure to comply with this section. You may not use another persons account at any time, without the express permission of the account holder.</p><p><strong>Auction Bidding and Buying; Non-Paying Bidders</strong></p><p>New bidders (buyers with user accounts less than 30 days old) will be restricted to participating in no more than 15 active auctions at one time. As a bidder, if you have the highest bid at the end of the auction period, at or above the minimum bid price (or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the reserve price), and your bid is accepted by the seller, YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. Bids are not retractable except in exceptional circumstances (e.g., the seller materially changes the description of the item after your bid, clear typographical errors, or when the bidder cannot authenticate the identity of the seller). Bid manipulation is strictly prohibited. In other words, you may not bid in a way that pushes other bidders to their maximum bid, retract your original high bid, and re-bid at a small increment above the legitimate high bidder.</p><p>A Non-Paying Bidder is a person who wins the auction through the bidding process but does not follow through with the transaction and instead fails to fulfill his or her obligation to purchase the item(s) he or she won through the bidding process. The seller community of our Website is committed to notifying our staff regarding any Non-Paying Bidder. We take these situations very seriously and will record, monitor, suspend or ban any Non-Paying Bidder, or take other appropriate disciplinary, investigative or legal action, in our sole and absolute discretion.</p><p><strong>Product Availability and Pricing</strong></p><p>The inclusion of any products or Services on this Website at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or Services will be available at any time. Products may be out-of-stock, discontinued, or subject to other action by the seller. Prices are quoted in U.S. dollars, are effective for U.S. purchases only, and are subject to change at any time. Discounts are limited time offers and may not be combined with any other offers.

This Agreement, including the other policies referenced herein, shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding between Goodwill and you with respect to use of our Website and/or Services and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter addressed herein. This Agreement is binding on the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. If any provision in this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severed from the Agreement and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect as if no invalid or unenforceable provision had been part of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>Complaints or Concerns</strong></p><p>If you have any complaints or concerns regarding our Website or Services, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@shopgoodwill.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;">support@shopgoodwill.com</a>&nbsp;or 714-492-1150.
