Last update : 2003-06-18 11:08:27<br />
<br />
The site can not break out of the frames used when surfing with TradeVisits. This is very annoying for the users of the site. This will get your account deleted.<br><br>

<td align="center">Popup windows<br />
Last update : 2003-06-18 11:08:07<br />
<br />
Your site can have a maximum of one popup window because they are annoying for users of the service. Note sites also cannot generate additional popups once a popup is closed. Again a MAXIMUM ONE POPUP per site. Preferably don't have any popup windows on your site at all. That makes your visitors more happy. Note often people will leave a site just by seeing a popup window.<br><br>The one popup include any popups on the site, popups, popins and exit ads. And new window opened without the user clicking anything is a popup. Even if opened in the same browser window.<br><br>

We will only accept sites written in the english language. This is because many members have demanded it. And to have more people understand what it on the sites thay visit.<br><br>

<td align="center">Illegal contents<br />
Last update : 2001-05-06 00:00:00<br />
<br />
Your site can not have content that might be offensive for other people. This includes porn, warez, illegal copied software, etc. Common sense is to not have any illegal stuff on your site. The site must be PG13 allowed content, that means content that children can see.<br><br>
