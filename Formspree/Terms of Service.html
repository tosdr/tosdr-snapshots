<p>Please note that Section 11. Disputes with Formspree, contains an arbitration clause and class action

Formspree is not liable, and deny responsibility for, any damages, harm, or losses to you arising from or relating to hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Services, your Formspree Account, or Data, or your failure to use or implement anti-fraud measures, Security Controls, or any other data security measure.

<p>You agree to limit any additional liability not disclaimed or denied by Formspree under this Agreement to your direct and documented damages; and you further agree that under no circumstances will any such liability exceed in the aggregate the amount of Fees paid by you to Formspree during the three-month period immediately preceding the event that gave rise to your claim for damages.</p>
<p>These limitations on our liability to you will apply regardless of the legal theory on which your claim is based, including contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other theory or basis.</p>
<p>We provide the Services from facilities in the United States.
We do not claim, and we cannot guarantee that Services we provide from the United States are or will be appropriate or available for any other location or jurisdiction, comply with the Laws of any other location or jurisdiction, or comply with Laws governing export, import, or foreign use.</p>
<p><strong>13. Disputes with Formspree</strong></p>
<p>If you are upset with Formspree, please let us know and we hope to resolve your issue.
If we are unable to, these rules govern any legal dispute regarding our Services.</p>
<p>The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America.
These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p>
<p>You and Formspree agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a> or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879).
Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.
Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis&ndash;class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Formspree are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</p>
<p>Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in
accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000,
Formspree will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the
arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</p>
<p>If either you or Formspree intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration
must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the
arbitration. Notice to Formspree should be sent to Formspree at <a href="mailto:disputes@formspree.io">disputes@formspree.io</a>. Notice to
you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Formspree has in its records
at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being
sought. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file
a claim for arbitration.</p>
<p>Any legal action against Formspree related to our Services must be filed and take place in San
Antonio, TX. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be San Antonio. If for any reason a Dispute
proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out
of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Formspree, will be brought
exclusively in the courts located in the state court located in Bexar County, Texas or the United
States District Court for the Western District of Texas. In such cases, you and Formspree agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Antonio, Texas or
the Western District of Texas, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction
over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p>
<p>If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Services in your official
capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not
apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the
laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law
and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Texas.</p>
<p><strong>14. Chargeback/Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>Customer shall pay the fees applicable to the Paid Plan that Customer selected at the time of initial
sign-up. Customer may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other Paid Plan that Formspree is
currently offering at any time during Customer’s subscription term; provided that a downgrade will
be not be effective until the renewal of subscription term.</p>
<p>All fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, including in case of Customer’s termination of the
subscription term. Customer pays in advance total fees for the subscription term, and in advance at
renewal for any renewal term. No refunds will be provided for the unused portion of the
subscription term or renewal term in case of termination. Following any termination, however,
Customer will continue to have access to the Paid Plan Services through the end of Customer’s then-
current subscription term.</p>
<p>Formspree reserves the right to change the fees or to institute new charges or to otherwise change
the terms and conditions applicable to the Paid Plans; provided, however, that any such changes will
apply only (a) to new Services procured after the changes; and (b) to continuing Services for any
renewal term(s) starting after notice of such changes was provided or such earlier time as Customer
affirmatively accepts the modified terms.</p>
<p>Customer is responsible for all sales, use, value added and similar taxes of any nature associated
with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Formspree’s income.</p>
<p>If you have a question about charges made to your account, please contact us immediately. If the
charges were made in error, we will immediately credit your account or credit card account for the
appropriate amount.</p>
<p>Formspree has a zero tolerance policy for chargebacks. Any customer who disputes a credit card
payment that is found to be valid will be permanently blacklisted and barred from use of the Service.
Any past due fees and costs will be sent to collections. If our collection efforts fail, unpaid debts will
be reported to all available credit reporting agencies.</p>
<p>If an account is suspended for violation of Terms, Formspree is not obligated to provide a refund,
and will do so solely at its discretion.</p>
<p><strong>15. Publicity</strong></p>
<p>You agree that we may identify you as a customer in our promotional and marketing activities and
on our website.</p>
<p><strong>16. Termination/access restriction</strong></p>
<p>Formspree reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and the
related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. and you hereby consent to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Texas in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use
of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all
provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section. The Terms will remain in effect
even after your access to the Service is terminated, or your use of the Service ends.</p>
<p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you
and Formspree as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Formspree&rsquo;s performance of this
agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is
in derogation of Formspree&rsquo;s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement
requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by
Formspree with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or
unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and
liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
user and Formspree with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and
Formspree with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish
to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in English.</p>
<p><strong>17. Changes to Terms</strong></p>
<p>Formspree reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change the Terms under which Formspree is
offered. The most current version of the Terms will supersede all previous versions. Formspree
encourages you to periodically review the Terms to stay informed of our updates.</p>
