Any such waiver will be only to the specific provision and under the specific circumstances for which it was given, and will not apply with respect to any repeated or continued violation of the same provision or any other provision. Failure or delay by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.</p><p>10.5 <em>Relationship</em>.

For purposes hereof, “including” means “including without limitation”.</p><h4>11. Agreement to Arbitrate</h4><p>11.1 <em>First Try Customer Support</em>. If you have any issues with the Shogun Software or Shogun, you must try to resolve the issue first through Shogun customer support</p><p>11.2 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. If the parties are not able to the dispute through Shogun customer support, you and your affiliates on one hand, and Shogun and any of Shogun’s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms, or under Shogun’s Privacy Policy, or in relation to the Shogun Software by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, or in another location that both parties agree to. This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one the exceptions below. It also applies even after you have stopped using your Shogun account or have deleted it. If the parties have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to such dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that too.</p><p>11.3 <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and your affiliates on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that the parties will go to court to resolve disputes relating to your, your affiliate’s, Shogun’s or Shogun’s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents) or your violation of the AUP. Also, either party can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place both parties agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court. In addition, if either party brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or either party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Either party may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p><p>11.4 <em>Details of Arbitration Procedure</em>.</p><p>a. Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between the parties by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong><em>AAA</em></strong>“), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties. If mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website https://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<strong><em>Rules</em></strong>“) and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. To the extent any thing described in this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the Rules, the language of this agreement to arbitrate applies.</p><p>b. Each party will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions. All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. This agreement to arbitrate does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.</p><p>c. The arbitrator’s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award. The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.</p><p>d. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>11.5 <em>Class Action Waiver</em>. Both you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between the parties must be brought against each other on an individual basis only. That means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless both parties agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Shogun customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers. If a court decides that this class action waiver is not enforceable or valid, then the entire agreement to arbitrate will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer__section"><div class="footer__container"><div class="w-layout-grid footer__top-wrapper"><a
