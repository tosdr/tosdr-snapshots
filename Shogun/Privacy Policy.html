(“<strong>Shogun</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” and/or “<strong>our</strong>”). This Site is operated by Shogun and has been created to provide information about Shogun and our product and service offerings that post or link to this Privacy Policy now or in the future, including our cloud-based page building software tools and related services (together with the Site, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). This Privacy Policy sets forth how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process Personal Information in connection with our Services.</p><h2>What Is Personal Information?</h2><p>When we use the term “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual.  It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.</p><h2>Our Role in Processing Personal Information</h2><p>Data protection laws sometimes differentiate between “controllers” and “processors” of personal information. A “controller” determines the purposes and means (the why and how) of processing personal information. A “processor,” which is sometimes referred to as a “service provider,” processes personal information on behalf of a controller subject to the controller’s instructions.</p><p>This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices where we are acting as the controller of personal information. However, this Privacy Policy does not cover or address how our customers may process personal information when they use our services, or how we may process personal information on their behalf in accordance with their instructions where we are acting as their processor. As a result, we recommend referring to the privacy policy of the customer with which you have a relationship for information on how they engage processors, like us, to process personal information on their behalf. In addition, we are generally not permitted to respond to individual requests relating to personal information we process on behalf of our customers, so we recommend directing any requests to the relevant customer.</p><h2>Information We Collect</h2><p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below. Sometimes we collect Personal Information automatically when an individual interacts with our Services, and sometimes, we collect the Personal Information directly from an individual.  At times, we may collect Personal Information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.</p><p>We collect Personal Information about different categories of individuals through the provision of our Services and in our capacity as a controller (for additional context, see Our Role in Processing Personal Information section above).  These include our clients and prospective clients (including representatives of our business clients), partners and prospective partners, and visitors to our websites.</p><h5>Clients and Prospective Clients</h5><p>We collect Personal Information from our clients and prospective clients in connection with our Services:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Information provided by our clients and prospective clients to us directly</strong>, such as name, phone number, email address, location (including city, state or region), language information, payment account information, current employment information (such as company name, industry and professional title), profile image and other profile information, and any other information you choose to provide.</li><li><strong>Data collected through the use of the Services</strong>, such as how an individual uses the Services and their actions on the Services, which may include information that an individual provides to us when they contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for a webinar, register for access to the Services or use certain Services, including any third-party application profile data.</li></ul><h5>Job Applicants.</h5><p>We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services.

the scope of this Privacy Policy.  In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information provided at that time.</p><h2>Our Disclosure of Personal Information</h2><p>Shogun is not in the business of “selling” your information as most people think of that term.  We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.  There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information, as set forth in the <a href="https://getshogun.com/privacy#Cookies-and-Online-Ads">Online Advertising</a> section

We Collect and How We Use It</em>:</p><p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve targeted advertisements based on an individual’s browsing history.  We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about an individual’s use of our online Services over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites, or services an individual may use, and on other devices an individual may use.  Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through data collection technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “<strong>data collection technologies</strong>”), which recognize the device an individual is using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date the individual visited the website, AdID, precise geolocation and other information.  We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify an individual across devices.  We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements an individual sees online more relevant to their interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.</p><p><em>Choices About Online Ads</em>:</p><p>We support the self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising (“<strong>Principles</strong>”) published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<strong>DAA</strong>”).  This means that we allow an individual to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about their online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes.  More information about these Principles can be found at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>.  If an individual wants to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on their internet browser from advertisers and third parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please follow the instructions.</p><ul role="list"><li>In the United States, please visit: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"

target="_blank">https://youradchoices.ca/</a></li></ul><p>When electing to opt-out through these sites, they will place an “opt-out” cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  Opt-out cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto.  If an individual wants to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all browsers and devices, they will need to opt-out on each browser on each device they actively use.  If an individual deletes cookies on their device generally, they will need to opt-out again.</p><p>If an individual wants to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on mobile apps, they should follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>.</p><p>Please note that when an individual “opts-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean they will no longer see advertisements from us or on our Services.  It means that the online ads that an individual does see from DAA program participants should not be based on their interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about an individual’s use of our Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.</p><h5>Third-Party Partners and Social Media</h5><p><em>Third-Party Partners</em>:</p><p>We use Google Analytics and other analytics tools to recognize an individual and link the devices they use when they visit our websites or Services on their browser or mobile device, log in to their account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us.  We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address,
