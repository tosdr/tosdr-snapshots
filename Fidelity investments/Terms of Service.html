<li><strong>These Terms contain a Predispute Arbitration Clause that requires that you and Fidelity agree to pursue any disputes in individual arbitration and that each of us waives the right to sue in court, including in a class action or representative proceeding. Please see Section 20, titled “Predispute Arbitration Clause,” for more information.</strong></li>
<li>If you are a customer of Fidelity Investments, or if Fidelity Workplace Services LLC provides employee-benefit-related services to your employer or plan sponsor, your relationship with Fidelity is also governed by your account agreements and related documentation.

By accessing such sections or pages, you agree to be bound by those additional terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict, those additional terms and conditions will govern your use of those sections or pages. You may be asked to execute supplemental agreements before you are permitted to access or use certain features or functionality within the Fidelity websites (each, a “Supplemental Agreement”). In the case of Supplemental Agreements presented to you online, you authorize Fidelity to rely upon “checks” or “clicks” in designated locations as your electronic signature and your agreement to the terms of such Supplemental Agreements. These Terms are in addition to any Supplemental Agreement and are not intended to supersede or modify any such Supplemental Agreement.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Arbitration">Predispute Arbitration Clause</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>These Terms are subject to a predispute arbitration clause. Under this clause, you and Fidelity agree as follows:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this agreement.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All controversies that may arise between you and Fidelity concerning any subject matter, issue or circumstance whatsoever (including, but not limited to controversies concerning any account, order distribution, rollover, advice interaction, or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation or breach of this or any other agreement between you and Fidelity, whether entered into or arising before, on or after the date of these Terms) shall be determined by arbitration through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity, or entities against whom the claim is made is a member, as you may designate.</li>
<li>If you commence arbitration through a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange and the rules of that organization or exchange fail to be applied for any reason, then you shall commence arbitration with any other United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity, or entities against whom the claim is made is a member. If you do not notify Fidelity in writing of your designation within five (5) days after such failure or after you receive from Fidelity a written demand for arbitration, then you authorize Fidelity to make such designation on your behalf. The commencement of arbitration through a particular self-regulatory organization or securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. You understand that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
<li>No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any predispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.</li>
<li>This predispute arbitration agreement survives the termination of the relationship between you and Fidelity, cancellation or end of any particular account or program, and any opt-out by you with respect to Fidelity communications, products, or services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Modification">Modification of These Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fidelity Investments may modify these Terms at any time without notice to you, except where required by law.

Use of the Fidelity websites shall constitute acceptance by you of the Terms in effect as of such time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Law">Governing law</h2>
<ul>
<li>These Terms and their enforcement are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law, and shall inure to the benefit of Fidelity’s successors and assigns, whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Severability">Severability</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision of these Terms to be unenforceable or in conflict with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, either present or future, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</li>
</ul>
