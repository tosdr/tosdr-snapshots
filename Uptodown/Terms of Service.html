</p>
<p>
These Terms are a legally binding agreement between any user who accesses the Website, the Application or the Services (the “User” or “you”)
regarding the use of the Services. Should particular conditions or other specific UPTODOWN (not third parties) rules exist for any of the
Services offered on the Platforms, those conditions shall prevail over these Terms to the extent of any incompatibilities.
</p>
<p>
In relation to the collection and use of the personal data, the <a href="/aboutus/privacy">Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy</a> shall apply.
</p>
<p>

<div class="content">
<ol>
<li>SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD ON THE PLATFORM.
<ol>
<li class="bold">Services
<p>UPTODOWN offers, or may offer in the future, the User the following Services via the Platforms:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>A</b> Access, search, browse and download applications, software, programs and other digital products (“<b>Apps</b>”)
for the User´s mobile device, computer, TV, watch, or other supported device (“<b>Device</b>” or “<b>Devices</b>”, as applicable),
compatible with different operating systems as explained in the Platforms from time to time.
Apps comprise any content, ads, services, technology, data, in-app products or other digital materials included in
or made available through the App (including those provided after you download it). Apps also comprise any updates,
upgrades, modifications and other versions that you later use or download from the Platforms. Except in cases in
which specific agreements with developers apply, UPTODOWN’s activity is limited to providing access and general
information prepared by professionals about Apps. UPTODOWN shall at all times provide links to the websites of the App’s
developer unless requested to withdraw such access by said developer.
</li>
<li><b>B</b> Access to content or forums related to the Apps and Services, such as reviews, videos,
screenshots, articles, or any other related information (“<b>Other Information</b>”).

The Services are provided in accordance with the description, information and features provided
on the Platforms or otherwise by UPTODOWN, and may be modified, updated or deleted, in whole or in part, at any time.
</p>
<p>
To use the Services, the User must have access to the Internet and bear the costs derived from
such access, as well as the necessary equipment for such purpose. It is the sole responsibility
of the User to verify, prior to contracting, the functionalities of the Services and their suitability
to meet their needs, and that the User has the necessary equipment and software for this purpose, paying
the necessary associated costs.
</p>
<p>
The Apps may include offers for products or services intended to be accessed or used within an App,
such as, inter alia, additional or enhanced functionality, media content, or subscription-based access
to content or services (“<b>In-App Products</b>”). No In-App Products available for purchase shall be considered
part of the Services. UPTODOWN is not a party to, nor has any responsibility for any payment or purchase
transactions the User makes through an App.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Restrictions
<p>
The User may not use the Services or access the Platforms and may not accept these Terms if: (a) the User
is not of legal age or capable of accepting these Terms (as provided by applicable regulations) unless duly
authorized by its parents, guardians or legally authorized representatives, or (b) the User is a person
barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the country in which the User is resident or from
which the User uses the Services.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Registration
<p>
In order to have access to certain personalized or specific Services, without this
being compulsory to use the Services on a general basis, the User may register by
creating a username and password and activating an account (the “<b>Account</b>”). To this end,
the User shall provide a valid email address at which the User may receive notifications
related to the Services.
</p>
<p>
In case the User decides to create an Account, the User agrees to provide the mandatory information
that is required for registration and also acknowledges that such information is true,
complete and up to date. It is the User’s responsibility to keep such information updated.
Should the User provide false, outdated or incomplete information, or should UPTODOWN have
reason to suspect this, UPTODOWN reserves the right to suspend or cancel the User’s Account
or restrict the access to the Services through the User’s Account.
</p>
<p>
The User must protect and maintain the confidentiality of the Account’s password without
disclosing it to third parties. The User must not allow third parties to access their Account or use another User's Account.
</p>
<p>
The User is responsible for all acts carried out through the User’s Account in any Device.
If the User suspects that a third party is using their Account, the User should immediately inform UPTODOWN.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Authorized use of the Platforms and the Services
<p>
The User agrees to access the Platforms and use the Services only in accordance with these Terms and in
good faith. The User agrees not to access the Platforms and use the Services negligently, perform or
suggest activities prohibited by law, attempt to attract Platforms’ Users to competitor services or advertise
the sale of products or services for commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>
The User shall refrain from interfering with the Services or other Users’ use of the Services, and in particular,
from impersonating another User or person while using the Services. Likewise, the User agrees not to provide
content to the Platforms (e.g. forums) that is not relevant. Likewise, the User undertakes not to perform
any act that damages, disables, overloads, impairs or prevents the normal use of the Platforms or the Services,
affects their security, or hinders or interferes with them.
</p>
<p>
Access to the Platforms via robots, crawlers or any other device, program, mobile application and/or scripts
to access, copy, or control any part of the Platforms or the Services that is contrary to normal exploitation or
that unjustifiably limits UPTODOWN’s interests is prohibited. Likewise, it is forbidden to obtain or attempt to
obtain the contents of the Platforms or the Services by any means or techniques other than the regular way of use
or those expressly authorized by UPTODOWN.
</p>
<p>
It is strictly prohibited to add serial numbers, cracked software, or similar information, as well as
links to pages that include them, to the Platforms. The IP addresses of offenders shall be saved, and appropriate
legal measures shall be taken against them. The User undertakes not to carry out any conduct that could damage
the image, interests and rights of UPTODOWN, other Users or third parties.
</p>
<p>
The Services are personal and may not be transferred to third parties or be used by third parties other
than the User (including, for these purposes, third parties related to or belonging to the same group of companies),
except in the cases expressly authorized by UPTODOWN.
</p>
<p>
Note that the Apps are offered on the Platforms by their developers. UPTODOWN merely assists in
generating and hosting the Apps without editing, selecting or controlling them. UPTODOWN does not
endorse, warrant or approve any App or opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed in connection
with it, expressly excluding any liability relating to any App.
</p>
<p>
Without prejudice to the fact that UPTODOWN is not obliged to supervise the Apps in general,
UPTODOWN may modify or delete, in whole or in part and at any time, any App or Other Information that,
in its opinion, violates these Terms or may be offensive, illegal or infringing the rights of third parties.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to make any queries regarding an App or Other Information, or believe that they violate any right,
do not comply with these Terms or are inappropriate, you may contact us
at <a href="https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>
</p>
<p>
If it is confirmed that a material breach of the Terms has occurred or that it affects the
rights and freedoms of third parties or causes direct damage to UPTODOWN (e.g. damage to UPTODOWN´s image),
UPTODOWN reserves the right to take appropriate measures, including the immediate suspension or blocking of
access to the Services, as well as to demand the corresponding compensation for the damages caused. All of
the above is without prejudice to any other right or legal action available to UPTODOWN to safeguard its rights and interests.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the affected User whose Account or capacity to access the Services has been restricted by
UPTODOWN as a consequence of the abovementioned measures may request UPTODOWN a review of that decision
by contacting us at <a href="https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PURCHASE TERMS OF THE SERVICES
<p>
Certain Services, as indicated at all times on the Website or the Application, may be subject to
remuneration by the User and must be purchased by the User (hereinafter, the “<b>Services for Purchase</b>”).
</p>
<p>
Services for Purchase are offered, as applicable, on the Website or in the Application, where information
regarding such Services is included.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, UPTODOWN may alter the offer of Services for Purchase, either by proposing new Services
for Purchase or by ceasing to provide any of the Services for Purchase available up to that time.
</p>
<p>
If the User wishes to acquire Services for Purchase, the User shall simply follow the indications
that appear, as appropriate, on the Website or in the Application. Any condition or term shown during
the process of contracting the specific Service for Purchase shall be applicable.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="bold">Registration
<p>
To make an order for a Service for Purchase, the User shall access the Services through an Account.
If the User does not have an Account, the User shall first register following section 1.3 of
these Terms. During the purchasing process, the User shall provide the additional information
requested, such as delivery/invoicing address and tax identification number, as per the instructions
that will be provided on the Website or in the Application.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Prices and Invoicing
<p>
Prices for the Services for Purchase are displayed, as applicable, on the Website or in the
Application, in the relevant currency to the transaction and include, when required, the Value
Added Tax applicable to the transaction depending on the place of delivery and residence of the User.
</p>
<p>
UPTODOWN reserves the right to modify the prices of the Services for Purchase at any time,
but will apply the price in force at the time the order is placed by the User.
</p>
<p>
Before confirming the order and finalizing the purchasing process and making the payment,
the User will be informed of the full final price, including the applicable fees.
</p>
<p>
UPTODOWN will confirm by sending an email to the address associated with the User’s Account,
the contracting of the Services for Purchase performed.
</p>
<p>
The Terms, as well as any particular conditions applicable to the Services for Purchase may be printed
by the User during the contracting process. Likewise, a proof of payment in digital format will
be generated and the User may consult the payments at any time in the Account through the Website.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Payment
<p>
The User may pay for the Services for Purchase with the means of payment accepted from time
to time as established in the purchase process. To make the payment, the User must follow
the instructions that appear on the Platforms.
</p>
<p>
If the User pays by credit card, the User must provide the card details. Payment by credit
card is made through a security system that encrypts your bank details when they are transmitted
over the Internet. The Services for Purchase will not be activated until payment has been
received or authorized by the relevant financial institution. The management of payment
information will be carried out directly between the third-party platforms; no intervention
or access to the users' bank data by UPTODOWN will take place.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Right of Withdrawal
<p>
The User has the right to withdraw from the contract for the Services for Purchase for
fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of contracting (in case of a free period, the
withdrawal period shall also start at the contracting of the Service for Purchase, even
if the payment obligation is not applicable yet). In case of withdrawal, the User will
be refunded for the full payment made.
</p>
<p>
In order to exercise the right of withdrawal, the User must notify the decision to withdraw
from the Services for Purchase through an unambiguous statement (for example, a letter sent
by post, fax or e-mail). You can use the withdrawal form included at the end of these Terms,
although its use is not mandatory.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the User will only be entitled to a refund when required
by law. That is, the refund as a result of canceling the Services for Purchase within
fourteen (14) calendar days from the contracting will only apply to those Users who live
in the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and in those
countries whose regulations require it.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the right of withdrawal will not be applicable, and this is expressly accepted
by the User, in case the Service for Purchase has been fully provided or where the Service for
Purchase implies the supply of digital content in non-material support and the User has
consented such supply of the digital content. In case the Service for Purchase has been partially
provided, the User shall bear the part of the Service for Purchase already provided until
the right is exercised.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Special terms applicable to Subscriptions
<p>
This section 2.5 governs and applies to the purchase of any Service for Purchase consisting
of a premium subscription (hereinafter, the “<b>Subscription</b>”) through the Website or the
Application, in addition to the other terms in this Section 2. Through the Subscription,
the User can access extra functionalities that are not available in the free version of the Services.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, the Subscription may include a free trial period that allows the User
to access and use the extra functionalities free of charge. At the end of the trial period,
effective from the following day, the Subscription will automatically come into effect at
the applicable rate, and the corresponding amount will be charged unless the Subscription
is canceled by the User.
</p>
<p>
By ordering the Subscription, the User authorizes UPTODOWN to charge the corresponding
price through the chosen payment method. Except for free trial periods, the Subscription
will not be active until the payment has been received or authorized by the relevant
financial institution. From that moment, the Subscription will remain in force for the
period contracted by the User.
</p>
<p>
The Subscriptions will be renewed automatically, at the applicable price, successively
upon expiration of their term, until the Subscription is canceled by the User.
</p>
<p>
UPTODOWN may change the price of the Subscription applicable to the renewal or modify
the terms for the Subscription (including its cancellation), provided that it notifies
the User at least one month prior to the date of application.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

The User acknowledges that the elements, functionalities, and utilities integrated into the Platforms
and the Services include content and material owned by or licensed to UPTODOWN, which are protected by
intellectual and/or industrial property legislation.

and transformation or publication of any unauthorized test result for any of the elements or utilities
integrated into the Platforms, constitute an infringement of intellectual and/or industrial property rights
owned by or licensed to UPTODOWN. Therefore, the User is obligated to refrain from engaging in any of
the aforementioned actions. Additionally, it is expressly stated that any data mining of the contents of
the Website or the Application is expressly forbidden.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="bold">Use of the Services available on UPTODOWN
<p>
Subject to compliance with these Terms, UPTODOWN grants the User a non-exclusive, limited, revocable,
personal, and non-transferable authorization to use the Website and Application only to receive the
Services, in accordance with the Terms and to the extent that the Users are entitled to receive them.
Except for this authorization of use, UPTODOWN reserves all intellectual or industrial property rights
in the Services, the Website, the Application, and other elements that compose them.
</p>
<p>
Unless there is a separate license between the rights holder and the User (which can be provided
to UPTODOWN upon request), the User agrees to utilize the Apps and other information available
on the Services exclusively for their own needs and to neither directly nor indirectly engage in
commercial exploitation of the products and/or services to which the User has access, or of the
results obtained due to utilization of the Platforms and the Services.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Prohibited conduct
<p>
The User shall refrain from any conduct in the use of the Platforms and the Services that jeopardizes
the intellectual and industrial property rights of UPTODOWN or its licensors, infringes or transgresses
the honor, personal or family privacy, or image of third parties, or is illicit or damaging to morality.
</p>
<p>
In particular, and without implying any limitation, the User shall abstain from engaging, via the
use of the Platforms and the Services, in any destruction, alteration, disablement, or damage to
the electronic data, programs, or documents belonging to UPTODOWN, its licensors, or third parties.
Nor shall the User introduce or spread on the network any programs, viruses, applets, Active X controls,
or any physical or electronic instrument or device that causes or is susceptible to causing any kind
of alteration to the network, the system, or third-party computers. Likewise, it is expressly prohibited
to engage in any type of activity or practice that violates the principles of good conduct generally
accepted among Internet users.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Content uploaded on UPTODOWN by the User
<p>
The User is solely responsible for all materials or content uploaded, posted, emailed, or otherwise
added by them to the Platforms or the Services (hereinafter the “User Content”). The User warrants
that they hold all intellectual and/or industrial property rights to the User Content. By using the
Platforms and the Services and by uploading, posting, emailing, or adding the User Content, the User
grants to UPTODOWN and its associated and affiliated companies, as well as its collaborators, an
irrevocable, free, and non-exclusive worldwide license, with a right to sublicense, for a duration
equal to the duration of the corresponding rights, to reproduce, transform, distribute, or publicly
communicate the User Content on the Platforms, the Services (current and future), and the pages
of its affiliates, related firms, and/or collaborators, including in the promotion of the above.
UPTODOWN may distribute the User Content to other Users or make any other future use of it via any
medium and/or procedure and in any format.
</p>
</li>
<li class="bold">Requirement to report noncompliance
<p>
Any presumed infraction of rights carried out on the Platforms or Services should be reported to
UPTODOWN by sending an email that includes a description of the presumed infraction to the
following URL: <a href="https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>

<li>
UPTODOWN´S LIABILITY FOR THE SERVICES
<p>
EXCEPT IN CASES OF INTENTIONAL ACTION, AND THOSE IN WHICH, DUE TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE USER
OR OBJECT, AN IMPERATIVE REGIME OF LIABILITY IS DEEMED APPLICABLE, UPTODOWN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE AFFECTING THE USER DUE TO THE USE OF THE PLATFORMS OR OF ANY OF THE SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
IN PARTICULAR, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UPTODOWN ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT OF
THE APPS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD THROUGH THE PLATFORMS, WHICH ARE THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR
DEVELOPERS AND LICENSORS AND SUBJECT TO THE CORRESPONDING LICENSE CONDITIONS FOR SUCH APPS. THE USER ASSUMES
ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWNLOAD AND USE OF THE APPS, EXPRESSLY EXONERATING UPTODOWN OF ALL LIABILITY,
AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT UPTODOWN, EXCEPT IN CASES IN WHICH IT IS EXPRESSLY ESTABLISHED OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED
TO SOLELY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE APPS OF THE CORRESPONDING DEVELOPER OR LICENSOR.
</p>
<p>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable regulations, UPTODOWN does not guarantee the quality,
accuracy, reliability, availability, error-free operation, correctness, or morality of the data,
programs, information, or opinions included on the Platforms, and, in particular, those expressed
or entered in user forums or opinions. However, Users may report presumed abuses or inappropriate
uses of the site through <a href="https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>
to allow UPTODOWN to review the corresponding content.
</p>
<p>
In relation to the Applications and User Content, UPTODOWN acts exclusively as a provider of the
service consisting of enabling the Platforms and the Services so that developers, licensors, and
Users can store and publish the Applications or User Content for the Users. In this regard, UPTODOWN
limits itself to offering an intermediary service by hosting and providing the content, while not
assuming liability for said content beyond the cases expressly provided for in the aforementioned
law; that is, UPTODOWN shall only accept liability when it (i) has actual knowledge that the activity
or information being reported or referred to is illegal, and (ii) has not acted with diligence to
remove or disable the corresponding content.
</p>
<p>
The previous paragraph also applies to links to third-party sites that may be available on the
Platforms or the Services. The publishing of such links does not imply any relationship, sponsorship,
recommendation, or supervision by UPTODOWN of the destination page, and UPTODOWN, therefore,
accepts no liability for its content except in such cases as expressly established in the applicable regulations.
</p>
<p>
The Apps published on UPTODOWN are products created by their respective developers. The Website
or the Application are not directly affiliated with them.
</p>
<p>
Our Platforms distribute original, unaltered software, which is obtained directly from the developers’
websites or by licensors and is not modified in any way.
</p>
<p>
The User assumes as their sole liability any consequences, damages, or actions that may arise
from accessing, playing, using, or disseminating said Apps. It is the responsibility of the User to
verify, prior to downloading, the compatibility of the Apps with their Device and other applications,
as well as their features and the advantages of downloading and installing the App. Likewise, it
is the responsibility of the User to ensure that the download and use of the Platforms and the Services
is legal and appropriate in the User’s location and personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>
UPTODOWN shall not be held liable for the infringements of any developer, programmer, licensor,
or User that affect the rights of another user or of a third party, including rights related to
copyright, trademarks, patents, confidential information, or any other intellectual or
industrial property rights.
</p>
<p>
This limited guarantee and limitation of liability mentioned in the preceding paragraphs shall
neither affect nor prejudice the obligatory rights extended by applicable mandatory regulations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
TERMINATION
<p>
UPTODOWN reserves the right to deny or withdraw access to the Platforms or the Services to a User
if the User violates or UPTODOWN reasonably suspects that the User violates these Terms. In such
cases, UPTODOWN will not incur any liability on account of the termination nor shall it be obliged
to refund any amount that has been paid in advance.
</p>
<p>
The User may terminate the Services and cancel the Account through the Website or the Application
by following the procedure established at any time.
</p>
<p>
UPTODOWN may unilaterally cease to provide any or all Users the Services or the Apps offered via
the Platforms, without prejudice to any remedies it may offer for Users who have contracted
the relevant Services for Purchase.
</p>
</li>
<li>
APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
<p>
These Terms are subject to Spanish law, and Users submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Málaga,
Spain, expressly waiving any other jurisdiction that may apply to them, unless the User´s status
(e.g., as a consumer) requires the application of different legislation or jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 524/2013, you are informed that the European
Commission has an online dispute resolution platform available at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
</p>
</li>
<li>
GENERAL
<p>
In the event that any provision of these Terms is declared invalid or unenforceable, it will be
removed or replaced. In any case, such a declaration of invalidity will not affect the validity of
the other provisions contained in these Terms.
