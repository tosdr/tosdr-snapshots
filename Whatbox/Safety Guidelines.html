        <h3>Reporting abuse</h3>
        <p>If you believe one of our customers is distributing your content without appropriate
        rights or license, you may contact our abuse department via email.
        <p><a href="mailto:abuse@whatbox.ca" class="fs2 outline-button">abuse@whatbox.ca</a></p>


        <h3>Automated enforcement</h3>

        <p>
            Our abuse email supports the ACNS Email Delivery specification.
            By sending ACNS emails, we will scan the reported server, notify the appropriate customer and enforce removal.
        </p>

        <p>
            As with all automation, our response is only as good as your input.
            For good results, please ensure that the ACNS XML payload is accurate and well-formed.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The payload must be valid XML</li>
            <li>The payload must validate against the ACNS XML Schema Definition</li>
            <li>The contents of the payload must be accurate and complete</li>
            <li>Malformed payloads may cause reply delays or even failure</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By sending an email to <a href="mailto:abuse@whatbox.ca">abuse@whatbox.ca</a> containing ACNS XML:
            <ul>
                <li>You understand that malformed payloads may cause processing delays or silent failure</li>
                <li>You release us from liability for such failures if they occur</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Human responses</h3>
        <p>
