        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>
            These Whatbox Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") are entered into by Whatbox Inc. ("Whatbox") and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the "Effective Date").
            If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that
            (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement;
            (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and
            (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.

            1.1 <em>Services Use.</em>
            During the term, Whatbox will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with the Agreement.
        </p>

        <p id="1.2">
            1.2 <em>Accounts.</em>
            Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account.
            Whatbox has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.
        </p>

            (a) <em>To the Services.</em>
            Whatbox may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time.
            Whatbox will inform Customer if Whatbox makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services provided that Customer has subscribed with Whatbox to be informed about such change.
        </p>
        <p id="1.3(b)">
            (b) <em>To the Agreement</em>
            Whatbox may make changes to this Agreement (including the URL Terms) and pricing from time to time.
            Unless otherwise noted by Whatbox, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except where required by applicable law, in which case they will be effective immediately.
            Whatbox will provide at least 30 days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by
            (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address or
            (ii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage.
            If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer may stop using the Services.
            Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under <a href="#8.3">Section 8.3 (Termination for Convenience)</a>.
            Customer's continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute Customer's consent to such changes.

            Nothing in this <a href="#1.3(c)">Section 1.3(c) (Discontinuation of Services)</a> limits Whatbox's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden.
            This <a href="#1.3(c)">Section 1.3(c) (Discontinuation of Services)</a> does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.

        <h3 id="2">2. Payment Terms.</h3>

        <p id="2.1">
            2.1 <em>Prepaid Billing.</em>

        <p id="2.2(a)">
            (a)
            Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Whatbox for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.
            If Whatbox is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Whatbox, unless Customer provides Whatbox with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.
        </p>
        <p id="2.2(b)">
            (b)

        </p>

        <p id="2.3">
            2.3 <em>Payment Disputes & Refunds.</em>
            Any payment disputes must be submitted before the payment due date.
            If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Whatbox, Whatbox will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice.
            If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Whatbox will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice.
            Refunds (if any) are at Whatbox's discretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Services.
            Nothing in this Agreement obligates Whatbox to extend credit to any party.
            Refer to the Refund Policy for more details.
        </p>

        <p id="2.4">
            2.4 <em>Delinquent Payments; Suspension.</em>
            Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.
            Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Whatbox in collecting such delinquent amounts.
            Further, if Customer's payment for the Services is overdue, Whatbox may Suspend the Services.
        </p>

        <p id="2.5">
            2.5 <em>No Purchase Order Number Required.</em>
            Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Whatbox to provide a purchase order number on Whatbox's invoice (or otherwise).
