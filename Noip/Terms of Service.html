            <h3 class="legal">Domain Registration Agreement</h3>

            <p>This Domain Name Registration Agreement ("Agreement")is made by and between No-IP, Inc. ("No-IP"), a Nevada corporation, and you, your heirs, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, "You"), and is made effective as of the date of electronic execution. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of No-IP's Domain Name Registration and represents the entire agreement between You and No-IP. By participating in this transaction, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the ICANN Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy<a href="http://www.icann.org/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1557185954688000" target="_blank" class="text-break">http://www.icann.org/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm</a>&nbsp;along with any new, different or additional terms, conditions or policies, including the Universal Terms of Service which No-IP may establish from time to time. Such terms, conditions or policies may be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/legal/tos">here</a>.</p>
            <p>You also agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses the account You have established with No-IP, whether or not the transactions were on Your behalf. You acknowledge that No-IP's acceptance of any application made by You for services provided by No-IP will take place at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") accredited registrar's offices located in Reno, Nevada, USA.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that No-IP is a registrar bound by an agreement between No-IP and ICANN. You agree that No-IP may modify this agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the terms and conditions set forth by ICANN and/or the Registry Administrator chosen by ICANN, as well as any registration rules or policies that may be published from time to time by No-IP.</p>



            <h3 class="legal">1. Fees</h3>
            <p>In consideration for the services and products ("Service" or "Services") purchased by You and provided to You by No-IP, You agree to pay No-IP at the time service is provided. Payment is to be made by You by providing either a valid credit card, an online check, or using PayPal to establish a cash reserve for charge by No-IP (collectively, the "Payment Method"). All personal checks will be delayed fourteen (14) days until the money is credited, which may delay Your usage of the Service, and any check that bounces will result in a $25 bounced check fee. If You purchase an automatically renewing Service by personal check, it is Your responsibility to arrange for each renewal payment. You understand that ICANN requires No-IP to collect a small registration fee when you purchase your domain name registration. You agree to pay such fees. Payments are non-refundable. If for any reason No-IP is unable to charge Your Payment Method for the full amount owed No-IP for the service provided, or if No-IP is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, You agree that No-IP may pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies No-IP may pursue in order to effect payment include, but will not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to You of any domain names registered or renewed on Your behalf. No-IP reserves the right to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the scope of its regular services. These include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that cannot be handled via email but require personal service, and disputes that require legal services. These charges will be billed to the Payment Method we have on file for You. You may change your Payment Method at any time by logging into Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/login">Account Manager</a>.</p>
            <p>Current fees can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/pricing">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="legal">2. Domain Name Renewals</h3>
            <p>When You register a domain name, your domain name will be automatically renewed on the expiration date. The renewal term will be for one year and will continue to renew at that interval until you cancel the service. No-IP will automatically renew any domain name that is&nbsp;active and not canceled at the end of the service term, and will take payment from the Payment Method You have on file with No-IP, at No-IP's then current rates. If a payment method is not on file,&nbsp;renewal notifications will be sent via email to the email address on file&nbsp;prior to the next billing date.. If for any reason No-IP is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method You have on file, and You fail to pay Your invoice, Your domain name registration will expire. Notices of expiration will be sent via email to the email address on file on the day of expiration.&nbsp;Additionally, Past Due notices are sent via emailafter the expiration date. It is Your responsibility to keep current Your Payment Method information, which includes the expiration date if You are using a credit card.You agree that No-IP will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that You fail to renew. In any case, if You fail to renew Your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If You signed up for domain masking, domain forwarding, or any other similar service, with Your domain registration, these services may be automatically renewed when Your domain registration is up for renewal, and You may incur an additional renewal fee unless You cancel in advance.</p>
            <p>If you fail to renew your domain name, you agree that No-IP may, at its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If No-IP decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse No-IP for the renewal and keep your domain name.&nbsp;The Renewal Grace Period is currently 30 days but subject to change under the terms of Section 3 of this Agreement.&nbsp;If you do not reimburse No-IP for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period, then your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion. At that point, you will have a 30 day period during which you may pay No-IP a Redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The Redemption fee is currently $150 USD. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30 day redemption period, No-IP may, at its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.</p>
            <p>If your domain is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30 day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay No-IP a redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is currently $150. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period, then the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
            <p>Current renewal fees can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/pricing">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="legal">3.    Term of Agreement and Modifications</h3>
            <p>The term of this agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as You have any domain name registered through No-IP. You agree that You will not transfer any domain name registered through No-IP to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days from its initial registration date. You further agree that No-IP may charge You a small fee if You cancel Your domain within the five (5) day grace period after registering Your domain with No-IP. No-IP will not charge You a fee if No-IP cancels Your domain name during this period because of fraud.</p>
            <p>You agree that No-IP may modify this agreement from time to time. No-IP may also discontinue services it provides under this agreement. You agree to be bound by any changes No-IP may reasonably make to this agreement when such changes become effective. Should You elect to cancel Your agreement with No-IP, You will not receive a refund for any fees You may have paid to No-IP.</p>
            <p>You agree that No-IP shall not be bound by any representations made by third parties who You may use to purchase services from No-IP, and that any statements of a general nature, posted on our web site or contained in No-IP's promotional materials, will not be deemed to modify this Agreement or to bind No-IP.</p>
            <p>Modifications to your service can be made at any time during your term. Upgrade charges will be pro-rated based on the number of days remaining on your current term. Upgrades will take effect upon successful payment.</p>
            <h3 class="legal">4. Use and Updating of Your Information</h3>
            <p>You agree to notify No-IP within five (5) business days when any of the information You provided as part of this application and registration process changes. It is Your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status. Failure by You, for whatever reason, to provide No-IP with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis shall be considered to be a material breach of this agreement. Failure by You, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by No-IP to determine the validity of information provided by You shall also be considered to be a material breach of this agreement. You should be sure to print out and retain a copy of the receipt for the purchase of Your domain name(s).</p>
            <p>You agree that for each domain name registered by You, the following contact data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number and, if available, a facsimile number for the registered name holder. The same contact information is required for a technical contact, an administrative contact and a billing contact, if they are different from the registered name holder. You acknowledge and agree that domain name registration process requires that this contact information be shared with the registry operator. As required by ICANN, this information must also be made publicly available by means of Whois, and the registry operator may also be required to make this information publicly available by Whois. Both No-IP and the registry operator may be required to archive this information with a third party escrow service. You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and disclosures. Further, You represent and warrant that, if You are providing information about a third party, You have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the disclosure and You have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.</p>
            <p>You agree that for each domain name registered by You the following information will be made publicly available in the Whois directory and may be sold in bulk as set forth in the ICANN agreement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The domain name</li>
                <li>Your name and postal address</li>
                <li>The email address, postal address, voice and fax numbers for technical and administrative contacts</li>
                <li>The Internet protocol numbers for the primary and secondary name servers</li>
                <li>The corresponding names of the name servers</li>
                <li>The original date of registration and expiration date</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You agree that, to the extent permitted by ICANN, No-IP may make use of the publicly available information You provided during the registration process. If You engage in the reselling of domain names, You agree to provide to any individuals whose personal information You have obtained information about the possible uses of their personal information pursuant to ICANN policy. You also agree to obtain consent, and evidence of consent, from such individuals for such use of the personal information they provide.</p>
            <h3 class="legal">5.    Dispute Resolution Policy</h3>
            <p>You agree to be bound by our current Dispute Resolution Policy and the ICANN the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (&Ograve;UDRP&Oacute;). Our DRP and the UDRP are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. You can view our DRP and the UDRP online. You agree that No-IP may from time to time modify its Dispute Resolution Policy. No-IP will post any changes to its Dispute Resolution Policy at least 30 days before they become effective. You agree that by maintaining Your domain name registrations with No-IP after the updated policy becomes effective You agree to the Dispute Resolution Policy as amended. You agree to review No-IP's web site periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution Policy. If You cancel Your agreement with No-IP as a result of the modified Dispute Resolution Policy, no fees will be refunded to You.</p>
            <p>You agree that if a dispute arises as a result of one or more domain names You have registered using No-IP, You will indemnify, defend and hold No-IP harmless as provided for in this agreement. You also agree that if No-IP is notified that a complaint has been filed with a governmental, administrative or judicial body, regarding a domain name registered by You using No-IP, No-IP, in its sole discretion, may take whatever action No-IP deems necessary regarding further modification, assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event, You agree to hold No-IP harmless for any action taken by No-IP.</p>

            <h3 class="legal">6. Sale and Transfer of Domain Names</h3>
            <p>If You transfer any domain name, You agree to provide the information required by, and to abide by, the procedures and conditions set forth in our Domain Transfer Agreement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/legal/domain-transfer-agreement" class="text-break">http://no-ip.com/legal/domain-transfer-agreement.php</a>. In order to further protect Your domain, any domain registered with No-IP or transferred to No-IP shall be placed on lock status. The domain must be placed on unlock status in order to modify any of the Whois information (including the name servers) or initiate a transfer of the domain name away from No-IP to a new Registrar. You may log into Your account with No-IP at any time after Your domain name has been successfully transferred to No-IP, and change the status to unlock.</p>
            <p>In the event You are purchasing a domain name on behalf of a third party customer, You agree to inform any such customer that they are in fact registering their domain name through No-IP and that No-IP is an accredited registrar with ICANN. You agree to provide complete, accurate and current data for each such registrant to be added to a registry in accordance with ICANN requirements for inclusion in the Whois database. You agree not to represent that You are an ICANN accredited registrar or that You are in any way providing superior access to the ICANN Domain Name Registry. You also agree not to use the ICANN trademark logo in any of Your promotional materials, including Your web site.</p>
            <p>You agree to obtain from each of Your customers written acceptance of No-IP's then current Domain Registration Agreement, and to retain evidence of their acceptance for a period of not less than three (3) years. Should You require that Your customers accept additional terms and conditions beyond those required by No-IP, You agree that such additional terms and conditions shall not conflict with No-IP's Domain Registration Agreement or any of the policies and business procedures adopted by ICANN.</p>
            <p>You agree that No-IP is not lending You access to its registrar connections or its registry access, nor will You be deemed to be a registrar in Your own right by reason of this Agreement. Furthermore, You agree that You will not attempt to gain access to No-IP's registrar connections or registry access.</p>
            <p>You agree to provide Your customers with adequate customer support, and to maintain contact with them with to provide a means for them to communicate changes in the information they provided as part of the domain name registration process. Upon receiving corrected or updated information from them, You will provide such information to No-IP within 5 business days so No-IP may update its registration records. You will retain copies of all communications between You and Your customers and will upon request provide No-IP copies of same.</p>
            <h3 class="legal">7.    Remedies for Breach of Agreement</h3>
            <p>You agree that, in addition to other remedies set forth in this agreement, (i) Your ability to use any of the Services provided by No-IP is subject to cancellation or suspension in the event there is an unresolved breach of this agreement and/or suspension or cancellation is required by any policy now in effect or adopted later by ICANN, and (ii) Your registration of any domain names shall be subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer pursuant to any ICANN adopted specification or policy, or pursuant to any No-IP procedure not inconsistent with an ICANN adopted specification or policy, (1) in order to correct mistakes by No-IP or the registry operator in registering any domain name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning any domain name.</p>
            <p>You agree that Your failure to comply completely with the terms and conditions of this agreement and any No-IP rule or policy may be considered by No-IP to be a material breach of this agreement and that No-IP may provide You with notice of such breach in writing, including electronically (i.e., by email). In the event You do not provide No-IP within ten (10) business days with evidence that You have not breached this Agreement or Your obligations to No-IP, No-IP may terminate its relationship with You and take any remedial action available to No-IP under applicable law. Such remedial action may be implemented without notice to You and may include, but is not limited to, canceling the registration of any of Your domain names and discontinuing any services provided by No-IP to You. No fees will be refunded to You should Your agreement be cancelled or services be discontinued because of a breach.</p>

            <p>If You are hosting Your domain's domain name servers ("DNS") on No-IP's servers, or are using our systems to forward a domain, URL, or otherwise to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if You have your domain name registered with No-IP, You are responsible for ensuring that there is no excessive overloading on No-IP's DNS systems. You may not use No-IP's servers or Your domain as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination address for mail bombs, Internet packet flooding, packet corruption, or other abusive attack. Server hacking or other perpetration of security breaches is prohibited. You agree that No-IP reserves the right to deactivate Your domain name from its DNS system if No-IP deems it is the recipient of activities caused by Your site that threaten the stability of the No-IP network.</p>
            <p>No-IP expressly reserves the right to deny, cancel or transfer any registration that it deems necessary, in its discretion, to protect the integrity and stability of the registry, to comply with any applicable laws, government rules or requirements, requests of law enforcement, in compliance with any dispute resolution process, or to avoid any liability, civil or criminal, on the part of No-IP, as well as its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees. No-IP also reserves the right to freeze a domain name during resolution of a dispute.</p>
            <p>You agree that No-IP, in its sole discretion and without liability to You, may refuse to accept the registration of any domain name. No-IP also may in its sole discretion and without liability to You delete the registration of any domain name during the first thirty (30) days after registration has taken place. No-IP may also cancel the registration of a domain name, after thirty (30) days, if that name is being used, as determined by No-IP in its sole discretion, in association with spam or morally objectionable activities. Morally objectionable activities will include, but not be limited to: activities designed to defame, embarrass, harm, abuse, threaten, slander or harass third parties; activities prohibited by the laws of the United States and/or foreign territories in which we or You conduct business; activities designed to encourage unlawful behavior by others, such as hate crimes, terrorism and child pornography; activities that are tortious, obscene, invasive of the privacy of a third party, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable; activities designed to impersonate the identity of a third party; and activities designed to harm or use unethically minors in any way. In the event No-IP refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration during the first thirty (30) days after registration, You will receive a refund of any fees paid to No-IP in connection with the registration either being canceled or refused. In the event No-IP deletes the registration of a domain name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities, no refund will be issued.</p>
