                                assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                                not to disclose or use the information for any other
                                purpose.

                                your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                                commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                                that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                                of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                                I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
