The Privacy Policy also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. Finally, this Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data collection activities, including personal data that we may collect through our various channels such as websites, apps, third party social networks, retail stores, points of sales and events.</p><p>This is our overall Privacy Policy. For some jurisdictions, additional country/state specific provisions apply. Click here to be directed to the specific provisions.</p><p>In other words, if you’re looking for more information on how we collect, store, use and share your personal data, this is the place for you!</p><h3 id=who-is-responsible-for-your-personal-data>Who is responsible for your personal data?</h3><p>The LEGO Group is made up by several different legal entities spread around the world. You can read more about the LEGO Group here <a href=https://www.lego.com/aboutus>https://www.lego.com/aboutus</a>.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of all the companies in the LEGO Group where LEGO System A/S is the data controller (the one responsible and in charge of the data). In some circumstances a local LEGO Group entity has identified their own data controller for their local country where local processing is taking place. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy when we use “we”, “us” or “our” in this Policy, we are talking about LEGO System A/S.</p><p>We have appointed a data protection officer (“DPO”) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Policy, please <a href=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/legal/privacy-policy/contact-us>contact us</a>.

In many cases this information is already present to you in your online services from us. Your right to access may, however, be restricted by legislation, protection of other persons’ privacy and consideration for the LEGO Group’s business practices, know-how, business secrets and internal assessments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Request correction of incorrect or incomplete data.</strong> If the data we have pertaining to you are incorrect or incomplete, you are entitled to have the data corrected, with the restrictions that follow from legislation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Request erasure</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your data when:</p></li></ul><ol><li>the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;</li><li>you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other legitimate reason for processing;</li><li>you object to the processing and there is no justified reason for continuing the processing;</li><li>or the processing is unlawful</li></ol><p>Please note that, in certain circumstances, we may be required to retain some of your personal data after you have requested deletion to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations. We may also be permitted by applicable laws to retain some of your personal data to satisfy our business needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Limitation of processing of personal data.</strong> If you contest the correctness of the data which we have registered about you or lawfulness of processing, or if you have objected to the processing of the data in accordance with your right to object, you may request us to restrict the processing of this data. The processing will be restricted to storage only, until the correctness of the data can be established, or it can be checked whether our legitimate interests override your interests. Even when processing of your data has been restricted as described above, the LEGO Group may process your data in other ways if this is necessary to enforce a legal claim or to process previously collected data if you have earlier given your consent.</li><li><strong>Object to processing based on our legitimate interest.</strong> You can always object to the processing of personal data about you which is based on legitimate interest. If we are processing your data for direct marketing and profiling in connection to such marketing, your objection will always be sustained. For objections to processing for other purposes, we will conduct a legitimate interest balancing test and consider whether to support your objection.</li><li><strong>Data portability.</strong> You have a right to receive personal data that you have provided to us in a machine-readable format. This right applies to personal data processed only by automated means and on the basis of consent or of fulfilling a contract.</li><li><strong>Other rights.</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with The Danish Data Protection Agency, if you are dissatisfied with the way we process your personal data. You will find the Danish Data Protection Agency’s contact information at <a href=http://www.datatilsynet.dk>www.datatilsynet.dk</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=further-information-updates>Further information: updates</h3><p>If we change the way we handle your personal data, we will update this Privacy Policy.

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, last name, username or similar unique identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.</li><li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers or similar contact data.</li><li><strong>Financial Data</strong> includes bank account and payment card details.</li><li><strong>Transaction Data</strong> includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.</li><li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, user ID, MAC ID and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</li><li><strong>Profile Data</strong> includes your username and password.</li><li><strong>Purchaser Data</strong> includes purchases or orders made by you, services requested, rewards or benefits requested or used, your interests, preferences, and feedback or survey responses.</li><li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes information about how you use our website, products and services.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Communications Data</strong> includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, participate in sweepstakes and other prize competitions and your communication preferences.</li><li><strong>Tracking Data</strong> including data about what pages you visited prior to landing on our websites or where you traveled after visiting our website as well as how you interacted with emails or other messages sent to you by us (e.g. if you deleted or opened the email).</li></ul><p>We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data because this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We use <strong>Pseudonymized Data</strong> in order to minimize the privacy impact to you.</p><p>Pseudonymization is a method that replaces or removes information in the dataset that identifies an individual but permits a data controller or third party to reidentify the personal data with reasonable effort. It is important to be aware that unlike anonymization, pseudonymization does not remove all identifying information from the data but reduces the linkability of a dataset with the identity of an individual.</p><p>We do not proactively collect any <strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong> about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, or genetic information, biometric data for identification purposes, or information about criminal convictions and offences.</p><p>If you fail to provide necessary personal data to us (we will let you know when this is the case, for example, by making this information clear in our registration forms), we may not be able to provide you with our goods and/or services.</p><h3 id=how-does-the-lego-group-collect-personal-data-from-you>How does the LEGO Group collect personal data from you?</h3><p>We collect personal data from the following sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Websites</strong> includes any websites operated by or for the LEGO Group, including sites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and mini-sites that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook.</li><li><strong>Mobile games/apps</strong> includes mobile games or applications operated by or for the LEGO Group, such as smartphone apps.</li><li><strong>E-mail, text and other electronic messages</strong> includes electronic communications between you and the LEGO Group.</li><li><strong>Customer Service</strong> includes calls or online chats with our Customer Service personnel.</li><li><strong>Retail stores,</strong> which includes stores managed by or for the LEGO Group.</li><li><strong>Online registration forms</strong> including LEGO® Insiders account registration, LEGO Life magazine subscriptions.</li><li><strong>Offline registration forms</strong> includes printed registration and similar forms that we collect via, for example, postal mail, in-store demos, contests and other promotions, or events.</li><li><strong>Online consumer contests and sweepstakes</strong></li><li><strong>Our LEGO® Insiders program</strong> including your activities within the program.</li><li><strong>Research</strong> in which you and/or your children may participate, both in person and online.</li></ul><h3 id=personal-data-the-lego-group-may-collect-from-third-parties>Personal data the LEGO Group may collect from third parties</h3><p>We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources as set out below:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical Data</strong> from the following parties:</li></ul><ol><li>analytics providers;</li><li>advertising networks; and</li><li>search information providers.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Contact, Financial and Transaction Data</strong> from providers of technical, payment and delivery services.</li><li><strong>Identity and Contact Data</strong> from data brokers or aggregators.</li><li><strong>Identity and Contact Data</strong> from publicly available sources.</li><li><strong>Identity, Contact and Login Data</strong> from third parties who you have instructed to share data with us (for example, to sign- in to your LEGO account using a third-party game or social media service like Epic Games or Facebook).</li><li><strong>Identity, Contact and Purchaser Data</strong> from retail and entertainment partners such as Merlin Entertainments and LEGO Certified Store partners.</li><li><strong>Tracking Data</strong> from third party platforms such as social media platforms or search engines or websites such as partner websites or applications.</li></ul><h3 id=how-does-the-lego-group-use-your-personal-data>How does the LEGO Group use your personal data?</h3><h4 id=purposes-and-legal-bases-for-processing>Purposes and legal bases for processing</h4><head><style>table,th,td{border:1px solid lightgrey;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;width:25%;<p>}<br>th{<br> background: lightgrey;<br>}<br></style></p></head><details><summary><b>LEGO® apps and online channels</b></summary><table style=width:100%><tr><th>What you do</th><th>What we collect</th><th>Why we collect it</th><th>Legal Basis if residing in the EU/EEA</th></tr><tr><td>Use a LEGO® app or online channel</td><td><ul><li>Technical data</li><li>Usage data</li><li>Tracking data</li><li>Purchase data</li><li>Identity data</li><li>Profile data</li><li>Additionally, data is collected using cookies* on our apps or websites (to the extent you have consented to the use of cookies).

In fact, some features have age gates so to prevent children from inadvertently using such features. We also take all reasonable care to secure that we don’t knowingly collect, store, use or process personal information from children who may use those features without proper parental consent.</p><p>We’ve joined a digital child safety program which audits our company on a yearly basis to make sure we follow the rules in the way interact with children online.</p><p>When it comes to personal data, we seek parental consent for anyone under the age of 16 years (or older, in countries where local laws so require).</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please <a href=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/legal/privacy-policy/contact-us>contact us</a>.</p><p>When we do process personal information from children, we take extra steps to protect their privacy including:</p><ul><li>Making sure we tell parents what personal information we collect, store, use and process from their child and explaining whether we share the information;</li><li>Meeting legal requirements by asking for parental consent to collect, use and process a child’s data and asking for consent to send their children information about our products and services;</li><li>Limiting how we collect, store, use and process personal information from children so only data that is reasonably needed for them to take part in an online activity is collected;</li><li>Giving parents access or the option to ask for access to personal information we’ve collected from their child – parents can also ask for their children’s personal information to be changed or deleted.</li></ul><h4 id=collecting-and-using-childrens-information>Collecting and using children’s information</h4><p>While some of our websites, channels and apps are designed with families and users of all ages in mind, others are intended to be used mainly by children. Whenever we collect personal information from a child, we only keep the information for the time we need it to provide a service or for the time it’s legally required to be kept on record.</p><p>While children can choose whether to share their information with us, there are features of our websites that won’t function if they haven’t given us their information. Where personal information is needed for features to function, we’ll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity.</p><p>Here are some examples of times when we collect children’s data:</p><ul><li><strong>When children register online.</strong> Children can register on our websites to access a variety of services including content, games and competitions. During registration, we may ask a child to provide their parent’s or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name, gender, their birth date, their username and password. We use this information for security and notification reasons. We strongly encourage children to create a username that excludes any personal information.</li><li><strong>When children share content they’ve created themselves.</strong> Some of our websites allow children to create or use content themselves. Since only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian. Whenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we’ll ask the parent or guardian for ‘verifiable parental consent’ (which is a higher level of parental consent). Examples of personal data could be stories, free-text fields, drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information, photographs of the child, sound clips, movie files or any type of content or other persistent identifiers that clearly identifies the child in some way.</li><li><strong>When children enter contests and sweepstakes.</strong> If a child wants to enter a competition, we ask for the personal information we need for a child to take part. We usually only ask for the child’s first name (so we can tell the difference between children from the same family) and the email address of a parent or guardian (so we meet legal requirements to notify the responsible adult). We’ll only contact the parent if the child wins the contest or sweepstake to find out where to send the prize. If the competition asks the child to create content to enter, we may need to ask for parental consent by email in advance to ensure we meet the privacy requirements for content children have created themselves (please see the information above about children creating content). Without consent, children won’t be able to take part in our competitions.</li><li><strong>When children receive emails from us.</strong> We may need to ask for a child’s contact details (including their email address) so that we can reply to a question they’ve asked us. If we need to get in touch with the child a second time, for example to reply to additional questions, we request an email address from their parent or guardian. We then only keep the child’s online contact information for the time it takes us to honor their request and wouldn’t use the information for any other purpose. If we ever need a child’s online contact information for ongoing communication, we ask for the parent’s or guardian’s email address at the earliest opportunity so that we can keep the adult informed of the data we’re collecting and to give the parent an option to ask us to stop collecting data. Parents or guardians can opt out of any communication we have with their child at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication (if there is more than one type of communication, the adult may need to opt out of each individually). Alternatively, they can contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</li><li><strong>When children receive app push notifications.</strong> Many apps send users ‘push notifications’ to their customers’ mobile phones or devices to tell them about updates (sometimes even when the app is not in use). Some of our apps are designed to be used by children. We ask children to provide the email address of their parent or guardian, so we can tell the adult about their child’s request before we send children push notifications from our apps. We don’t link the device identifier with any other personal information without parental consent. If you would like your child to stop receiving push notifications from one of apps, you can change the settings on the device your child’s using at any time.</li><li><strong>When we collect location information.</strong> Some of our websites, channels and apps are designed for children. We request consent from a parent or guardian by email before collecting information on a child’s street name, address or coordinates. We do that because such information will effectively make us able to identify a specific child. As an opposite, we don’t require parental consent to collect information on a child’s city, country or region as long as it isn’t linked directly to the specific child. The reason for this, is that such generic information will not make us able to identify a specific child. If you would like to stop us collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time. Alternatively, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</li><li><strong>When we collect ‘persistent identifiers’.</strong> In order to give visitors to our online channels more relevant and personalized online experiences, we collect some types on information (e.g. information on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data). We collect this information using technologies such as cookies, pixels, flash cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers (which we define under the Cookie section of this Privacy Policy). We may collect this information ourselves or ask a third party to process the data on our behalf. We use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channel and to create anonymous reports. If we ever want to collect children’s personal data for any reason, we would contact the child’s parent or guardian for consent in advance. A list of third-party operators who collect ‘persistent identifiers’ on our sites and apps can be found in our <a href=https://www.lego.com/legal/cookies/cookie-policy/>Cookie Policy</a> and <a href=https://www.lego.com/legal/cookies/cookie-declaration/>Cookie Declaration</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=requesting-parental-consent>Requesting parental consent</h4><p>We use different types of parental consent depending on what type of children’s data we are processing and for what purpose.<br><br><br><strong>Asking for parental consent by email</strong><br>If we need to collect a child’s personal information to provide a service requested by the child, we’ll ask for parental consent according to legal requirements (e.g. COPPA for the US and GDPR for EU). We’ll send the child’s parent or guardian an email explaining what information we’re collecting, how we plan to use it and ask the parent to give or deny their consent. If we don’t receive parental consent in a reasonable time, we’ll delete all information we’ve collected from the child including the adult’s contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.<br><br><br><strong>Asking for ‘verified parental consent’</strong><br>If a child wants to share personal information publicly or with a third party via one of our websites or digital experiences, we’ll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above. We may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), or a review of the parent’s government issued ID.<br><br><br><strong>What if a parent or guardian hasn’t been contacted for consent?</strong><br>If a child under the age of 16 accesses an online channel that’s designed for children by using an age gate, we’ll email the child’s parent or guardian before collecting any personal information from the child. If you think that your child is taking part in an online activity that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasn’t received an email contacting you for consent, please <a href=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/legal/privacy-policy/contact-us>contact us</a>. We won’t use email addresses provided for parental consent for any other purpose unless the adult has expressly opted-in to marketing emails or taken part in an activity which allows email contact.</p><h4 id=parental-choices-and-controls>Parental choices and controls</h4><p>At any time, parents or guardians can refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child. Parents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their child’s account from our records. As personal information is required for some services, deleting a child’s records may result in an account, membership, or service being unavailable to the child in the future.<br>If a child has a registered LEGO Account, parents or guardians can access, change or delete the personal information we’ve collected from their child by:</p><ul><li>Using their child’s username and password to log into their child’s LEGO Account; or</li><li>Getting in touch with our LEGO Customer Service team</li></ul><p>If you’d prefer to <a href=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/legal/privacy-policy/contact-us>contact us</a> please let us know your child’s username along with your own telephone number and email address. We’ll need to confirm your identity as the parent or guardian of the child before granting access to the child’s personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p></summary></details><br><details><summary><b>SECTION 5: INFORMATION FOR KIDS</b></summary><h3 id=information-for-kids-child-friendly-privacy-information>Information for kids: Child Friendly Privacy Information</h3><h4 id=who-are-we>Who are we?</h4><p>We are the LEGO Group and we want to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.
