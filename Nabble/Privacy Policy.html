						<strong>Information you give us.</strong>
						Nabble retains private and personal information only when it is voluntarily submitted by visitors via forms and emails.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong>
						We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This includes:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers.</strong>
								This site uses some unobtrusive cookies to store information on your computer. Some cookies
								on this site are essential, and the site won't work as expected without them. These cookies are
								set when you submit a form, login or interact with the site by doing something that goes beyond
								clicking on simple links. We also use some non-essential cookies to anonymously track visitors
								or enhance your experience of the site.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Log information.</strong>
								Nabble may collect and store certain information in server logs, including details of how you used our service,
								system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, IP address, the date and time of your request and referral URL.

					This basically includes verification of identity, maintaining user preferences, monitoring web traffic,
					investigation of bugs and statistical analysis with the purpose of improving the user experience.
				</p>

				<h2 oswald>Anonymous Usage</h2>

				<p>
					You may use Nabble without divulging any information beyond what is technologically required to retrieve a web page.
					Such usage, however, will limit the availability of certain features, including maintaining an account.
				</p>

				<h2 oswald>Site Owners</h2>
				<p>
					A Nabble "site" is a forum, blog, or any other application created on Nabble with its own subdomain.
					The user who creates a site owns it and can make the content public or private as he/she sees fit.
					This user may also download backups of the data for the site, and this will include any data
					that you have submitted to this site (except passwords, which are encrypted and truncated for security reasons).

				<p>
					Nabble utilizes certain third parties for the normal operation of our service.
					This includes, but is not limited to, providers of hosting, payment gateways, statistical analysis software and advertising networks.
					We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or
					other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type,
					time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
					advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or

					Personal information we collect is not shared with third parties except when approved by you or necessary for the delivery of the service.
					Information may likewise be divulged to aid in the investigation of illegal or forbidden activities and as required by law.
