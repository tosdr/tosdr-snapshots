<h3>10. DO ANY TERMS APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO USING THE APPS?</h3>
<p>Except as expressly stated in this Section 10, these Terms apply to your download and use of our Apps.</p>

<p>You may download a single copy of an App to a mobile device owned or otherwise controlled by you solely for your own personal, non-commercial use. To provide you with certain functionalities, certain of the Apps must access various functions and data on your mobile device. For more information about how personal information is handled by the Apps, please review the <u><a href="./privacy-policy">Coca‑Cola Privacy Policy</a></u> (or other privacy policy or notice made available to you when you downloaded an App).</p>

The Coca-Cola Company aims to provide you with a fast, high-quality service, so any products you order are immediately sent for production. Please double-check your order on screen and your acknowledgement email carefully to ensure that all the details are correct. We cannot refund items where the personalization has been misspelled due to an error made by you.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Note that there are certain names or phrases that will not be approved for personalization due to their double meanings or cultural and religious sensitivities. The Coca-Cola Company and FortyFour must and do reserve the absolute right to decline orders for the product that in their sole judgment and discretion contain subject matter that may be considered inappropriate or offensive, including, without limitation, inappropriate, offensive words, acronyms, symbols or other objectionable content as defined above.
